ment and payatta diligent mindfulness foreword it is with great pleasure that we are now able to publish the complete book of silakkhandha vagga from digha nikaya when the myanmar pitaka association started publishing books from the five nikayas most of the books were translations of selected suttas and not complete books this is because the myanmar pitaka association wished to present to the public pitaka translations covering wide range of the dhamma within short time the first book the “ten suttas from digha nikaya” published in comprised three suttas each from silakkhandha vagga and maha vagga and four from pathika vagga it is the same with later publications from other nikayas thus there are gaps to be filled in all these books the present book fills up gaps in silakkhandha vagga the first book in digha nikkaya it will be the first complete book from digha nikdya and will be followed by the other two books from digha nikaya viz mahé vagga and pathika vagga we hope that this book will receive warm welcome from our readers ol ro sann lwin director general department for the promotion and propagation of the sdsana kaba aye yangon dated december introduction translation of pitaka texts from pali into english the myanmar pitaka association was founded on the of august with the primary aim to promote an understanding of the pitaka texts as interpreted and accepted in theravada buddhism through translations of the pitaka texts from pali into english after the translation of the original sources is completed it was originally intended further to trans late the commentaries and sub commentaries of the theravada school of buddhism the implementation of translation project soon after the myanmar pitaka association was founded there was an intensive search in the whole country for qualified translators the whole of the year was taken up with this task and with the assigning of particular books to those transla tors who were accepted after some testing altogether about twenty translators worked on the translations from the time the translation work started early in four dhamma consultants were always on hand at the head quarters of the association and were available for consultation by the translator the major part of the translation was com pleted within period of some few months nevertheless much editing work remained to be done on the translation manuscripts the editorial committee the editorial committee was formed towards the end of this committee decided to work on the digha nikaya first it also decided that instead of publishing three separate complete books from digha nikaya it would be better to publish selected suttas from the three books as that would take up shorter time to finish and at the same time cover wider field of subject matter thus the committee had chosen three suttas from silakkhandha vagga three suttas from maha vagga vi introduction and four suttas from pathika vagga in collected form as book and published under the name of “ten suttas from digha nikaya’ ‘the editing of the book was completed in november the book came out in in the same way in dealing with majjhima nikaya twenty five suttas cach were chosen from mdlapannasa from majjhimapannasa from uparipannasa and published as separate books from anguttara nikaya khuddaka nikaya and sam yutta nikaya also selections were published thus there are number of gaps in all the five nikayas nevertheless during this time we have been able to bring out fair number of transla lions from various nikayas after publication of these books the editorial committce feels it is time for us to fill up the gaps and present complete books to our readers here again we start filling up the gaps with digha nikaya our first book is silakkhandha vagga this is followed by maha vagga and pathika vagega silakkhandha vagga this is the first book from digha nikaya the collection of long discourses of the buddha it is the division of discourses on morality there are altogether thirteen suttas in this vagga they are brahmajala sutta samafinaphala sutta ambajtha sutta sonadanda sutta kidtadanta sutta mahali sutta jaliya sutta mahasihanada sutta potthapada sutta subha sutta kevatta sutta lohicca sutta and tevijja sutta of these brahmayala sutta samafinaphala sutta and potthapada sutta were included in the “ten suttas from digha nikaya” the first book published by myanmar pitaka association in brahmajala sutta the net of perfect wisdom this is the first sutta in silakkhanda vagga and is the most well known once the bhagava was travelling from rajagaha to nalanda with following of five hundred bhikkhus the wandering ascetic suppiya and his pupil brahmadatta were also travelling the same journcy this discourse was given to the introduction eo vu bhikkhus in connection with them suppiya was all the time maligning the buddha the dhamma and the sanigha while his pupil brahmadatta praised the buddha the dhamma and the samgha when the bhikkhus reported this matter to the bhagava he said “bhikkhus if others should malign the buddha the dhamma and the sanigha you must not feel resentment nor displeasure nor anger on that account he also told them not to feel pleased or delighted or elated should others praise the buddha the dhamma and the samgha minor morality middle morality higher morality the buddha also pointed out that worldling puthujjana when he praises the tathagata might do so only in respect of trifling and inferior matters mere morality this means moral ity sila as such is trifling and inferior when compared with concentration samadhi and wisdom pafifid the buddha futher explained to the bhikkhus the three kinds of morality viz minor morality cala sila middle morality majjhima sila and major morality maha sila minor morality is basic morality most of which is applicable to all the other two are more comprehensive mostly applicable to samanas and brahmanas the profound tranquil and noble dhamma the buddha then continued thus “bhikkhus besides morality there are other dhammas which are profound hard to see hard to comprehend tranquil noble surpassing logic subtle and intelligible only to the panditas ariyas who have attained one of the four maggas the tathagatha has set them forth after realization of these dhammas by himself through sabbafifiuta nana perfect wisdom anyone wishing to praise correctly the true virtues of the tathagata should do so in terms of these dhammas this in fact is the dhamma which surpasses the sixty two wrong views of the ascetics introduction numbering one thousand two hundred and fifty” cuncuasui jivaka suggested “let your majesty attend on the bhiyavi and if you should attend on him your mind might become clear and calm king ajatasattu accepted jivaka suggestion then with his full retinue of ministers attendants etc the king set forth from rajagaha to the mango prove of jivaka there the king saw the bhagava who was sitting against the middle pillar of the pavilion facing east he approached the bhagavad paid homage to him and stood in suitable place he looked again and again al the huge assemblage of bhikkhus who were seated in perfect silence and calm as the waters of clear lake he was indeed very much inpressed by the peaceful assembly of bhikkhus questions on the fruits of the life of samana king ajatasattu then asked the bhagava “can you venerable sir reveal to me the advantages to be gained in this very life from being samana the bhagava gave his answer to the above question with the example of servant and of farmer it occurred to them independently thus the state ot one existence conditioned by meritorious deeds and the resultant effect of such deeds etc “had done meritorious deeds could have been like the king of magadha who enjoys to the full the five pleasures of the senses as if he were deva now it were better for me to shave otf my hair and beard don the bark dyed robe renounce hearth and home and become recluse leading the homeless life thus reflecting both the servant and the farmer become recluses having become recluses they exercised self control in bodily verbal and mental actions were content with what they could get for food and clothing and took delight in solitude now that they are recluses would not be proper for the master and the landholder to call them back and let them be servant or farmer instead the master and the landholder should pay respect to them welcome them and invite them to be introductivon xl seated make offerings of the four requisites and provide security and protection for them according to law this is the advantage of being samana personally experienced in this very life higher and better advantages of samana life king ajatasattu next asked the tathagata whether there are other advantages higher and better than those previously mentioned the answer was in the affirmative the tathagatha then told him about householder or his son or anyone else who might have heard the dhamma taught by the tathagata after listening to the dhamma that person developed faith and conviction in the tathagata felt like leaving the household life for the homeless life of recluse he gave up his wealth left his relatives shaved off his hair and beard donned the bark dyed robe renounced hearth and home and became recluse leading the homeless lite on becoming samana he practises self restraint in accordance with the fundamental precepts patimokkhasanivara silev vit ses ube moral precepts ciila sila majjhima sila and maid sila well he has his sense faculties guarded he atains mindfulness and clear comprchension he is contented he dissociates himself from the five hindrances nivarana and from all demeritorious factors viz covetousness ill will sloth and torpor rosticssness and worry and doubt eventually he attains the first second third and fourth jhanas one after the other the attainment of each one of the jhanas is an advantage of being samana personally experienced which is higher and better than the advantages previously mentioned when he has reached this stage he directs and inclines his mind to the development of insight knowledge vipassana nana by which he can create mentally generated form complete with all organs next he directs and inclines his mind to the development of psychic power iddhivida nana with which he wields the various kinds of supernormal powers he also directs and inclines his mind to the gaining of the hearing power like the divine power of hearing dibbasota nana xu introducuon directs and inclines his mind to discriminating knowledge of the minds of others cetopariya nana directs and inclines his mind to the knowledge of past existences pubbenivasa nana directs and inclines his mind to the divine power of sight which is extremely clear surpassing the ‘sight of men dibbacakkhu nana and finally he directs and inclines his mind to the knowledge of extinction of moral intoxicants asavakkhaya nana the attainment of each one of these eight knowledges vijjas is an advantage of being samana personally experienced which is higher and better than the advantages previously mentioned the highest and best advantage on attaining the asavekkhaya nana the bhikkhu truly understands dukkha the cause of dukkha the cessation of dukkha and the practice lit path leading to the cessation of dukkha he also truly understands the asavas the cause of the asavas the cessation extinction of the asavas and the practice leading to the cessation extinction of the savas the mind of the bhikkhu who thus knows and thus sees is liberated from the asavas viz the craving for pleasures of the senses kamasava the hankering after better existances bhavasava clinging to wrong views ditthasava and ignorance of the four ariya truths avijjasava this knowledge of extinction of asavas asavakkhaya nana is the highest and the best advantage of the life of samana the tathagata himself has said thus “great king there is no other advantage of being samana personally experi enced more pleasing and higher than this which one can see for oneself king ajatasattu becomes lay disciple at the end of the discourse king ajatasattu of magadha took refuge in the three gems the buddha the dhamma and the samigha he pleaded with the bhagava to take him as lay disciple from that instant to the end of his life the king also asked the bhagava to accept the admission of his guilt introduction xiil killing his father for the sake of gaining sovereign power so that he would restrain himself in the future the bhagava replied “now as you have realized your guilt and admitted to make amends we accept your admis sion then king ajatasattu of magadha paid obeisance to the bhagava and departed with his retinue soon after the king had left the bhagava said to the bhikkhus “bhikkhus this king has destroyed himself bhikkhus had not this king put his father to death who ruled with righteousness and kingly virtue there would have arisen in him here and now the clear and undefiled eye of the dhamma sotapatti magga note although king ajatasattu failed to attain sotapatti magga immediately after listening to the above discourse given by the tathagata he did gain some other benefits for example he could now sleep well at nights and having developed much faith in and devotion to the buddha the dhamma and the sam gha he did his utmost in promoting the welfare progress and promotion of the buddha teaching sasana for these acts of merit done out of faith and devotion to the three gems instead of suffering in the avici niraya he had to suffer only in lohakumbhi niraya lesser niraya after the completion of his term in that niraya and after performing and fulfilling various acts of perfection parami he would become paccekahbuddha and finally realize parinibbana commentary ambattha sutta this discourse is named after the youth ambattha pupil of the brahmana pokkharasati once the bhagava was making tour of the country of the kosalans with company of bhikkhus numbering five hundred and stopped at icchanan gala forest grove near brahamana village there was much talk among the people about the bhagava arrival and about the supreme attributies of the bhagava the brahmana pokharasati wished to verify the news wanted to make sure whether he is xiv introducuon ceally an arahat who is perfectly self enlightened he thought that it would indeed be good to pay respect to such person worthy of’ veneration so he called his pupil ambaftha and told him to find out whether the bhagava was truly great man one who pos sesses all the thirty two bodily marks mentioned in the vedas for great man possessing these marks there are only two alternative destinies one leading household life would surely become universal monarch who has come to the throne by virtue of righteous conduct ruling over the four island conti nents four oceans ete or one leading homeless life of recluse would be buddha worthy of special veneration per fectly self cnhghtened etc so young ambattha took leave of his teacher pokkharasau and set forth with company of young brahmanas to the cchanangala forest grove where the bhagava was slaying on his meeting with the bhagava young ambattha was disrespectful rude and insolent in his behaviour towards the bhagava saying few words here and there walking about or standing while the bhagava was seated the bhagava then reminded him about the purpose of his visit to the bhagava and to keep his mind well on it he also said that ambattha was indeed ill taught and ill trained this made ambattha very angry and he retaliated by disparaging the sakyans saying that they were of low birth etc thus he degraded the sakyans three limes and quite severely too so the bhagava thought it was the proper time tor him to talk to young ambattha and asked him about his lineage on getting his reply that he was kanhayana by lineage the bhagava pointed out to him that whereas the sakyans were the descendents of master race he ambattha was descendent of slave girl belonging to one of the sakyans but ambattha was reluctant to accept or to reveal this fact when the bhagava again asked him about his ancestry he ramained silent when the question was repeated also he was silent but when sakka king of the devas taking the guise of introduction xv the bhagava and ambattha ambattha got frightened and admit ted that he was indeed descendent of slave girl knowledge and practice of morality vijjacarana after that there was some more talk about the lineage of ambattha and about brahmanas and the khattiyas towards the end of the talk the bhagava said to ambattha “eminent are the khattiyas among people who put reliance on their lineage but among devas and men he who is endowed with knowledge and practice of morality stands out as pre eminent the bhagava then added “ambattha those who are not bound by notions of birth lineage or pride will realize for themselves perfection in incomparable knowledge and practice of morality young ambattha then asked the bhagava about’ the incomparable knowledge and the perfect practice of morality the bhagava gave detailed reply to this question thus in this text there is long description of the three kinds of morality cala sila majjhima sila and maha sila description of mind fulness and comprehension dissociation from sensual desire ill will sloth and torpor restlessness and worry and doubt and description of the attainment of the four jhanas this part deals with practice or conduct carana after this there is detailed account of the attainment of the eight kinds of knowledge vijjas viz insight knowledge vipassana nana power of creation by mind supernormal power the divine power of hearing knowledge of minds of others knowledge of former existences divine power of sight and knowledge of the extinction of asavas this section on knowledge and conduct is very important part of this sutta for it is defnitely mentioned here that it is not one of high birth nor xvi introduction lincage but one endowed with the incomparable knowledge and perfect practice of morality who is the most cminent and most noble among devas brahmas and men revealing the two bodily marks then the bhagava went to the covercd walk outside the monastery ambattha followed the bhagava and examined the thirty two bodily marks of great man he noticed almost all the thirty two marks except the two the private part encased in sheath and the long extensive tongue the bhagava knowing that ambattha was perplexed and very much in doubt by exercise of his supernormal psychic power revealed those two bodily marks to ambattha ambattha was satisfied and con vinced that the samana gotama was fully endowed with the thirty two marks of great man ambattha returned’ to his teacher brahmana pokkharasau and reported to him that samana gotama was fully endowed with the thirty two marks of great man and not parually at that very instant strong desire arose in brahmana pokkharasati to go and see samana gotama himself brahmana pokkharasati approached the bhagava on meeting with the bhagava brahmana pokkharasati told the bhagava that ambattha was being foolish and asked the bhagava to forgive him brahmana pokkharasati next exam ined the bodily marks of great man on the body of the bhagava to him also the buddha revealed those two bodily marks with the exercise of his supernormal psychic power brahmana pokkharasati was quite satisfied with what he saw then he made offerings of almsfood to the bhagava brahmana pokkharasati personally attended on the bhagava offering choice hard and soft food with his own hands ull the bhagava caused him to stop signifying he had had enough introduction xvii delivery of discourses to brahmana pokkharasati after finishing the almsmeal the bhagava delivered series of discourses to brahmana pokkaharasati he started with the discourse on charity then he went on to morality celestial realms faults of sensual desire vileness of sensual desire defil ing effects of sensual desire and advantages of freedom from sensual desire then finding that the mind of brahmana pokkharasati was in fit condition to take in the dhamma the bhagava also expounded to him the four ariya truths brahmana pokkharasati becomes lay disciple just as clean unsoiled piece of cloth readily takes in the dye so also brahmana pokkharasati took in the truth and gained the eye of wisdom he attained sotapatti magga nana and then and there realized that whatever has the nature of arising has the nature of cessation thus brahmana pokkharasati readily took in the dhamma then he addressed the bhagava extolling the dhamma and requested the bhagava to take him and his family as lay disciples sonadanda sutta this is the discourse given by the bhagavad to the brahmana sonadanda it is an exposition of knowledge and morality once the bhagava was making tour of the country of anga with company of five hundred bhikkhus he stopped at the town of campa and stayed by the bank of lake gaggara nearby the brahmana sonadanda from the town of campa came to see the bhagavad after exchange of greetings and some coversation the brahmana sonadanda requested the bhagava to elucidate to him the meaning of the terms morality and ‘knowl edge’ thus the bhagava gave discourse on morality and knowledge the same lines as he did in samafifiaphala sutta first he dealt with minor morality middle morality and higher xvili introduction morality then going on to the four jhanas and the eight catagorious of knowledge vijjas beginning with insight knowl edge vipassana nana and culminating in asavakkhaya nana in this discourse distinction is made between accom plishment in morality and accomplishment in knowledge the three kinds of morality and the attainment of the four jhanas constitute morality the cight categories of knowledge constitute knowledge morality and knowledge however are interdepen dent this fact is pointed out in the text both by the bhagava and the brahmin sonadanda it said knowledge is washed clean by morality and so is morality washed clean by knowledge just as one hand washes the other or one foot washes the other one who is accomplished in morality is also accomplished in knowledge in this world morality and knowledge are deemed to be the most supreme thus both morality and knowledge are very important in our lives at the end of the discourse the brahmin sonadanda requested the bhagava to take him as lay disciple who takes refuge in the buddha the dhamma and the sanigha kuftadanta sutta this discourse was given by the bhagava to the brahmana kitadanta once the bhagava was touring the country of magadha with company of five hundred bhikkhus and stopped at ambalatthika garden near the brahmana village of khanumata brahmana kifadanta of khanumata village was preparing great secrifical feast involving the sacrifice of large number of bulls heifers sheep goats etc this brahmana together with his friends came to see the bhagava and requested the bhagava to tell him about the three mental attitudes towards sacrifice together with their sixteen supporting factors sacrificial feast of king mahavijita to him the bhagava related about the sacrificial feast of king mahavijita very rich king of the times long past this king wanted to hold grand sacrificial feast as he wished to introduction re have prosperity and happiness for long he consulted his minis ter purohita purohita did not advise the king to hold grand expensive feasts due to existing unsettled condition the country being rankled and hurt by thievery and plundering in towns and villages followed by highway robbery when peace and prosperity returned the king again asked his minister about holding the grand feast his minister then advised the king to consult and get the consent of the khattiya vassals ministers and officials wealthy brahmanas and rich householders they gave their consent saying “do make the offering it is the suitable time your majesty thus these four concenting parties constitute factors supporting the sacrifice the remaining twelve supporting factors include such qualifica tions as having good and pure lineage good appearance wealth intelligence generosity ability to assess past present and future events and for brahmana purohita to be past master of the vedas and to be able to recite mantras etc the correct mental attitude toward sacrificial feast is to have no regrets saying “alas my immense wealth has become depleted’’ as one is preparing to hold the feast ii or while one is holding the feast ii or after one has held the feast instead of harbouring regrets one should give away freely and feel glad about it with clarity of mind thus should one hold sacrificial feast or offering sacrifices entailing less trouble and exertion but more fruitful than the above the brahmana kiftadanta then asked the bhagava whether there were other forms of sacrifice which entail less trouble but more fruitful than the above to this question the bhagava replied in the affirmative and gave list of the various forms of sacrifice which are all more fruitful and more rewarding than the sacrificial feast the list is as follows alms giving in constant practice the traditional sac rifice dedicated to bhikkhus established in morality ii donation of monastery xx introduction iii taking rufuge in the buddha the dhamma and the sami gha iv observance of moral precepts sacrifice relating to attainment of jhanas vi sacrifice leading to attainment of asavakkhaya nana which is the execellent and the most eminent perfection in sacrifice request for lay discipleship the brahmana kttadanta next requested the bhagava to take him as lay disciple from that time on to the end of his life he also set free the bulls heifers sheep goats etc that had been brought for sacrifice the bhagava then delivered series of discourses in their sequence to brahmana kutadanta in the same way as he did to brahmana pokkharasati ambattha sutta brahmana kiutadanta also took in the dhamma readily just like clean unsoiled piece of cloth takes in the dye and he came to be established in sotapatti fruition mahali sutta this discourse was given by the bhagava to mahali and his followers in monastery near vesali here the bhagava explained to mahali why one sould not contine oneself to one sided concentration or to two sided concentration in practising the dhamma in fact the bhagava instructed his bhikkhus not to confine themselves to one sided concentration on visible object or to two sided concentration on visible object and sound nor to be satisfied with just the attainment of jhanas the bhikkhus were told to take up the noble practice brahmacariya under the guidance of the bhagava with view to the realiza tion of the four noble fruitions viz sotapatti fruition sakadagami fruition anagami fruition and arahatta fruition the attain ment of arahatta fruition means becoming an arahat with the mahali is the personal name of otthaddha king of the licchavis uction introd xxi realization by himself the emancipation of mind cetovimutti and emancipation by insight arahatta pafifia through extinction of dsavas these dhammas are realized by the practice of the path of eight constituents viz right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration jaliya sutta this discourse was given by the bhagavad to two wan dering ascetics mundiya and jaliya at ghositarama monastery near kosambi they came to the bhagavad and asked’ this question “is physical body life or “is life physical body or “is life one thing and physical body another by way of answer the bhagava delivered to them discourse on the various stages of the practice of the dhamma starting from accomplishment in morality to the attainment of jhanas of insight knowledge etc leading to attainment of the knowledge of extinction of dsavas to one who has thus completed the task for the attainment of magga one who has attained knowledge of extinction of asavas the answer to the above question is quite clear even mundiya and jaliya realized it ani admitted that “it will be improper for one to tell that bhikkhu who knows the path and sees thus “physical body is life or “life is physical body or “life is one thing and physical body is another the bhagava also said do not say “physical body is life or “life is physical body or “life is one thing and physical body is another the two wandering ascetics approved what the bhagava has said note if the bhagava had given the answer in the affirmative to the first part of the question these ascetics would accuse him of holding the annihilation views uccheda ditthi if he were to give the answer in the affirmative to the second part of the question they would accuse the bhagava of holding the eternity view sassata ditthi xxil introduction mahasihanada sutta this discourse by the bhagava was given to the ascetic kassapa at deer park near the town of urufina the naked ascetic kassapa came to the bhagava as he wanted to find out whether it was true that the bhagava disparaged all self morti fication and condemmed all ascctics who lead an austere life these ascetic practices of sclf mortification are taken by the ascetics to be the tasks of samanas and brahmanas such practices include actions like going naked taking food at intervels of one or two days or even fifteen days living on pot herbs or grains of millet wearing coarse hempen cloth etc then there was discussion on how one becomes samana or brahmana and when to the ascetic kassapa the bhagava pointed out that one cannot become true samana or brahmana by means of the practice of self mortification such mortification practices of ascclics as mentioned above are futile one undertaking these practices is far from being samana or brahmana unless he has practised and realized perfection in morality concentration and knowledge true samana or brahmana in this practice laid down by the bhagava the bhikkhu cultivates mind of non hatred non malice and loving kindness and dwells in the realization by himself in the present life of the emancipation of the mind cetovimutti and of emancipation by insight arahattaphala panna due to extinction of dsavas this bhikkhu is called samana or brahmana this is the true samana or brahmana who is endowed with morality concentra tion and knowledge brave uttcrance of the bhagava the lion roar in the above practice the buddha stressed the importance of being endowed with perfection in morality in concentration and in knowledge in all these three aspects the bhagava introduction ah xx declared himself to be the most supreme this declaration is generally likened to the “lion roar’ some examples go the furthest in the conduct of the most supreme form of morality adhisila ii go the furthest in the practice of the most supreme form of intense self mortification adhijeguccha iii go the furthest in the acquisition of the most supreme form of knowledge adhipafifia iv go the furthest in the realization of the most supreme form of emancipation adhivimutti etc thus is the bhagava the most supreme potthapada sutta in the potthapada sutta the discourse given by the bhagava to potthapada and his followers at ekasalaka hall near sdvutthi the subject of discussion was the arising of safifia associated with the attainment of jhanas and the cessation of safifid nirodha samapatti continuing the discussion the bhagava also laid down the dhamma certain to lead to nibbana this dhamma is the dhamma that is conducive to the realization of the four ariya truths viz the ariya truth of dukkha the ariya truth of the cause or orgin of dukkha the ariya truth of the cessation of dukkha and the ariya truth of the practice lit path leading to cessation of dukkha subha sutta this discourse was given by the venerable ananda to young subha son of todeyya the subject of the discourse was ‘groups of dhamma praised by the bhagavad the three groups of dhamma here are group of moral precepts group of concen tration and group of knowledge kevatta sutta in this discourse given by the bhagavad to kevafta son of wealthy householder at pavdrika mango grove in nalanda the subject of discussion was ‘miracles’ the three kinds of xxiv introductton miracles are those performed by means of supernormal psychic power iddhi pauhariya those performed by means of the power of revealing other people mind desana patihariya and those performed by means of admonition or instruction anusasani pauhariya the bhagava has by himself realized all these three kinds of miracles through abhiiiia perfect wisdom sabbafifiuta hana but secing the faults of psychic power and the power of revealing other people mind the bhagava was very much averse to the exercise of those two powers the third kina of miracle involves giving instructions for the attainment of jhanas etc leading to the attainment of insight knoweledge and the other knowledge vijjas culminating in the knowledge of extnc lion of dsavas asavakkhaya nana of the three kinds of miracles this last kind is the most superior lohicca sutta this discourse was given by the bhagava to brahmana lohicca lord of sdlavatika village at that same village in this discourse four types of teachers are mentioned three of the four deserve criticism but the fourth teacher is one who should not be criticised the teachers who should be criticised the bhikkhu teacher has not yet actually enjoyed the fruits of the life of bhikkhu he teaches his puipls what is beneficial for them what would bring them happiness his puipls do not obey him nor show any interest in the knowledge imparted to them this teacher deserves criticism the bhikkhu teacher has not yet actually enjoyed the fruits of the life of bhikkhu he teaches his pupils what is beneficial to them what would bring them happiness his pupils obey him and gain the benefits of the teaching this teacher also deserves criticism the bhikkhu teacher has enjoyed the fruits of the hfe of bhikkhu he teaches his pupils what is beneficial tor them introduction xxv what would bring them happiness his pupils do not obey him nor show any interest in the knowledge imparted to them this teacher also deserves criticism the teacher who should not be criticised the bhikkhu teacher who is accomplished in morality who is endowed with concentration and with knowledge teaches his pupils what is beneficial to them and what brings them happiness under such teacher the pupil also gains the highest perfection in the dhamma this teacher does not deserve to be criticised if he be criticised such criticism is untruthful and unjustified tevijja sutta once the bhagava was staying at the mango grove on the bank of river aciravati to the north of the brahmana village of manasakata many distinguished and wealthy brahmanas were also staying at manasakata village then conversation arose between vasettha and bharadvaja the two young brahmanas the subject of their conversation was “the true or the false path that leads to companionship with the brahma” there was much talk between them about the paths as laid down by the brahmanas who were well versed in the vedas but none of them could convince the other over these views thus they came to the bhagava to get his opinion at the request of vasettha the bhagavad gave the dis course on the way to the brahma world this path as laid down by the bhagava is as follows first the bhikkhu is accomplished in morality he has dispelled the five hindrances nivaranas the bhikkhu dwells in state of mind filled with loving kindness compassion sympa thetic joy and equanimity pervading all cardinal points and then everywhere above below and around thus does he dwell diffusing the entire world of sentient beings identified with himself with the mind filled with loving kindness compassion sympathetic joy and equanimity extensive lofty measureless xxvi introduction free from hatred free trom ill will these states of mind consu tute the path leading one to be together with the brahma by this time the bhikkhu mind is without enmity is therefore healthy and undefiled he has gained mastery over his mind this mastery over his

saying things directly as explained in the commentary the buddha through his faculty of knowing other people minds and through his omniscience already knew all that had happened and all that had been discussed in his absence but it was customary for him to ask the bhikkhus or lay disciples what they had been discussing as an introduction to discourse he would give on the subject brahmajala sutta

intelligible only to the pandita ariyas who have attained one of the four maggas the tathagata has set them forth after realization of these dhamma by himselt through sabbafifuta nana perfect wisdom anyone wishing to praise correctly the truce virtues of the tathagata should do so in terms of these dhammas and what are the dhammas which are profound hard to see hard to comprehend tranquil noble surpassing logic subtle and intelligible only to the ariyas the buddha answered this question by means of graduated discourse beginning with eighteen wong views relating to the past as follows dhammas the commentary says that here the dhammas referred to are sabbannuta mana the buddha sabbaniiuta hana encompasses magga insight brahmajala sutta rightce° wrong views xclating to th past eyniautanwd thi note synopsis insevic here to facilitate understanding of the eighteen wrong views relating to the past synopsis of wrong views the brahmajala sutta sets forth sixty two kinds of worg views which are held by samanas and brahmanas these sixty two kinds of wrong views are classified into two categories namely pubbantanuditthi and aparantanuditthi pubbantanuditthi means the group of wrong views which are based on the past existences aparanatanuditthi means the group of wrong views which are thoughts or speculations on the future pubbantanu ditthi is further classified into five’ sub categories they are as follows sassata ditthi ekacca sassata ditthi antananta ditthi amaravikkhepa ditthi adhiccasamuppanna ditthi the following are brief explanations on the above mentioned five sub categories sassata ditthi is group false views of eternity which says that atta as well as loka is eternal there are four different views in this group namely the first eternity view the second etemity view the third eternity view and the fourth eternity view ekacca sassata ditthi is group of false views of etemity which says that atta and loka are in some cases eternal and in other cases not eternal there are four different dualistic views in this group namely the first dualistic view of eternity the second dualistic view of eternity the third dualistic view of eternity and the fourth dualistic view of eternity antdnanta ditthi is group of false views on the finiteness or otherwise of the world system as represented by the mental image of the earth device used in meditation there are four different views in this group namely the first view which says ithe world system is finite the second view which says it is infinite the third view which says it is finite vertically and infinite horizontally and the fourth view which says it is neither finite nor infinite silakkhandha vagga amaravikkhepa difthi false views that make one sit on the fence to be on the safe side for example question is put to person who does not know the answer he does not want to admit that he does not know at the same time he fears that the wrong answer would cause him distress which might be harmful to him therefore hé answers the question thus “i don take it this way neither do take it that way and don take it the other way neither do take it not this way nor that way nor the other way and also don take it that it is otherwise there are four causes that make the samanas and brahmanas in this group sit on the fence the first sits on the fence because of the fear that the wrong answer would cause him distress which might be harmful to him the second sits on the fence because of the fear that the wrong answer might cause the arising in him of mental defilements which would in tum cause distress that might be harmful to him the third sits on the fence because of the fear of his being taken to task for the wrong answer the fourth sits on the fence because of lack of wisdom adhiccasamuppanna ditthi false views that atta as well as loka arises without cause there are two groups of persons who hold this view the persons belonging to the first group were asaffiasatta brahmas in their previous existence these brahmas are so called because they are the brahmas who have only body and no mind in order to achieve this kind of rebirth those who are desirous of having it have to pracitse the safifia viraga bhavana in simple terms it means bhavana for the extermination of mind even though it is so called it does not exterminate mind it only suspends the arising of mind when the effects of safifia virdga bhavana come to an end the mental process that has been suspended arises generally as the patisandhi citta the first citta of human being in simple terms it can be said thus when an asafifiasatta brahma dies he is generally rebron as human being when he comes of age he may acquire through the practice of meditation psychic power which would enable one to recall the past since however he was an asafifiasatta brahma in his previous existence his psychic power cannot take him beyound his patisandhi citta therefore he says that atta and loka arise by themselves

exertion mindfulness and right attentiveness the commentary explains atta as well as loka as one of the five khandhas the sub commentary expands this by saying that when the four mental khandhas are taken as atta by those who believe in atta soul the remaining khandha is taken as joka or ii when one of the five khandhas is taken as atta the rest of the khandhas are taken as loka or iii when all the five khandhas of oneself are takén as atta the khandhas outside oneself are taken as joka by those who believe in atta see appendix al silakkhandha vagga when his mind has thus gained the highest

through sabbafifiuta nana perfect wisdom anyone wishing to praise correctly the true virtues of the tathagata should do so in terms of these dhammas end of first portion for recitation bhana vara four views of eternity and non eternity ekacca sassata ditthi there are bhikkhus some samanas and brahmanas who holding the dualistic view of eternity and non eternity put in the wrong way see appendix feeling see appendix dhammas see footnote of para bhana vara means the portion of the test which can be recited at stretch by an average bhikkhus if the text is in the gatha form one bhana vara may roughly have two hundred and fifty stanzas if it is in the prose form it may roughly have eight thousand worlds silakkhandha vagga forward four reasons to show that atta as well as joka is in some cases eternal and in others not eternal on what authority and on what basis do these respected samanas and brahmanas holding ‘the dualistic view of eternity and non eternity put forward four resons to show that atta as well as joka is in some cases eternal and in others not eternal the first category of ekacca sassata difthi there indeed is such time bhikkhus as when this world system gets dissolved as it does at times after lapse of many aeons when the world system becomes thus dissolved beings are reborn mostly in the abhassara plane of existence of radiant brahmas when they are born there because of jhana mind they are nurtured by rapture resplendent with light from their own bodies sojourning in the heavens and living in splendour and they remain there for aeons there indeed is such time bhikkhus as when this world system rises again as it does at times after lapse of many aeons when the world system thus rises again there appears palatial brahma abode brahma vimdana one or all three of brahma realms of first jnana void of all life at that lime certain being from the abhassara plane of existence dies either at the end of his span of life or on the exhaustion of the stock of his meritorious deeds and is reborn in that empty palatial brahma realm when he is born there because of jhana mind he is nurtured by rapture resplendent with light from his own body sojourning in the heavens and living in splendour thus he remains there for aeons living there alone for aeons there arise in him mental weariness and longing for company thus “would that some other beings come to this place and then other beings abhassara the abhassara plane of existence to which brahmas of flashing radiance belong is the third of the three second jhana brahma realms in the thirty one planes of existence see appendix for the thirty one planes of existence brahmajala sutta from the abhassara plane of existence die either at the end of their span of life or on the exhaustion of the stock of their meritorious deeds and are reborn in that palatial brahma realm when they are born there because of jhana mind they are nurtured by rapture resplendent with light from their own bodies sojourning in the heavens and living in splendour thus they remain there tor acons then bhikkhus the being who was the first to be reborn there thinks to himself thus “i am the brahma the great brahma the con queror the unconquered the all seeing the subjector of all to his wishes the omnipotent the maker the creator the supreme the controller the one confirmed in the practice of jhana and father to all that have been and shall be have created these other beings why can say so can say so because awhile ago thought to myself would that some other beings come to this place as wished so other beings have appeared in this place and then other beings who appeared later think to themselves “this honourable personage is the brahma the great brahma the conqueror the unconquered the all seeing the subjector of all to his wishes the omnipo tent the maker the creator the supreme the controller the one confirmed in the practice of jhana and father to all that have been and shall be this honourable brahma has created us why can we say so we can say so because as we see he appeared in this place first whereas we appeared only after him among them dhikkhus the one who appeared first lives longer and is more beautiful and more powerful than the others those beings who appeared later have shorter life and are less beautiful and less powerful than the one who first appeared silakkhandha vagga then bhikkhus there arises this possibility being dies in the brahma plane of existence and is reborn in this human world and there he renounces the worldly life for the homeless life of recluse and having thus renounced the worldly life and become homeless recluse he achieves utmost mental concentration by dint of ardent steadfast perservering exertion mindfulness and right attentiveness having established his mind in highest concentration he can recollect that former existence of brahma but he cannot recollect beyond that he says thus “that honourable personage is the brahma the great brahma the conqueror the unconquered the all seeing the subjector of all to his wishes the omnipo tent the maker the creator the supreme the controller the one confirmed in the practice of jhana and father to all that have been and shall be that honourable brahma has created us he is permenent stable eternal immutable and as everlasting as all things eternal we who were created by the honourable brahma are impermanent changeable short lived and mortal thus have we come into this human world this bhikkhus is the first possibility it is based on this holding on to this that some samanas and brahmanas holding the dualistic view of eternity and non eternity propound that atta as well as joka is in some cases eternal and in others not etemal the second category of ekacca sassata difthi in the second category of ekacca sassata ditthi on what authority and on what basis do the respected samanas and brahmanas holding the dualistic view of eternity and non eternity propound that alta as well as joka is in some cases eternal and in others not eternal bhikkus there are devas known as khiddapadosikas who absorbed in merry making and pleasure seeking for long lime forget to take nutriment and through such forgetfulness die in that abode of the devas brahmajala sutta then bhikkhus there arises this possibility certain being dies in that world of devas and is reborn in this human world and there he renounces the worldly life for the homeless life of recluse and having thus renounced the worldly life and become homeless recluse he achieves utmost mental concentration by dint of ardent steadfast perservering exertion mindfulness and right attentiveness having established his mind in highest concentration he can recollect that former existence of deva but he cannot recollect beyond that he says thus “those honourable devas who are not khiddapadosikas are not absorbed in merry making and pleasure seeking for long time and as they are not absorbed in merry making and pleasure seeking for long time they do not forget to take nutriment and since they are not forgetful they do not die in that abode of the devas they remain permanent stable eternal immutable and as everlasting as all things eternal but we khiddapadosikas were absorbed in merry making and pleasure seeking for long time and because we were absorbed in merry making and plesure seeking for long time we forgot to take nutriment through such forgetfulness we died in that world of the devas we are impermanent changeable short lived and mortal thus have we come into this human world this bhikkhus is the second possibility it is based on this that some samanas and brahmanas holding the dualistic view of eternity and non eternity propound that atta as well as loka is in some cases eternal and in others not eternal the third category of ekacca sassata ditthi in the third category of ekacca sassata ditthi on what authority and on what basis do the respected samanas and brahmanas

manopadosikas who stare hard and long at one another with jealousy staring hard and long thus at one another they develop mutual hatred hecoming exhausted both physically and mentally they die in that

world is finite there are also samanas and brahmanas who hold that the world is infinite they put forward four grounds to support their respective views on what authority and on what basis do these respected samanas and brahmanas put forward four grounds to support their respective views the buddha achieved four maggas by means of four satipatthanas in this paragraph the buddha was refernng to vedananupassana satipatthana which is one of the four vedananupassana satipatthana requires one to be mindful of feeling whenever it appears before any train of thought takes place if he can do so steadfastly he will perceive the anicea dukkha anatta nature of the five khandhas this perception is conducive to the achievement of mag gas by means of vedananupassana saupatthana the bodhisatta perceived the impermanent oppressive soulless nature of vedana this perception was conducive to ins achievement of freedom from dukkha where there was absolute extincuion of kilesas defilements this paragraph is meant to disillusion those who believe “vedana leching to be atta brahmajala sutta the first antananta ditthi in this world bhikkhus certain samana or brahmana achieves utmost mental

not the other way and also don take it that it is otherwise bhikkhus this is the third possibility it is based on this reason that some samanas and brahmanas who are elusive evade questions put to them on any matter and speak in ambiguous terms the fourth amaravikkhepa difthi note thirty one bhimis according to buddhism there are thirty one bhimis bhimi means an abode where beings live bhim is sometimes translated as plane of existence or realm twenty brahma higher celestial bhumis artpa brahmas brahmas with mind and no body live in four arupa brahma bhumis ripa brahmas with mind and body live in fifteen rupa brahma bhimis asafifiasatta brahmas ripa brahmas with body and no mind live in the asajifiasatta brahma bhimi brahmas are superior to devas six deva celestial bhimis devas live in the six deva bhimis one manussa human bhimi human beings live in this manussa bhimi four apaya nether bhimis niraya beings in realms of continuous suffering tiracchana animals peta miserable and ever hungry beings asurakayas miserable and frightened beings live in these four bhimis ii four types of birth according to buddhism there are four types of birth ‘they are andaja oviparous jalabuja viviparous samsedaja moisturesprung opapatika fully fledged birth iii opapatika in the case of brahmdas devas asurakayas petas and nirayas as soon as patisandhi mind first mind of the new life takes place they unlike humans and animals attain full maturity they appear as fully fledged beings this kinds of birth is called opapatika birth unlike jalabujas opapatikas do not leave behind dead bodies when they die simultaneously with their death their bodies disappear the birth of beings in these thirty one bhimis takes place in accordance with their kammas kamma is the abbreviated term for deeds words and thoughts which one has done sopken and conceived iv bad kammas killing stealing satisfying one sensual desire by improper means committing adultery and taking intoxicants are improper means telling lies setting one against another using rough and abusive words indulging in unbeneficial talk covetousness anger having faith in worng beliefs these are bad kammas they can cause one to have rebirths in the four apaya bhimis good kammas charity and self control to refrain from doing and saying what is evil these are good kammas they can cause one to have rebirths in deva bhimis vi better kammas four rupa jhanas refined mental states of concentration which one will gain as result of practising samatha bhavana they are better kammas they can cause rebirths in ripa brahma bhimis vii best kammas four maggas and phalas which one will gain as result of practising vipassana bhavana they will enable one to perceive nibbana silakkhandha vagga endless rebirths extinction of rebirths will cause one to gain freedom from dukkha what is the fourth reason that causes respected samanas and brahmanas to be elusive to evade questions put to them on any matter and to speak in ambiguous terms in this world bhikkhus certain samana or brahamna is lacking in wisdom and is very bewildered he evades questions put to him on any matter and speaks in ambiguous terms in the following manner as he is lacking in wisdom and is very bewildered “if were asked ‘is there another world and if took it that there is should answer ‘there is another world’ but would not say this way nor that way nor the other way neither would say not this way not that way not the other way nor would say otherwise if were asked whether there is not another world eseeeeceeeeees whether there is and also is not another

this way nor that way nor the other way neither would say not this way not that way not the other way nor would say otherwise bhikkhus this is the fourth possibility it is based on this reason that some samanas and brahmanas who are elusive evade questions put to them on any matter and speak in ambipuous terms bhikkhus these are the four reasons that cause those samanas and brahmanas to be elusive to evade questions put to them on any matter and to speak ambiguously bhikkhus when any of the samanas and brahmanas who are elusive evade questions put to them on any matter all of them do so either for these four or any one of the four reasons and not for any other reason the tathagata knows as in paras and anyone wishing to praise correctly the true virtues of the tathagata should do so in terms of these dhammas two doctrines of non causality adhiccasamuppanna ada there are bhikkhus some samanas and brahmanas who holding the doctrine of non causality propound in two ways that atta as well as loka arises without cause on what authority and on what basis do those respected samanas and brahmanas propound in two ways that atta as well as loka arises without cause the first adhiccasamuppanna vada there are bhikkhus brahmas who are known as asafifiasatta beings devoid of safifia lit perception here the commentary says mind and mental concomitants are meant when these brahmds pass away from that realm they are silakkhandha vagga reborn in sensual existence with safind there is possibility that when being thus passes away from that realm he is reborn in this human world having been thus reborn he renounces the worldly life for the homeless life of recluse he then achieves utmost mental concentration by dint of ardent steadfast persevering exertion mindfulness and right attentiveness when he has thus established his mind in highest concentration he can recollect the arising of safifia birth linking consciousness in the present existence but cannot recollect beyoud that he says thus “atta as well as loka arises without cause why can say so can say so because formerly was not in existence but now actually exist although had not existed before bhikkhus this is the first possibility it is based on this that some samanas and brahmanas holding the doctrine of non causality propound that atta as well as loka arises without cause the second adhiccasamuppanna vada secondly bhikkhus on what authority and on what basis do the respected samanas and brahmanas holding the doctrine of non causality propound that atta as well as loka arises without causes in this would bhikkhus certain samanas and brahmanas is given to logic and investigation he uses various methods of reasoning conducts investigations and gives his views thus “atta as well as loka arises without cause this brikkhus is the second possibility it is based on this that some samanas and brahmanas holding the doctrine of non causality declare that atta as well as loka arises without cause bhikkhus those samanas and brahmanas who hold the doctrine of non causality demonstrate on these two grounds that atta as well as loka arises without cause when any of the samanas and brahmanas who hold the doctrine of non causality demonstrate that atta as well as loka arises without cause all of them do so on these two or one of the two brahmajala sutta grounds and on no other ground the tathagata knows as in paras anyone wishing to praise correctly the true virtues of the tathagata should do so in terms of these dhammas bhikkhus those samanas and brahmanas who speculate on the past and who adhere to views relating to it assert in these eighteen ways their many and varied wrong views about the past bhikkhus when any of those samanas and brahmanas who speculate on the past and adhere to views relating to it declare their many and varied wrong views about the past all of them do so in these eighteen or one of the eighteen different ways and in no other way wpa bhikkhus the tathagata knows the destination the next existence in which one holding these eighteen views would be reborn if these views are thus held on to if these views are thus grasped the tathagata knows these cighteen views he also knows the dhamma which surpasses them knowing that dhamma he does not view it in the wrong way since he does not view it in the wrong way he realizes by himself the extinction of defilements greed anger and ignorance of the four ariya truths bhikkhus since the tathagata rightly knows the arising of feeling vedana and its cause the cessation of felling and its cause its pleasantness its faults and freedom from attachment to it he becomes liberated without any clining he realizes nibbana thus bhikkhus these are the dhammas which are profound hard to see hard to comprehend tranquil noble surpassing logic subtle and intelligible only to the ariyas the tathagata has set them forth after realization of these dhammas by himself through sabbajifiuta nana perfect wisdom any one wishing to praise correctly the true virtues of the tathagata should do so in terms of these dhammas end of the second portion for recitation silakkhandha vagga forty four views relating to the future aparantanudif thi there are bhikkhus certain samanas and brahmanas who speculate on the future and adhere to beliefs relating to it they assert in forty four ways their many and

forty four ways sixteen kinds of belief in the existence of sanna after death uddhama ghatanika safifii vada ts there are bhikkhus certain samanas and brahmanas who believe in the existence of saffa

existence of atta with saffia after death demonstrate in sixteen ways the wo existence of atta with sanfa after death they declare that atta is corporeal it does not decay after death and il nas sanna “wssiciceeaercaccanadgindias this view is held by person who has attained rupa jhana and who takes as atta the purified mental image pafibhaga nimitta which is the object of his jhana conceniration this purified mental image is taken by him as having the nature of corporeality because of its similarity to the original kasina object of meditation or because it has the nature of changeability as it is small before being enlarged mentally and as it becomes safina lit perception in most cases it stands for mind and mental concomitants brahmajala sutta large when expanded mentally the jhana mind which is concentrated on this purified mental image is taken by this person to be safifia and thus he believes that the atta identified with the purified mental image has safifia however person who believes in atta and who has not attained any jhana just takes it through some sort of reasoning that atta is corporeal and has safifia both these two kinds of persons firmly believe that after death in the present existence atta is not subject to decay or disintegration and therefore is eternal or that afta is incorporeal it does not decay after death and unas sanne cides matias muece ead this view is held by one who has attained an arupa jhana and whose object of jhana concentration is some abstract thing such as akasa or space this abstract object of concentration is taken by him as atta such objects of jhana concentration being abstract do not have the nature of corporeality the arupa jhana mind concentrating on such an object is taken as safina thus this atta has safifd and is eternal or that atta is both corporeal and incorporeal this view held by person who first attains artiipa jhana and believes in the corporeality of atta through concentrating on the purified mental image of kkasina object then after progressing further in concentration when he attains an ariipa jhana he comes to believe also that the atta identified with the abstract object of ariipa jhana concentration is incorporeal or that atta is neither corporeal nor incorporeal this view is held by person who has not attained any jhdna and who has heard such silakkhandha vagga statement from others or who has thought it out on this own or that alla ts ginile ss ancceccdtniawe att this view is held by person who believes in the finiteness of the world loka as represented by the purified

gained the purfied mental image can be mentally enlarged and expanded either before or after jhdna in one of three ways with finite limits or endlessly that is without finite limits or with finite limits vertically and endlessly without finite limits horizontally here the person concerned has mentally enlarged the purified mental image pafibhaga nimitta within finite limits and he takes this enlarged and defined image itself as atta thus he says ‘atta is finite it does not decay after death and it has safina in para the person concerned was speculating about the past here the person concerned is speculating about the future the same applies to the next three persons or that afta infinite ccccsecsscsccesesssescecerssecssveees this view is held by person who has mentally expanded

limited safa oo eeeeeeeeeeeeeees this view is held by person who has attained jhana but who has not mentally enlarged the purified mental image of the kasina object which therefore appears to him to be small or limited his jhana sanna concentrates on this small or limited mental image as its object and he takes the jhana mind or safifia as atta and he concludes that atta has small or limited sana other persons believe that atta itself is as small as thumb or paddy seed or an atom and therefore atta has small or limited safna or that atta has unlimited sammay oo eeeeceeeeeeee this view is held by person whose jhana concentration has as its object the purified mental image which has been mentally enlarged or expanded by him and who therefore concludes that atta has very large or unlimited

power of sight sees those in the abodes of intense continuous suffering he therfore concludes that atta indeed has and will have suffering or that atta has both happiness and suffering this view is held by person who sees being in the human world experiencing both happiness and suffering or that atta has neither happines nor suffering it does not decay after death and it has safifia here neither happiness nor suffering means equanimity this view is held by person who through the divine power of sight sees the vehapphala brahmas who are given to abiding in the’ jhana of equanimity bhikkhus these are the sixteen ways in which those samanas and brahmanas who believe in the existence of safifia after death declare their believe in the existence of atta with safinia after death when any of

is no other kind of saffia apart from this saffiakkhandha this person takes it that there is no saffid after death or that atta is both corporeal and incorporeal this view is held by person who takes as atta all the aggregates of physical and mental phenomena including saffa and as this atta has wm no additional safifia apart from safinakkhandha silakkhandha vagga either before or after death he

my dear ambattha our vedas mention thirty two bodily marks of great man for great man possessiong these marks there are only two alternative destinies and no other if that great man is but householder he will become universal monarch who came to the throne by virtue of righteous conduct ruling righteously over the four islands continents bounded by the four occeans conquering all advarsaries establishing peace and stability in his territories possessing these seven precious treasures namely the wheel treasure the elephant treasure the horse «treasure the gem treasure the woma treasure the rich man treasure and the eldest son treasure besides he will have more than thousand sons who are valiant heroic and of many heroic in appearance able to conquer hosts of enemics he would be conquerer ruling his silakkhandha vagga realm to the extent of its ocean boundaries with rightcousness without the use of means of punishment in the form of sticks or weapons “were he to renounce hearth and home for the homeless life of bhikkhu he will be buddha worthy of special veneration perfectly self enlightened and able to remove the veil of human passions kilesa my dear ambajtha have not taught you all vedas and have you not learnt them all saying “very well you reverence ambaj tha rose from his seat and paying respect to brahmana pokkharasarti mounted chariot drawn by mare and went forth with retinue of young brahmanas to the icchanangala forest grove riding the distance as far as the chariot could take him he alighted from it and walked to the monastery at that time great number of bhikkhus were walking up and down in the open space then young ambattha approached them and enquired thus “revered sirs where will the venerable gotama be staying now we have come here to pay our respect to him then the bhikkhus thought this young ambattha comes of well known family and he is pupil of the prominent brahmana pokkharasati it may not be burden to the revered one to hold conversations with such man of good family so the bhikkhus said to youg ambattha ambattha go quietly to the monastery where you will find the door shut then enter the porch slowly give cough and tap the door the revered one will open the door for you then young ambattha went quictly to the monastery where there was closed door entered the porch slowly gave cough and tapped the door the bhagava opened the door for him ambattha entered and so did the other young men with him exchanging greeting with the bhagava saying memorablé words of felicitations and having done so they took their seats in suitable place battha sutta anes but young ambaftha said little here and little there somewhat memorable words of felicitations to the bhagava remaining seated while he himself paced up and down and likewise he said little here and little there somewhat memorable words of felicitations to the bhagavad remaining seated while he himself remaining standing then the revered one asked the young ambattha ambattha is this the way you say little here and little there somewhat memorable words of felicitations to your old and aged brahmins who are your teachers and teachers of your teachers as you do now walking about or standing up while remain seated first name calling as “ibbha” “no indeed gotama it is appropriate for brahmana to speak walking to brahmana who is walking to speak standing to brahmana who is standing to speak sitting to brahmana who is seated and to speak reclining to brahmana who is reclining but gotama with shavelings contemptible samanas men of low birth blacks and those born from the insteps of the brahma’ it is but fitting that should talk to them in the same way that now talk to you gotama ambattha you have come here on business one who has come with purpose should keep his mind well on it friends this young ambattha thinks himself well trained and well taught whereas he is in fact ill trained and ill taught there is no other reason than lack of good training regarding his rudeness when young ambaftha heard the bhagava say of him as ill trained and ill taught he became displeased and angry and in an effort to imprecate disparage and condemn the the brahmanas held the belief that they were born form the brahma mouth whereas those belonging to the ruling class were from his breast to the mercantile class were from his navel and to the working class were from his knees silakkhandha vagga bhagava he ‘said to himself “friends see how snub that gotama and he spoke to the bhagava thus “o’ gotama the sakyan race is arrogant “o gotama the sakyan race is rude “o gotama the sakyan race is short tempered gotama the sakyan race is loquacious the sakyans are of low birth they are of low birth and yet they do not honour the brahmanas neither do they esteem them neither do they venerate them neither do they revere them and neither do they worship them it is not proper and fitting for the sakyan race who is of low birth is of low birth not to honour the brahmanas not to esteem them not to venerate them not to revere them and not to worship them in this way young ambattha degraded the sakyan as men of low brth for the first time second name calling as “ibbha” ambattha how has the sakyans offended you gotama once had the occasion to go to kapilavatthu on certain business at the behest of brahmana pokkharasati then entered the assembly hall of the sakyans there many men of the sakyan race both kings and princes were seated on high seats in the hall tickling one another with their fingers laughing loudly and playing boisterously thought they were in fact laughing at me no one offered me any seat gotama it is not proper and not fitting that these sakyans of low birth do not honour esteem venerate revere and worship the brahmanas in this way young ambattha degraded the sener as men of low birth for the second time third name calling as “ibbha” ambattha even female tit can chirp as she pleases in her own nest ambaftha kappilavatthu is the home ground of the sakyans ambaftha young man you shou not get irritated by such trifling matter gotama there are four castes the ruling class the brahmanas the mercantile class and the working class ot the ambattha sutta four the ruling class the mercantile class and working class are indeed servants of the brahmanas gotamarlt is not proper and not fitting that these sakyans of low birth do not honour esteem venerate revere and worship the brahmanas in this way young ambattha degraded the sakyans as men of low birth for the third time the son of slave girl then it occurred to the bhagava thus this young ambattha degrades the sakyans severely by calling them as men of low birth it were better for me to enquire into his lineage then the bhagava asked young ambattha ambajtha what is your lineage gotama am kanhayana by lineage ambattha if the name and lineage on both sides of your mother and father are investigated in proper succession it will be discovered that you are the descendant of slave girl belonging to one of the sakyans whereas the sakyans are the descendants of master race ambattha the sakyans regard king okkaka as their ancestor ambattha what happened in the past is that king okkaka banished his elder sons okkamukha karakandu hatthinika and sinistra in order that he could instal as king the son of his most beloved queen the elder sons who were thus exiled went out and lived in big teak forest near lake on the slopes of the himalayas being apprehensive of losing purity of their line they consorted with their own sisters at one time ambattha king okkaka asked his ministers in attendance “ministers where can my sons be living now “your majesty said the ministers your sons are residing in big teak forest near lake on the slopes of the himalayas being apprehensive of losing the purtiy of their line they consort with their own sisters then ambattha king okkaka made this exultant utterance “able indeed my people are my sons most able indeed my people are my sons ambattha henceforth after his exultant utterance they became known as sakyans able okkdka is the foremost ancestor of the sakyans si lakkhandha vagga ‘“ambattha king okkaka had slave girl by the name of disa she gave birth to child who was named kanha kanha as soon as he was born spoke “mother wash me mother bathe me cleanse me of inpurities shall be of benefit to you ambattha just as nowadays people could recongnize demon pisaica when they see one in those days people could recognize demon when they saw one and called him kanha “this child’ they said “speaks as soon as it is born kanha is born saca is born originting from such words thus spoken the lineage of the kanhas come to be known as kanhayana that kanha is the foremost ancestor of the lineage of the kanhas thus ambattha if the name and lineage on both sides of your mother and fathre are investigated in proper succession it will be discovered that the sakyans are the descendants of master race whereas you are the descendant of slave girl of sakyan as this had been said the young man persent addressed the bhagava thus revered gotama please do not degrade ambattha so severely with words amputing him to be sslave girl son gotama young ambattha is of good birth he also comes of good family he also is knowledgable he also speaks pleasantly and he is also learned he is able to argue with revered gotama on this subject’ then the bhagava spoke to the young man thus if you consider that young ambattha is not of good birth not having come of good family unknowledgable not of pleasant speech unlearned and unable to argue with samana gotama on this subject “let young ambattha remain silent and it will be you and who are to discuss the matter but if you consider that young ambattha is of good birth having come of good family knowledgable of pleasant speech learned and able to argue with samana gotama on this subject you remain according to the commentary this subject here means the vedas ambattha sutta silent it will be young ambattha and who are to discuss the matter revered gotama young ambattha is of good birth he comes of good family he is knowledgable of pleasant speech and learned he will be able to argue with friend gotama on this subject we shall remain silent let young ambattha himself discuss the matter with the revered gotama then the bhagava asked young ambattha thus now ambattha there has arisen relevant question which you will have to answer even though you may not want to if you refuse to answer definitely or if you are evasive or if you remain silent or if you go away without answering your head will split into seven pieces right here now what have you to say to this ambattha what have you heard from the old and aged brahmanas who are your teachers and tacher of your teachers when did the lineage of kanha arise who is the foremost ancestor of the lineage of kanha when he was thus questioned young ambattha remained silent and for the second time the bhagava asked him now ambattha what have you to say to this what have you heard from the oid and aged brahmanas who are your teachers and teachers of your teachers when did the lineage of kanha arise who is the foremost ancestor of the lineage of kanha for the second time young ambattha remained silent then the bhagava said to young ambattha ‘“ambattha answer me forthwith it is not the time for you to remain silent whoever ambattha fails to answer the tathagata repeatedly for three times when resonable question is put to him will have his head split into seven pieces right there at that time sakka holder of the thunderbolt armed with burning blazing and glowing sledge hammer stood in the sky intending “i will split young ambattha head into seven pieces if he refuses to answer the bahagava who has asked reasonable question only the bahagava and young ambattha could see sakka holder of the thunderbolt silakkh andha vagga then young ambaftha very much terrified with hair bristling through fright seeking safety shelter and refuge in the person of the bhagavad sat closer to him and adressed him thus what did the venerable gotama say will the venerable gotama please say it again ambattha what have you to say to this what have you heard when your old and aged brahamanas who are your teachers and teachers of your teachers when did the lineage of kanha arise ‘who is the foremost ancestor of the lineage of kanha gotama have heard about them just as the revered gotama has told me the kanhas are descended from that slave gril pisaca she is foremost ancestor of the kanhas the lineage of ambattha when that had been said those young men accompanying ambattha spoke so loudly and boisterously that there was resounding noise “friends young ambattha is said to be of not good birth young ambattha is said not to have come from good family young ambattha is said to be the son of slave girl of sakyan and friends it has been said that the sakyans are the sons of the masters of young ambattha we have wrongly presumed that samana gotama who speaks according to the dhamma is to be upbraided then it occured to the bhagava thus “these young men are degrading young ambattha severly with the words imputing him to be slave girl son it will be well for me to save him from being thus degraded then the bhagavad spoke to those young men young men do not degrade the young ambattha severely with the words ‘descendant of slave girl’ that kanha was powertul hermit isi he retired to the southern country’ and ic country lying to the south of the river ganges ambattha sutta learnt the noble art of mantras returning from there he approached king okkaka and asked for the hand of his daughter maddaripi in marriage then king okkaka said “o my people how dare this kanha ask for the hand of my daughter maddariipi in marriage when he is only the son of my slave girl enraged and displeased he fixed his bow with an arrow but he could not let it fly nor could he take it off the string then young men the ministers in attendance begged the isi kanha saying “o good isi help our king out good isi help our king out the king shall be helped out said the isi but should he shoot his arrow downwards the earth in his kingdom would break up help our king out good isi and save the kingdom too the king shall be helped out and the kingdom also shall be saved but should he shoot his arrow upwords there will be drought in the kingdom for seven years help our king out good isi and save the kingdom too and let there be rain also the king shall be helped out and the kingdom also shall be saved and the rain shall come but let the king aim his arrow at his eldest son the prince shall remain unruffled and not single hair on his body would stand on end then young men the ministers said to king okkaka thus “it has been said that if king okkaka aims his arrow at his eldest son the prince the latter will remain unruffled not single hair on his body standing on end the king okkaka aimed his arrow at his eldest son the prince who remained unruffled not single hair on his body standing on end then king okkaka on being threatened by supreme punishment through the mantra became alarmed and frightened and suffered horripilation he then gave his daughter maddartpi to isi kanha that kanha was powerful hermit superiority of the khattiyas then the bhagava said to young ambattha what do you think of this ambaftha if in this world young man silakkhandha vagga of the family of khattiya ruling class marries brahmana maiden and begets son out of this wedlock is the son born of the union of the khattiya young men and the brahmana maiden entitled to get rightful place and water in the comunity of the brahmana yes gotama he would and would the brahmanas let him take food offered to brahmanas inhonour of the departed ones or at some other feast to honour auspicious occasions or to make sacrifices or to entertain guests yes gotama they would and would the brahmanas teach him vedas or not yes gotama they would and would the brahmanas forbid or not forbid him should he take brahmana maiden for wife gotama they would not forbid and would the khattiyas consecrate him as khanttiya gotama certainly they would not why not because he is not of royal descent on his mother side “what do you think of this ambattha if in this world young brahmana marries maiden of the family of khattiyas ruling class and begets son out of this wedlock is the son born of the union of the brahmana young man and the khattiya maiden entitled to get rightful es and water in the community of the brahmanas “yes gotama he would “and would the brahmanas let him take food offered to brahmanas in honour of the departed ones or at some other feast to honour auspicious occasions or to make sacrifices or to entertain guests “yes gotama they would “and would the brahmanas teach him vedas or not “yes gotama they would “and would the brahmanas forbid or not forbid him should he take brahmanas madien for wife “no gotama they would not forbid “and would the khattiyas conscecrate him as khattiya ambattha sutta “gotama certainly they would not because he is not of royal descent on his father side thus ambattha comparing women with women and men with men the khanttiyas are superior and the brahmanas are inferior what do you think of this ambattha if in this world for certain offence brahmana had his head shaved and sprinkled with ashes and was banished by the brahmanas from the country or town would he get his rightful place and water in thescommunity of the brahmanas “no gotama they would not “and would the brahmanas let him take food offered to brahmanas in honour of the departed ones or at some other feast to honour auspicious occasions or to make sacrifices or to entertain guests “no gotama they would not “and would the brahmanas teach him vedas or not “no gotama they would not and would the brahmanas forbid him or not forbid him should he take brahmani maiden for wife “yes gotama they would forbid “what do you think of this ambattha if in this world for certain offence khattiya had his head shaved and sprinkled with ashes and was banished by the khattiyha trom the country or town would he get his rightful place and water in the community of the brahmanas yes gotama he would and would the brahmanas let him take food offered to brahmanas in honour of departed ones or at some other feast to honour auspicious occasions or to make sacrifices or to entertain guests yes gotama they would and would the brahmana teach him vedas or not yes gotama they would and would the brahmanas forbid him or not forbid him should he take brahmani maiden for wite gotama they would not forbid sitlakkhandha vagga ambattha khattiya who has his head shaved and sprinkled with ashes and is banished form the country or town becomes degraded to the lowest status even when khattiya is thus degraded to the lowest status he still remains superior whilst the brahmanas are inferior ambattha sanankumara the brahma has uttered this stanza “eminent are the khattiyas among people who put reliance on their lineage but among devas and men he who is endowed with knowledge and practice of morality stands out as pre eminent ‘“well sung ambattha is the gatha by sanankumara the brahma it is not ill sung and well recited it is it is not ill recited it conduces to benifit and not otherwise agree with him ambattha and say this to you ‘eminent are the khattiyas among people who put reliaence on their lineage but among devas and men he who is endowed with knowledge and practice of morality stands out pre eminent end of the first portion for morality knowledge and practice of morality vijjacarana what gotama is that practice of morality carana and that knowledge vijja ‘“ambattha in the fullness of the incomparable knowledge and perfect practice of morality one should not speak of birth lineage and pride of birth etc thus “you are as worthy as i” or “you are not as worthy as i” ambattha in matters of marriages relating to acceptance of the bride into one family or giving away the bride to another family or to both customs ambattha sutta of acceptance and giving away one may speak of birth lineage and pride thus “you are as worthy as i” or “you are not as worthy as i” but ambattha those who are bound by notions of birth lineage or pride and of marriage customs relating to the acceptance or giving away of the bride will be far removed from perfection in incomparable knowledge and practice of morality ambattha those who are not bound by notions of birth lineage or pride and of marriage customs relating to acceptance or giving away of the bride will relize for themselves perfection in incomparable knowledge and practice of morality “what venerable gotama is that practice of morality carana and that knowledge vijja ambattha there appears in this world tathagata who is worthy of special veneration who truly comprehends all the dhammas by his own intellect and insight who possesses supreme knowledge and perfect practice of morality who speaks only what is beneficial and true who knows all the three lokas who is incomparable in taming those who deserve to be tamed who is the teacher of devas and men who is the enlightened one knowing and teaching the four ariya truths and who is the most exalted through perfect wisdom he personally realizes the nature of the universe with its devas madras and brahmas and also the world of human beings with its smanas and brahmanas king and men and knowing it by himself through sabbafifiuta fiana he expounds on it he proclaims the dhamma which is excellent at the beginning excellent at the middle and excellent at the end with richness in meaning and words he makes clear the completeness and purity of the noble practice brahmacariya householder or his son or anyone belonging to any caste listens to that dhamma on hearing the dhamma he develops faith in the tathagata when faith is thus develope he reflects in the following manner here read as in the sammfpnaphala sutta see para ii to para silakkhandha vagga “being detached from sensual pleasures and demeritorious factors that bhikkhu achieves and remains in the first jhana which is‘accompanied by vitakka initial application of the mind on its object vicdra sustined application of the mind and which has piti delighful satisfaction and sukha bliss born of detachment from the hindrances nivaranas this is the practice of morality of that bhikkhu and again ambattha having got rid of vitakka and vicdra the bhikkhu achieves and remains in the second jhana with internal tranquallity with enhancement of one pointedness of concentration devoid of vitakka and vicara but with piti and sukha born of contentration and this also is the practice of morality of that bhikkhu and again ambattha having been detached from piti too that bhikkhu dwells also in equanimity with mindfulness and clear comprehension only and experiences sukka in mind and body’ he achieves and remains in the third jhana that which causes person who attains it to be praised by the ariyas as one who has equanimity and mindfulness one who abides in sukha this is also the practice of morality of that bhikkhu badia and again ambattha by dispelling both pain and pleasure and by the previous disappearance of sadness and gladness that bhikkhu achieves and remains in the fourth jhana without pain and pleasure state of absolute purity of mindfulness due to equanimity this also is the practice of morality of that bhikkhu ambaftha these are four jhanas the practice of morality mentioned before when the concentrated mind becomes purified pellucid unblemished undefiled malleable pliable firm and imperturbable that bhikkhu directs and inclines his mind to insight knowledge this also is the knowledge of that bhikkhus he knows that for the purposes of the path he has nothing more to ‘in mind and body mind is included according to the commentary as in the samatitta sutta para to as in the samatitta sutta para to para ambattha sutta do and this also is the knowledge of that bhikkhu ambajftha these eight categories constitute knowledge mentioned before ambaftha this bhikkhu may be said to have become endowed with knowledge or endowed with practice of morality or endowed with both knowledge and practice of morality ambaftha there is no other endowment which can surpass or which is more noble than this endowment with knowledge and practice of morality decay of vijjacarana in four ways ambattha there are four ways by which endowment with incomparble knowledge and practice of morality vijjacarana is brought into decay and what are these four ambaftha in this world some samanas and brahmanas unable to be endowed with incomparable knowledge and practice of morality vijjacarana enter forest carrying the requisites of hermit with yokes on their shoulders vowing to themselves “i will practise living only on fruits that fall by themselves but in fact that person is only an attendant on one who is endowed with knowledge and practice of morality this ambattha firstly is the way by which endowment with incomparable knowledge and practice of morality is brought into decay and again ambattha here in this world some samanas and brahmanas unable to be endowed with incomparable knowledge and practice of morality and also being unable to practise living only on fruits that fall by themselve enter forest carrying with them hoes and baskets vowing to themselves will practise living on tubers roots and fruits “but in fact that person is only attendant on one who is endowed with incomparable knowledge and practice of morality this ambattha secondly is the way by which endowment with incomparable knowledge and paractice of morality is brought into decay and again ambattha in this world some samanas and brahmanas unable to be endowed with incomparable knowledge and practice of morality and also being unable to practise living only on fruits that fall by themselves and also being unable to practise living only on fruits that fall by themselves and also silakkhandha vapp being unable to practice living only on fruits that fall by themselves ‘and also being unable to practise living only on tubers roots and fruits set up building where sacrificial fire is kept near village or town and keep the fire always burning but in fact that person is only an attendant on one who is endowed with incomparable knowledge and practice of morality this ambattha thirdly is the way by which endowment with uncomparable khowledge and practice of morality is brought into decay and again ambattha in this world some samanas and brahmanas unable to be endowed with incomparable knowledge and practice of morality and also being unable to practise living only on fruits that fall by themselves and also being unable to practise living only on tubers roots and fruits and also being unable to become fire worshipper built house with four doors at the junction of four roads vowing to themselves “i will make offerings to the test of my ability to those samanas and brahmanas who come from tour directions “this ambattha fourthly is the way by which endowment with incomparable knowledge practice cf rorelity is brought into decay these nbattha are the four ways by which endowment with incomparable knowledge and practice of morality is brought into decay ambattha what do you think of this do ycu think that you together with your teacher are endowed with the incomparable knowledge and practice of morality no gotama what kind of men gotama are we my teacher and mysgll “vhat is that thing called endowrmoat with incomparable knowledy¢ and practice of morality gotama my teacher and myself are far irom beir endowed with incomparable vijjacarana knowledge and practice of morality ambattha what do you think about this since you and your teacher cannot be endowed with inco nparable know dge and practice of morality do you enter the forest carrying the requisites of sage with yokes on your shoulders vowing to yourselves we will practice living on fruits that fall by themselves’ ambattha sutta no gotama we do not “ambattha what de you think of this since you and your teacher cannot be endowed with incomparable vijjacarana knowledge and practice of morality and cannot practise living on fruits that fall by themselves do you enter the forest carrying with you hoes and baskets vowing to yourselves “we will practise living only on tubers roots and fruits’ “no gotama we do not” “ambattha what do you think of this since you and your teacher cannot be endowed with incomparable knowledge and practice of morality and also cannot practise living on fruits ihat fall by themselves nor practise living on tubers roots and fruits do you set up building where sacrificial fire is kept near the village or town keeping the fire always burning no gotama we do not “ambattha what do you think of this since you and your teacher cannot be endowed with incomparable knowledge and practice of morality and cannot practise living on fruits that fall by themselves and also cannot practise living on tubers roots and fruits and also cannot become fireworshipper always burning for worship do you build house with four doors at the junction of four roads vowing to yourselves “we will make offerings to the best of our ability to those samanas and brahmanas who come from the four directions no gotama we do not thus ambattha you and your teacher have fallen short of being endowed with incomparable vijjacarana knowledge and practice of morality and also fallen short of due training in the four ways that bring about decay in endowment with incomparable knowledge and practice of morality ambattha even though your teacher brahmana pokkharasati has fallen short of due training in the four ways that bring about decay in endowment with knowledge and practice of morality he said such words as who are those shavelings contemptible samanas men of low birth blacks and those born from insteps of the brahma what is the discussion with brahmanas skilled in the silakkhandha three vedas see ambajttha how serious is the wrong done by your teacher brahmana pokkharasati study of the hermits of ancient times “ambattha brahmana pokkharasati enjoys whatever king pasenadi kosala gave him but the king never allows the brahmana to see him face to face whenever brahmana pokkharasati talked face to face with king pasenadi kosala he overpowered the latter with his magic avattanimaya to obtain valuable objects without the willing consent of the owner as this was discovered the king had curtain drawn between him and the brahmana whenever he had to speak with him whenever he consults with the latter he speaks to him from behind curtain why ambattha is it that the king refuses to see face to face the brahmana who accepts what is granted lawfully see ambattha how serious is the wrong done by your teacher brahmana pokkharasati ambajftha what do you think of this here is this instance when king pasenadi kosala happens to discuss things with his distinguished ministers or princes either sitting on the neck of his elephant or on the back of his horse or on the foot rug of his chariot then he may leave the place of discussion and be seated elsewhere in suitable place suppose that working man or servant of working man should come up take the king place and give counsel saying “king pasenadi kosala said so king pasenadi kosala said so he might speak as the king might have spoken or might give counsil as the king might have given would he thereby be taken for the king or even his ministers “no gotama ambattha and there were certain former sages of the brahmins who were the makers of the veda hymns who handed down the veda hymns the brahmins of today chant intone recite and teach these ancient veda hymns exactly as ambattha sutta they were chanted intoned and composed recited and taught by those sages who are these ancient sages they are ambattha vamaka vamadeva vessamitta yamataggi angirasa bharadvaja vase tha kassapa and bhagu you may say together with my teacher have learnt those vedas but this is no reason for you to say that thereby you have become sage or one trainng to become sage ambattha what do you think about this what have you heard when old and aged teachers and the teachers of those teachers said among themselves there were certain former sages of brahmins who were the makers of the veda hymns who handed down the deva hymns the brahmins of today chant intone recite and reach these ancient veda hymns exactly as they were chanted intoned and composed recited and taught by the those sages who are these ancient sages they are atthaka vamaka vamadeva vessamitta yamataggi angirasa bharadvaja vasettha kassapa and bhagu have you heard that those sages like you and your teacher are now enjoying the pleasures of the five senses well washed well perfumed well groomed with hair and beard tnmmed wearing ruby earings and clad in white garments “no gotama have not ‘“ambattha what do you think of this “have you heard that those sages lived like you and your teacher are now living on cooked rice cleared of black grains cooked with cleansed meat with various soups and curries of meat no gotama have not have you heard that those sages enjoyed like you and your teacher are now enjoying the company of women wearing dresses with fringes and flounces round their waists no gotama have not have you heard that those sages went about like you and your teacher are now going about in chariots drawn by well groomed mares poking them with long goads “no gotama have not silakkhandha vagga have you heard that those sages like you and your teacher are now being guarded had their towns well fortified with moats dug around them and city gates well barred guarded by men well armed with long sword ‘so amba tha you and your teacher are no sage nor one training to become sage ambattha anyone who has doubt and perplexity about me can question me and can answer so that doubt and perplexity are dispelled revealing the two bodily marks then the bhagava left the monastery and went to the walk young ambattha also left the monastery and followed him to the walk as he was following him walking back and forth in the walk he examined the thirty two marks of great man he noticed almost all the thirty two marks in the body of the bhagava except the two not seeing them he became perplexed doubful wavering and unsure about the existence of the private part encased in sheath and the long and extensive tongue then the bhagava thought this young ambattha has noticed almost all the thirty two marks of great man except the two not seeing them he became perplexed doubtful wavering and unsure about the existence of the private part encased in sheath and the long and extensive tounge it were better that let him see the two bodily marks with the exercise of the supernormal psychic power then the bhagava exercised his psychic supernormal power and let the young ambattha see the private part encased in sheath and put out the tongue touching and stroking both the ears in turns as well as the nostrils in turns and also covering the entire forehead with it then it occurred to the young ambattha thus samana gotama is fully endowed with the thirty two marks of great man and not partially ambatths sutta then he said to the bhagava “o gotama we shall now leave we are busy we have many things to do ambattha now you know your time when to leave then voung ambattna left nding on the chariot drawn by me at that time brahmana pokkharasati had gone out from okkattha together with great retinue of brahmanas and put up at his garden waiting for the return of the young ambattha who had now arrived at the garden having travelled by chariot as far as it could go and getting down from it to walk then paying due respects he approached brahmana pokkharasati and took his seat in suitable place when the young ambaftha had taken his seat brahmana pokkharasati said my dear ambattha does the reputation that has spread far and wide about the venerable gotama agree with the true facts or not is the venerable gotama such as one as reputed “your reverence the reputation that has spread far and wide about the venerable gotama agrees with the true facts it is nct that it does not the venerable gotama is such one as reputed and net otherwise and he is fully endowed with the thirty two marks of great man and not partially “my dear ambattha have you spoken with the venerable gotama “yes your reverence have talk with samana gotama in little way “dear ambattha how have you had talk with samana gotama in little way ‘then the young ambattha related to brahmana pokkharasati all what had pased between him and the bhagava when this had been said brahmana pokkharasati spoke to the young ambaftha thus “oh remarkable indeed is our wise man remarkable indeed is our know al remarkable indeed is our expert in the three vedas friends such man who conducis in this way would certainly send his teacher to apaya abode of woe silakkhandha vagga duggati bad destination vinipata abode of ruin and niraya abode fo suffering after death and dissolution of his body “you ambajftha went on rebuking and rebuking the venerable gotama so the venerable gotama had our faults exposed again and again oh how remarkale is our ‘wise man’ how remarkable is our know all how remarkable is our expert in the three vedas friends such man who conducts himself in this way would certainly send his teacher to apaya abode of woe duggati bad destination vinipata abode of ruin and niraya abode of suffering after death and dissolution of his body angry and displeased brahmana pokkharasati kicked the young ambattha and rolled him over at that instant desire arose in him to go and see the venerable gotama himself pokkharasati approaches the buddha at that time the brahmanas told brahmana pokkharasati in this way “your reverence there is hardly any time for you to see the venerable gotama today reverend pokkharasati may go to the venerable gotama tomorrow then brahmana pokkharasati prepared both hard and soft food at his house put them on carts and set out from okkattha to the icchanangala forest grove carrying blazing torches he went by chariot as far as it could take him and alighting from it went on foot then he approached the bhagava and after the exchange of greetings saying memorable words of felicitations seated himself in suitable place having taken his seat brahmana pokkharasati addressed the bhagava thus gotama has our pupil young ambaftha been here “yes brahmana your pupil young ambattha has been here “and gotama did you have some conversation with him yes brahmana had some conversation with young ambajtha ambattha sutta what gotama was that conversation you had with young ambattha then the bhagava related to brahmana pokkharasati all about the conversation they had on being thus told about it brahmana pokkharasati said to the bhagava “o gotama young ambattha is foolish “may the revered gotama forgive him brahmana happiness be to ambattha the young brahmana then brahmana pokkharasati examined the thirty two marks of great man in the body of the bhagavad he was able to see almost all the thirty two marks of great man except the two not seeing them he became perplexed doubtful wavering and unsure about the existence of the private parts encased in sheath and the long and extensive tongue then the bhagava thought this brahmana pokkharasati could see almost all the thirty two marks of great man except the two not seeing them he became perplexed doubtful wavering and unsure about the existence of the private parts encased in sheath and the long and extensive tongue it were better if let him see the two bodily marks with the exercise of the supernormal psychic power then the bhagava exercised his supernormal psychic power and let only brahmana pokkharasati see the private parts encased in sheat and the extensive tongue touching and stroking both the ears in turns as well as both the nostrils in turns and also covering the entire forehead with it then it occurred to brahmana pokkharasati thus “samana gotama is fully endowed with the thirty two marks of great man and not partially then brahmana pokkharasati said “kindly accept my offering of the morning meal for today along with the bhikkhus belonging to the order the bhagava showed acceptance by remaining silent silakkh andha vagga the brahmana pokkharasati knew that his invitation had been accepted by the bhagavad and said “it is time venerable gotama the meal is ready then in that morning the bhagavad rearranged his robes suitably and carrying the bowl and the great robe went to the house of brahmana pokkharasati with retinue of the bhikkhus and arriving there took the seat prepared for him brahmana pokkharasati personally attended on the bhagava offering choice hard and sofi food with his own hands tll the bhagava caused him to stop signifying he had had enough young brahmanas also served the bhikkhus when the bhagava had finished his meal and withdrew his hand from the bowl brahmana pokkharasati took low seat and sat thereon the bhagava delivered series of discourses in sequene to brahmana pokkharasati who has seated at suitable place and what is it it is about charity morality celestial abodes the faults of sensual desires their vileness and their defilements and advantages of freedom from them when the bhagava came to know that the mind of brahmana pokkharasati had been rendered fit malleable free from hindrances exalted and clear he proclaimed the samukka msika which only the buddha could discover explaining the brahamana about dukkha suffering the origin of dukkha the cessation of dukkha and the path leading to the cessation of dukkha just as clean and unstained cloth readily takes the dye brahmana pokkharasati took in the truth and gained the eye of wisdom solapattimagganana which is free from defilments realizating then and there that whatever has the nature of arising has the nature of cessation pokkharasati becomes lay disciple at that time brahmana pokkharasati had himself seen the dhamma attained it gained insight into it plunged into it overcame doubt overcame vacillation and gained the courage ambattha sutta of conviction and not having faith in any other doctrine except the buddha he addressed the bhagava thus gotama excellent is the dhamma gotama excellent is the dhamma just as gotama one has turned up what lies upside down just as one has uncovered what lies covered just as one shows the way to another who is lost just as one holds up lamp in the darkness for those who have eyes to see visible objects even so have you revealed the dhamma to me in various ways venerable gotama together with my sons my daughters my wives my followers and my ministers take refuge in the buddha in the dhamma and in the sangha please take us as lay disciples from now on till the end of our lives “just as the venerable gotama visits the families of other lay disciples in okkattha even so let him visit the families of the lay disciples of the house holders of brahmana pokkharasati then all the young men and women there shall revere him welcome him give him seat and offer him water to drink and that will cultivate faith and condfidence in their minds it will be for benefit for long time to come ““brahmana well said replied the bhagava end of ambattha sutta the third in this vagga namo tassa bhagavato arahato sammasambuddhasgsa iv sonadanda sutta iv sonadanda

lost just as one holds up lamp in the darkness for those who have eyes to see visible objects even so has the revered gotama revealed the dhamma to me in various ways revered gotama take refuge in the revered gotama take refuge in the dhamma take refuge in the samgha please take me as lay disciple from now on till the end of my life furthermore please accept my offering of alms food tomorrow morning for revered gotama and the order consisting of bhikkhus the bhagavad showed assent by remaining silent then brahmana sonadanda knowing that the bhagava had accepted the invitation stood up from his place and left after doing obesance to him as night passed into day brahmana sonadanda pre pared the alms food both hard and soft and let it be known to the bhagava that it was ready saying “it is time gotama the meal is ready then in that morning the bhagava rearranging his robes taking the great robe and the alms bowl went to the house of brahmana sonadanda with retinue of the bhikkhus of the order took his seat in the prepared place together with the bhikkhus of the order then brahmana sonadanda personally attended on the bhagava offering choice hard and soft with his own hands till the bhagava caused him to stop signifying he had had enough when the bhagavad had finished his meal and withdrawn his hand from the bowl brahmana sondanda took silakkhandha vagga low seat and sat thereon having thus taken his seat brahmana sondanda ad dressed the bhagava thus “o gotama if get up and do obeisance to the revered gotama amidst this assembly stand to be humiliated by that assembly

happiness for many times to come please therefore instruct me for my prosperity and happiness for long time brahmana when this was said the brahmana purohita addresses king mahavijita thus ““your majestry the kingdom is being rankfed and hurt by the thorn of thievery plunder in villages suburbs and towns followed by highway robberies is very much in evidence “your majesty levying taxes in country rankled and hurt by the thorn of thievery would mean that you are doing what you should not do then therefore you might think ‘i must remove the thorn of thievery by the imposition of the

be pleased with one another and be happy letting their children frolick in their presence lit arms and would dwell in houses with open doors brahmana king mahavijita agreed and said to his brahmana purohita “very well friend and gave subsidies of seeds and grains to those devoted to farming and cattle breeding and offered aids in investment to those devoted to trading and made arrangements to give wages and food to those serving the king this done the subjects dedicating themselves to their respective occupations refrained from harrassi did not your kingdom then there was an increase in the portion of wealth and grains for the king when peace was established in the kingdom and as the thorn of thievery and victimization was removed the people were pleased with ohe another and were happy and as the thorn of thievery and victimization was removed the people were pleased with one another and became happy ‘letting their chil dren frolick in their presence ad dwelled in houses with

within the kingdom thus “brethren am desirous of holding great sacrificial feast that will bring prosperity and happiness for me for long time please give me your consent to this venture the khattiya vassals then told the king “do make the offering it is the suitable time your majesty there were ministers and officials in towns and countries within the kingdom there were brahmanas who were men of wealth in towns and countries within the kingdom there were katadanta sutta householders who were men of property in towns and coun tries within the kingdom the king consulated with them thus “brethren am desirous of holding great sacrificial feast that will bring prosperity and happiness for me for long time please give me your consent to this venture then they gave their consent saying “do make the offering it is the suitable time your majesty these four consenting parties thus constitute supporting factors to the sacrifice eight supporting factors king mahavijita was endowed with the following eight qualities he was well born on both sides of mother and father pure in line of ancestry going back to seven generations having never been ostracised nor reproached in respect of birth he is handsome good looking inspiring devotion endowed with an exceedingly beautiful apperance like brahma in complexion and gracefulness imposing in appearance he possesses accumulated wealth

is man of morality of steadfast morality and is endowed with steadfast morality he is wise talented and keen in intellect deserving to be the first or the second man to have the honour of holding the sacrificial ladle these qualities of the brahmana purohita also constitute the supporting factors to the performance of the sacrifice three mental attitudes then brahmana before the performance of the sacrifice the brahmana purohita instructed king mahavijita in the three mental attitudes toward sacrifice as your majesty is desiring to hold the great sacri ficial feast you might be having regrets saying “alas my immenses wealth will become depleted your majesty have no such regrets as you are holding the great sacrificial feast you might be regretting saying “alas my immense wealth is being kiutadanta sutta depleted your majesty have no such regrets having held the great sacrificial feast you might have regretted and said “alas my immense wealth has become depleted your majesty have no such regrets brahamna the brahmana purohita instructed king mahavijita in these three mental attitudes toward sacrifice before it was performed ten ways of preventing regret then brahmana before the performmance of the sacrifice the brahmana purohita in order to prevent any regret that might arise in ten ways in king mahavijita as regards donees said both who take life and who abstain from taking life will come to your sacrificial feast to those among them who take life there would come evil but to those abstaining from taking life your majesty will dedicate your offering give things away and feel glad about it with clarity of mind within both who take what is not given and who abstain from taking what is not given will come to your majesty sacrificial feast both who indulge in wrongful sexual conduct and who abstain from wrongful sexual conduct will come to your majesty sacrificial feast both who make false speech and who abstain from making false speech will come to your majesty

to your majesty sacrificial feast to those among them who entertain wrong views there would come evil but to those who entertain right views dedicate your offering giving things away and feel glad about it with clarity of mind within brahmana thus did the brahmana purohita say before the performance of the sacrifice to prevent regret that might arise in these ten ways in king mahavijita as regards the donees sixteen ways of gladdening the heart of the donor then brahmana the brahmana purohita instructed properly the king in his undertaking of the sacrifice he showed him the advantages of sacrifice persuaded him to take upon himself well the practice of alms giving encouraged him to be enthusiastic and gladdened his heart in the following sixteen ways your majesty as you are about to undertake the sacrifice someone might come forward and say “king mahavijita is holding sacrifical feast he did not consult the khattiya vassals in towns and countries within his kingdom and yet he

take upon himself the practice of alms giving encouraged him to be enthusiastic and gladdened his heart in these sixteen ways brahmana in this sacrificial offering no oxen were slain nor goats nor sheep nor fowls nor pigs nor any other living beings no trees were cut to be used as sacrificial posts no sacrificial grass was cut to be strewn about the sacrificial ground none of the king slaves

it willlingly while those not willing not doing it they did those duties they wanted to do but not those they did not want to do the feast ended with the offering of butter ghee edible oil milk curd honey and molasses then brahmana the khattiya vassals of towns and countrieg within the kingdom the ministers and officials of town and countries within the kingdom the brahmanas who silakkhandha vagga were wealthy men of towns and countries within the kingdom and the propertied householders of towns and countries within the kingdom approached king mahaavijita bringing their wealth with them and said “your majesty we have brought with us much of our wealth dedicated to you please accept them “my people the king said “enough do not want it have amassed wealth through lawful taxation and it has accumulated much let what you possess be yours if you want more take it from me when the king refused their offering they repaired to place and decided among themselves saying “it is improper for us to take back home our wealth king mahavijita is now making great offering of alms we shall also do so following his example then brahmana the khattiya vassals of towns and countries held great feast in the eastern wing of the sacrificial hall lying to the east the ministers and officials of towns and countries held great feast in the sacrificial hall lying to the south the brahmanas who were wealthy men of towns and countries held great feast in the sacrificial hall lying to the west while the propertied householders of towns and countries held great feast in the sacrificial hall

mahavijita the four qualities of the brahmana purohita and the three attitudes regarding the kutadanta sutta sacrifice brahmana these are the three mental attitudes and the sixteen supporting factors thai make the sacrifice complete when this was said by the bhagava there was great commotion among the brahmanas who shouted loud and long saying “how marvellous is the sacrifice how marvellously perfect is the sacrifice meanwhile brahmana kitadanata remained silent so the brahmanas said “but the revered brahmana kutadanta does not rejoice at the wholesome words of samana gotama which have been well said friends replied brahmana kutadanta it is not that do not rejoice at the wholesome words of samana gotama which have been weil said indeed anyone who fails to rejoice at the wholesome words well said by samana gotama will have his head severed of its own accord indeed friends have been just thinking “samana gotama did not say “thus have heard or ‘this it would have happened but he said ‘so it then was and ‘thus it happened ’” so friends have been thinking “at that time samana gotama ‘must have been king mahavijita himself or the brahmana purohita who instructed the king on the mode of sacrifice revered gotama do you recollect that after death and dissolution of your body you were reborn in the abode of devas either having yourself held great sacrificial feast or having yourself instructed how to hold great sacrificial feast brahmana replied the bhagava do recollect that after death and dissolution of my body was reborn in the abode of devas either having myself given great sacrificial feast or having myself instructed how to hold great sacrificial feast in fact was the brahmana purohita who instructed the king on how to hold great sacrificial feast

undertakes to observe the precepts one who strictly observes the precepts has given up attachemt to his own self and to his own life thus it amounts to supreme sacrifice normally taking refuge in the five precepts after being established in the three refuges is far nobler as in the samajfifiaphala sutta para to silakkhandha vagga brahmana the bhikkhu is thus accomplished in morality he attains the first jhana the sacrifice relatiing to the attainment of the first jhdna entails less trouble and exertion but proves more fruitful and rewarding than do the sacrifices previ ously cited he attains the second jhana he attains the third jhana p’ he attains the fourth jhana the sacrifice relating to the attainment of the fourth jhana entails less trouble and exertion but proves more fruitful and

knowledge of the extinction of dsavas en tails less trouble and exertion but proves more fruitful and rewarding than the sacrifices previously cited brahmana there is no other perfection in sacrifice which far excels or is more eminent than this perfection in sacrifice leading to the attainment of savekkhaya fana kifadanta requests for lay discipleship when this was said brahmana kdtadanta ad dressed the bhagava thus “excellent gotama is the dhamma excellent gotama is the dhamma just as one has turned up what lies upside down just as one has uncovered what lies covered just as one shows the way to another who is lost just as one lights up lamp in the darkness for those who have eyes to see as in the samafifiaphala sutta para to as in the samafifiaphala sutta para to as in the samafinaphala sutta para as in the samajfifiaphala sutta para to kutadanta sutta visible objects even so has the revered gotama revealed the dhamma to me in various ways revered gotama take refuge in the revered gotama take refuge in the dhamma take refuge in the samgha please take me as lay disciple from now on till the end of my life now set free revered gotama those seven hundred bulls seven hundred oxen seven hundred cows seven hundred heifers seven hundred goats and seven hundred sheep brought to the sacrifical post give them life let them eat the lush green grass let them drink cool water let cool winds blow over their bodies realization of the fruits of sotapatti then the bhagava delivered series of discourses in their sequence and what is it ay it is about alms giving morality celestial abodes faults of sensual desires of the vileness of sensual desires defiling effect of the sensual desires and the advantage of renunciation when the bhagava came to know that the mind of brahmana kitadanta has been rendered fit supple free from hindrances exalted and clear he proclaimed the samukkamsika dhamma which buddhas only could discover explaining him about dukkha suffering the cause of dukkha the cessation of dukkha and the path leading to the cessation of dukkha just as clean and stainless cloth readily takes the dye even so brahmana kitadanta took in the truth and gained the eye of wisdom sotapatti magga fiana which is free from impurities and defilements realizing then and there that whatever has the nature of arising has the nature of cessation then the brahmana kitadanta having himself seen the dhamma reached it gained insight into it plunged into it overcame doubt overcame vacillation and gained the course of conviction and did not have faith in any other doctrine except the buddha he addressed the bhagavad thus “will the revered gotama with his company of bhikkhus of the order accept my invitation to tomorrow alms meal the silakkhandha vagga bhagava signified assent by remaining silent then the brahmana kitadanta knowing that the bhagava had accepted the invitation stood up from his place and left after doing obesance to him as night passed into day brahmana kitadanta prepared the alms food at the hall for donation both hard and soft informed the bhagavad that it was ready by saying “it is time revered gotama the meal is ready then in the morning the bhagava wearing his robes and taking the great robe and alms bowl went to the hall for donation of brahmana kitadanta and took his seat in the prepared place together with the bhikkhus of the order then the brahamana kitadanta personally attended on the bhagava offering hard and soft food with his own hands till the bhagava caused him to stop signifying he had had enough when the bhagava had finished his meal and withdrawn his hand from the bowl he instructed brahmana kutadanta now sitting in low seat on the advantages accruing from the dhamma and made him established in it eager and delighted in the practice of it then the bhagava rose from his seat and left the place end of kutadanta sutta the fifth in this vagga namo tassa bhagavato arahato sammasambuddhasgsa vi mahali sutta vi mahali sutta the story of the brahmana messengers thus have heard once the bhagava was residing in the pinnacled monastery in great forest near vesali at that time brahmin messengers of magadha and kosala were putting up at vesali on business then the various brahmin messengers of magadha and kosala heard this news “indeed friends samana gotama son of the sakyan king who left the family of sakyans to become bhikkhu is now residing in the pinnacled monastery near vesali the fame of the venerable gotama has spread far and wide it has been said of him thus that bhagava is worthy of special veneration who truly comprehends all dhammas by his own intellect and insight who possesses supreme knowledge and perfect practice of morality who speaks only what is beneficial and true who knows all the three lokas worlds who is incomparable in taming those who deserve to be tamed who is the teacher of devas and men who is the enlightened one knowing and teaching the four ariys truths and who is the most exalted through perfect wisdom he personally relizes the nature of the universe with its devas madras and brahmas and also the world of human beings with its samanas brahmafias kings and men and knowing it he expounds on it he proclaims the dhamma which is excellent at the beinging excellent at the middle and excellent at the end with richness in meaning and words revealing the completeness and purity of the noble practice brahmacariya it behoves us to see such person worthy of veneration then the brahmin messengers of magadha and kosala approached the pinnacled monastery in the great forest at that time the venerable nagita was waiting on the bhagava then the brahmin messengers of magadha and kosala approached him and said silakkhandha vagga “revered nagita where is the venerable gotama residing we would like to sea him then nagita said “friends this is not the time to see the bhagavad he has retired in seclusion” the brahmina messengers of magadha and kosala thought to themselves “we shall go only after seeing the venerable gotama and they sat in suitable place there the story of otthaddha licchavi otthadda licchavi king also came to the pinnacled monastery in the great forest with large company of licchavis and approaching the revered nagita and making obeisance to him said “venerable nagita where is the bhagava worthy of veneration and the perfectly self enlightened residing wish to see the bhagava who is worthy of special veneration and the perfectly self enlightened one” “mahali said nagita “it is not the time to see the bhagava he has retired in seclusion but otthaddha lacchavi king thought to himself “i shall go only after seeing the bhagava who is worthy of special veneration and the perfectly self enlightened one and sat in suitable place there then siha novice having approached the venerable nagita and paid due respects to him stood at place and said “venerable kassapa large number of brahmin messengers of magadha and kosala have arrived here to see the bhagava so did otthaddha licchavi king together with large company of the men of licchavi venerable kassapa beg of you may these men have chance to see the bhagava “if that be so siha go and inform the bhagava about it yourself’ said nagita saying “very well venerable sir siha approached the bhagavad made his obeisance and standing at suitable place said mahali is the personal name of otthaddha kassapa is the family name of nagita mahal sutta “many of the brahmin messengers from magadha and kosala have come to this place to see the bhagava otthaddha licchavi king with large company of licchavis have also arrived to see the bhagava if that be so siha prepare seats under the shade of the monastery beg of you may these men have said the bhagava saying “very well venerable sir siha prepared seats under the shade of the monastery then the bhagava came out from the monastery and took his seat prepared for him under the shade of the monastery then the brahmin messengers of magadha and kosala approached the bhagava saying memorable words of felicitations and sat down in suitable place then ofthaddha licchavi king also accompanied by large company of licchavis approached the bhagava and having paid respect to the bhagava sat in suitable place having seated himself otthaddha licchavi king spoke to the bhagava thus “yesterday as well as the day before yesterday licchavi prince approached me and having approached said mahali had not been long with the bhagava it was just three years during that time have seen visible objects belonging to the deva world which are alluring accompanied by sensual attachment and enticing “venerable sir does sunakkhatta licchavi prince not hear the sounds belonging to the deva world which are alluring accompanied by sensual attachment and enticing because they are non existent or does he not hear them although they exist one sided concentration ‘“mahali said the bhagava “‘sunakkhatta licchavi prince does not hear sounds belonging to the deva world which are alluring accompanied by sensual attachment and enticing in silakkhandha vagga what is the cause ‘for it mahali it is due to the fact that that bhikkhu looking east cultivates concentration only for single attainment of hearing sounds in the east belonging to the deva world which are alluring accompanied by sensual attachment and enticing but does not cultivate concentration for single attachment of seeing visible objects and again mahali suppose bhikkhu in the south in the west in the north above or below or across cultivates concentration only for single attainment of hearing sounds belonging to the deva world which are alluring accompanied by sensual attachment and enticing but does not cullivate concentration only for single attainment of seeing visible objects belonging to the deva world which are alluring accompanied by sensual attachment and enticing since that bhikkhu cultivates concentration only for single attainment of hearing sounds lying above or below or across belonging to the deva world which are alluring accompanied by sensual attachment and enticing but does not cultivate concentration only for single attainment of secing visible objects lying above or below or across belonging to the deva world which are alluring accompanied by sensual attachment and enticing but does not see visible objects belonging to the deva world which are alluring accompanied by sensual attachment and enticing what is the cause for it the reason mahali is due to the fact that that bhikkhu cultivates concentration for single attachment of hearing sounds lying above or below or across belonging to the deva world which are alluring accompanied by sensual attachment and enticing but does not cultivate concentration for single attainment of seeing visible objects belonging to the deva world which are alluring accompanied by sensual attachment and enticing here in this teaching mahali bhikkhu cultivates concentration for the dual attainment of seeing visible objects as well as hearing sounds in the cast belonging to the deva world which are alluring accompanicd by sensual attachment and enticing since that bhikkhu cultivates the dual attainment of ali sutta maha seeing visible objects as well as hearing sounds in the east belonging to the deva world which are alluring accompanied by sensual attachment and enticing he sees not only visible objects but also hears sounds in the east belonging to the deva world which are alluring accompanied by sensual attachment and enticing “what is the cause for it the reason mahali is due to the fact that that bhikkhu cultivates concentration for the duel attainment of seeing visible objects as well as hearing sounds in the east belonging to the deva world which are alluring accompanied by sensual attachment and enticing “and again mahali bhikkhu looking south pp in the west in the north above or below or across cultivates concentration for the dual attainment of seeing visible objects as well as hearing sounds belonging to the deva world which are alluring accompanied by sensual attachment and enticing since that bhikkhu cultivates concentration for the dual attainrznt of seeing visible objects as well as hearing sounds lying above or below or across belonging to the deva wold which are alluring accompanied by sensual attachment and enticing he sees not only visible objects but also hears sounds lying above below or across belonging to the deva world which are alluring accompanied by sensual aitachment and enticing “what is the cause for it the reason mahali is due to the fact that that bhikkhu cultivates concentration for the dual attainment of seeing visible objects as well as hearing sounds lying above or below or across belonging to the deva world which are alluring accompanied by sensual attachment and enticing “mahali this is the cause this the condition why sunakkhatta son of licchavi prince does not hear sounds belonging to the deva world which are alluring accompanied by sensual attachment and enticing although they are existent it is not that he does not hear because they are non existent ‘venerable sir questioned mahali “‘is it perhaps that bhikkhu takes up the noble practice brahmacariya under silak ilakkhandha vagga the guidance of the bhagava for the realization of cultivated concentration “mahali” answered the bhagava “bhikkhus do not take up the noble practice for the realization of such concentration morality there are other dhamma which are more pleasing and higher than it bhikkhus take up the noble practice with view to their realization four ariya fruitions “venerable sir if the bhikkhu takes up the noble practice under the bhagava with view to the realization of such dhammas which are more pleasing and higher what are those dhammas mahili “in this teaching bhikkhu attains to the state of sotapanna stream winner through the complete destruction of the three lower fetters he is not liable to fall into realms of misery and suffering and is assured of good destination and of attaining the three higher levels of insight culminating in enlightenment mahali that state of stream winner is more pleasing and higher than concentration and mahali bhikkhus take up the noble practice with view to the realization of that state “and again mahali bhikkhu attains to the state of sakadagami once returner through the complete destruction of lower fetters and lessening of attachment hatred and bewilderment he will make an end of dukkha after returning to this realm of human being only once and bhikkhus take up the noble practice under my guidance with view to the realization of that state which is more pleasing and higher “and again mahali bhikkhu attains to the state of anagami never returner he has totally destroyed the five fetters that lead to rebirth in the lower planes of sensual ditthi wrong views silabbataparamasa wrong eligious practice and vicikiccha doubt add kamaraga attachment to sensual pleasure and patigha hered to the three fetters cited above mahali sutta pee existences he will have spontaneous rebirth in the abode of the brahmas and not being liable to return from that realm realizes parinibbana there this state of never returner mahali is more pleasing and higher and bhikkhus take up the noble practice with view to the realization of that state and again mahali bhikkhu becomes an arahat by means of abififia special apperception porsonally and in this very life realizes attains to and remains in the emancipation of mind cetovimutti and in the emancipation by ‘insight pafifiavinmutti free of asavas though their extinction this state of arahatship is more pleasing and higher and mah li bhikkhus take up the noble practice with view to the realization of that state mahfali it is thus indeed that bhikkhus take up the noble practice under my guidance with view to the realization of the dhammas which are moe pleasing and higher the ariya path of eight constituents “venerable sir is there any path and any training by which those dhammas can be realized “yes mahali there is the path and the training by which those dhammas can be realized” “venerable sir what then is the path and the training by which these dhammas can be realized “mahali here is this ariya path of eight constituents its constituents are right view right thinking right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration “this mahali is the path and the training by which those dhammas can be realized cetovimutti arahataphala samadhi concentration of mind free of all defileménts pertaining to the fourth stage of fruition pannavimutti arahattaa phala

viii mahasihanada sutta vi mahasihanada sutta kassapa the naked ascetic thus have heard once the bhagava was residing in the deer park of kannakathala at urufifia town then kassapa the naked ascetic approached the bhagava exchanged friendly greetings with him saying memorable words of felicitations and standing respect fully at suitable place adressed the bhagava thus “oq gotama have heard it said “samana gotama disparages all kinds of self mortification reviling and condemn ing one sidely all ascetics who lead an austere life were they who said “samana gotama disparages all kinds of self mortifi cation reviling and condemning one sidely all ascetics who lead an austere life “saying it as samana gotama said is it that they were not making false charges against samana gotama is it what they state in conformity with what the samana gotama has expounded will there not be legitimate cause for censure however little in what samana gotama allegedly says we on our part have no intention to make any accusations against the revered gotama kassapa those who said “samana gotama dis parages all kinds of self mertification reviling and condemning one sidedly all ascetics who lead an austere life’ were not saying what said they were slandering me with what was not said and what is not true in this world kassapa see with my divine power of sight which is extermely clear surpassing the sight of men dibbacakkhu see that some who practise self mortification leading an austere life after death and dissolution of their bodies reappeared in wretched destinations duggati in miserable

also see with my extraordinarily keen vision beyond what human eyes can see as if seeing with the deva eye dibbacakkhu that other who practise the easy and less troublesome way to self mortification are reborn in the abode of happiness as divine beings on the dissolution of the body after death kassapa having known as they really are the comings from past existenes and goings to past existences the deaths and the arisings of those ascetics who practise self mortification why should disparage all self mortifications and revile and condemn one sidely all those who lead an auster life kassapa there are some samana and brahmanas who are learned intelligent skilled in rival dictrines and able to split hairs in arguments they conduct themselves as though they were smashing all wrong views by their knowledge ability in some instances their views are identical with mine but in others they are not in some instances where those samanas and brahmanas say “it is good we also say “good and where they say “it is not good we also say “not good in other instances where they say “it is not good” we say “good in some instances where we say “it is good others also say “good and where we say “it is

the naked ascetic addressed the bhagava thus “hard is the task of samana gotama hard is the task of brahmana kassapa common saying in this world is this “hard is the task of samana hard is the task of brahmana “but if this hardness his great hardness of the task is imputed merely to the ascetic practice such as going naked urinating or defecating in standing posture wiping the stool clean with the hand thus does he dwell in the practice of taking food at long intervals of up to once every half month it would not be fitting to say “hard is the task of samana hard is the task of brahmana as

morality concentration and knowledge when the bhagava thus ‘spoken kassapa the naked ascetic asked him “what then friend gotama is perfec tion in morality perfection in concentration and perfection in knowledge kassapa there arises in this world the tathagata who is worthy of special veneration perfectly self enlightened he sees dangers even in the slightest of offences he well silakkhandha vagga observes the precepts he has taken upon himself he is en dowed with merits acquired both in deeds and in words he leads life of pupity being accomplished in morality he gurads all doors of the scenses practises self restraint being en dowed with mindfulness and comprehension and he remains contented how kassapa does bhikkhu become endowed with morality in this world kassapa bhikkhu abandons all thoughts of taking life and abstains from destruction of life setting aside the stick and sword ashamed to do evil and he is compassion ate and dwells with living beings such is his perfection in morality then there are certain respected samana and brahmanas who living on the food offered out of conviction in kamma and its results make wrongful living by means of low arts contrary to correct living conducive to the attainment of deva ralms and nibbana and what are such low arts they are propitiating the devas with offerings making offerings to the devas for favours granted dressing sores and removing the dressing the bhikkhus abstains from making wrongful living by means of low arts contrary to correct living conducive to the attainment of deva ralms and nibbana this also is that bhikkhus perfection in morality kassapa bhikkhu thus endowed with morality on account of his practice of morality encounters no danger in any way just as sovereign duly anointed and installed as king after having defeated his ememies can encounter no danger whatso ever from enemies so also bhikkhu thus indowed with morality on account of his practice of morality encounters no danger in any way possessing this noble group of moral precepts enjoys within himself happiness that is free trom blame this kassapa also is the bhikkhu perfection in moral ity that bhikkhu achieves and remains in the first jhana thus does the bhikkhu become endowed with concentration the bhikkhu achieves and remains in the second jhana the mahasihanada sutta third jhana the fourth jhana thus does the bhikkhu become endowed with concentration this kassapa is the bhikkhu perfection on concentration then kassapa when his concentrated mind becomes purified that bhikkhu directs and inclines his mind to insight knowledge vipassananana thus does he become en dowed with knowledge kassapa this also is the bhikkhu perfection in endowment of knowledge that he has nothing more to do for such realization thus does he become en dowed with knowledge kassapa also is the bhikkhu perfecton in knowledge kassapa there is no other endowment of morality con centration and knowledge which is more pleasant and higher than this perfection in morality perfection in concentration and perfection in knowledge the lion roar or bold declaration there are kassapa some samanas and brahmanas who extol in morality they speak in praise of morality in many ways but kassapa so far as there is the pure and noble form of morality do not see anyone who is equal to myself as regards morality much less superior indeed go further in morality adhisila there are kassapa some samanas and brahmans who extol ascetic practice as abnegation of evil they speak in praise of pure and noble intense of ascetic practice as abnegation of evil in many ways but kassapa so far as there is the pure and noble form of ascetic practice as abnegation of evil do not see anyone who is equal to myself much less superior indeed go further in higher ascetic practice adhijeguccha there are kassapa some samanas and brahmanas who extol in knowledge they speak in praise of knowledge in many ways but kassapa so far as there is the pure and noble torm

emancipation from defilements they speak in praise of emancipation from defilements is many ways but kassapa so far as there is the pure and noble form of emancipation do not see anyone who is equal

faiths might say samana gotama says brave words like the lion roar but he says them in an empty place not in the midst of an assembly in that event kassapa you should say to them thus “say not so and assert samana gotama utters brave words like the lion roar and does so in public and then kassapa it may well be that wandering ascelics of other faiths might say of samana gotama says brave words like the lions roar and he does utter them in public but not without fear that he does so in that event kassapa you should say to them thus “say not so and assert “samana gotama says brave words utters like the lion roar and he does so in public bravely and then kassapa it may well be that wandering ascetics of other faiths might say samana gotama says brave words like the lion roar and he does utter them in public bravely but men put no questions to him “men put question to him but when questioned he makes no answer “he does answer questions asked but he cannot win over the heart of

asked he does win over the heart of the question with his exposition men do hold that his words are worthy to be listened to men are inspired with devotion on hearing his words men express their devotion to him men practise what he preaches and mens satisfy him with their conduct probationary period for converts from other faiths kassapa was once staying at rajagha on the gijjhakuta hill where nigrodha one who takes up the noble ascetic practice asked me questions about the higher ascetic practice of abnegation of evil adhijeguccha replied to him about the higher ascetic practice as abnegation of evil when did so he over joyed venerable sir said nigrodha who would not be over joyed on hearing the dhamma preached by the bhagava too was overjoyed when heard the bhagava teach ing most excellent venerable sir continued nigrodha most excellent is the dhamma venerable sir just as one has turned up what lies upside down just as one has uncovered what lies covered just as one shows the way to another who is lost just as one holds up lamp in the darkness for those who have eyes to see visible objects even so has the venerabie one revealed the dhamma to me in various ways venerable sir take refuge in the bhagavad take refuge in the dhamma take refuge in the bhikkhus samgha may receive in the presence of the bhagava initation and full admission into the order as bhikkhu whoever kassapa having formerly been an ad herent of other faiths wishes to receive initiation and full silakkhandha vagga admission as bhikkhu in this teaching he is put on probation for four months and when the probationary period of four months is over and the bhikkhus are satisfied with him they will give him initiation and admission into the order but in the present case recognise the existence of differences among individuals venerable sir said kassapa if former adherent of other faiths wishng initiation and full admission as bhikkhu into the order in this teaching is to be put into probation for four months and if he were to be initiated and admitted into the order after the probationary period of four months for my part shall live under probation even for four years and at the end of these four years when the bhikkhus are satisfied with me please give me initiation and admission into the order then kassapa the naked ascetic received initiation and was admitted into the order in the presence of the bhagava not long after the venerabie kassapa remaining alone and in seclusion vigilant and zealous inclined his mind to nibbana and soon by realizing himself in this very life through magga insight abhififia he attained to and abided in the fruit of the noblest and supreme arahatship which is the ultimate goal of the noble practice and for which worthy men rightly renounce hearth and home to lead the homeless life he knew well “rebirth is ended the practice of purity has been accom plished what needed to be done for the attainment of magga insight has been done there is nothing more to do for such realization and so the venerable kassapa became one among the arahats end of mahasihanada sutta the eighth in this vagga namo tassa bhagavato arahato sammasambuddhassa ix po tthapada sutta ix potthapada sutta discourse on pofthapada the wandering ascetic thus have heard once the bhagava was staying at the monastery of anathapindika in jeta park at savatthi at that time potthapada the wandering ascetic with following of three thousand wandering ascetics was dwelling at the bkasadlaka hall where various views were debated in queen mallika garden bordered by tinduka persimmon trees then the bhagavad having rearranged his robes and taking alms bowl and robe set out early in the morning for savatthi on his daily round for alms and the bhagava thought “it is too early to go round for alms in savatthi should go to the ekasdlaka hall where various views are debated in queen mallika garden bordered by tinduka trees and meet potthapada the wandering ascetic then the bhagava visited the ekasalaka hall where various views were debated in queen mallika garden bordered by tinduka trees at that time potthapada the wandering ascetic was seated with his followers who were talking loudly and vociferously on unprofitable subjects not conducive to moral conduct leading to the attainment of the deva world and nibbana such kinds of talk are talk about kings thieves ministers armed forces calamities battles food drinks clothing beds flowers unguents relatives vehicles villages market towns cities provinces womenfolk heroes streets water fronts the dead and the departed trivialities the universe the oceans prosperity adversity and so on when potthapada the wandering ascetic caught sight of the bhagava approaching in the distance he called his followers to order saying “friends remain quiet and make no silakkhandha vagga noise here comes samana gotama that venerable one appreciates silence praising its virtues perhaps he may think it fit to approach us if he knows that it is quiet assembly ”’ when thus called to order the ascetics kept silent then the bhagava approached potthapada the wandering ascetic who addressed him thus “be pleased to come venerable sir venerable sir your coming is good you have taken quite long time to visit us here here is seat duly prepared venerable sir please take the seat and the bhagava took the prepared seat while potthapada the wandering ascetic took low seat at suitable place the bhagava said to him “potthapada what was the subject of your discussion as you were seated together here what was the nature of the talk that has been interrupted aw cessation of sanfia when the bhagava had thus spoken pofthapada the wandering ascetic addressed him thus “venerable sir let us put aside what we have been discussing in our assembly venerable sir it will not be difficult for the bhagava to hear about it afterwards but venerable sir on many previous day when samanas and brahmanas holding diverse views assembled here in this hall eager to listen to fresh views the talk arose on the subject of cessation of safifa and it was asked ‘how is the cessation of sanna brought about “some of them said ‘forms of safifia arise in being without reason without cause just as they cease without reason without cause when forms of saffd arise there is safina and when they cease there is no sanna sanfia lit perception the commentary says that ‘cessation of safifia’ is to be taken as cessation of citta mind or consciousness potthapada sutta re “thus did they explain the cessation of safifid to him another said ‘it will not be as you say friend safifia is the atta of being that safifia goes into and leaves being when it goes into being there is saffia when it leaves being there is no saffa ‘thus did they explain the cessation of sanfa to him still another said ‘it will not be as you say friend there are samanas and brahmanas who possess psychic potency and power and who can implant safna in that being or draw it out when implanted there is saffa and when drawn out there is no sanna “thus did they explain the cessation of safifa to him still another said ‘friend it will not be as you say there are mighty and powerful devas who can implant saffd in that being or draw it out when implanted there is sana and when drawn out there is no sanfa “thus did they explain the cessation of saffa “when venerable sir heard such words my mind turned towards the bhagava himself and thought “would that the bhagava were here would that the sugata were here he is highly accomplished in such dhammas venerable sir the bhagava is well versed in the subject of the cessation of sanna the bhagava knows the nature of the cessation of safna venerable sir how does the cessation of safinad happen existence of cause in the arising and cessation of sanna potthapada among those there arc samanas and brahmanas who maintain forms of safifa in being arise and cease without reason without cause their assertion is wrong from the very beginning for potthapada it is through reason and cause that forms of safina sugata he who speaks only true and beneficial words silakkhandha vagga in being arise and cease certain form of safina arises through practice’ and certain form of safifid ceases through practice ‘and what is that practice asked the bhagava of himself herein potthapada there arises in this world the tathagata who is worthy of special veneration who truly comprehends all dhammas by his own intellect and insight repeat as in paras to samafinaphala sutta potthapada thus is the bhikkhu endowed with morality repeat as in paras to that bhikkhu who clearly sees that the five hindrances have been got rid of becomes gladdened this gladness gives rise to piti delightful satisfaction and the delighted mind of the bhikkhu generates calm the bhikkhu who enjoys calmness experiences sukha bliss being blissful his mind gains concentration being detached from pleasures of the senses and demeritorious factors that bhikkhu achieves and remains in the first jhana which has vitakka initial application of the mind vicara sustained application of the mind piti delightful satisfaction and sukha bliss born of detachment from the hindrances nivarana his safifia of the pleasures of the senses that used to arise in him before attainment of jhana ceases at that time there arises delicate and really existing sarina of piti delightful satisfaction and sukha bliss born of detachment from the hindrances at that time the bhikkhu becomes one who is endowed with the delicate and really existing safifa of piti and sukha born of detachment from the hindrances in this way practice of adhisila sikkha high morality adhicitta sikkha concentration meditation or samatha bhavana and adhipanna sikkha vipassana insight and magga insight ceases nirujjhati this word can have two implications entirely ceases after arising or exising is absent because of lack of opportunity to arise here according to the commentary the words ‘ceases’ has the second implication potthapada sutta certain form of safifia arises through practice and certain form of safifia ceases through practice this is the practice said the bhagava and again potthapada having got rid of vitakka and vicara that bhikkhu achieves and remains in the second jhana with internal tranquillity with enhancement of one pointedness of concentration devoid of vitakka and vicara but with piti and sukha born of concentration his delicate and really existing safifia of piti and sukha born of detachment from the hindrances that used to arise in him before the attainment of the second jhana ceases at that time there arises delicate and really existing safina of piti and sukha born of concentration at that time the bhikkhu becomes one who is endowed with the delicate and really existing safiia of piti and sukha born of concentration in this way certain from of safifiad arises through practice and certain form of safifia ceases through practice this also is the practice said the bhagava and again potthapada having been detached from piti that bhikkhu dwells in upekkhd equanimity with mindfulness and clear comprehension and experiences sukha in mind and body he achieves and remains in the third jhana that which causes person who attains it to be praised by the ariyas as one who has upekkha equanimity and mindfulness one who abides in sukha his delicate and really existing sanfa of pitt and sukha born of concentration that used to arise in him before the attainment of the third jhana ceases at that time there arises delicate and really existing safifia of upekkha and sukha at that time the bhikkhu becomes one who is endowed with the delicate and really existing safifia of upekkha and sukha in this way certain form of safifia arises through practice and certain form of saffa ceases through practice this also is the practice said the bhagava and again potthapada by dispelling both pleasure and pain and by the previous disapperance ot gladness and sadness that bhikkhu achieves and remains in the fourth jhana without pain and pleasure state of equanimity and absolute purity of ae aw oe mindfulness his delicate and really existing saffa of upekkha siiakkhandha vagga and sukha that used to arise in him before the attainment of the fourth jhana ceases at that time there arises delicate and really existing safina without pain and pleasure at that time the bhikkhu becomes one who is cndowed with the delicate and really existing sana arises through practice and certain form of safina ceases through practice this also is the practice said the bhagava and again potthapada that bhikkhu concentrates on the concept ‘space is infinite’ and achieves and remains in the akasanaficayatana jhana where all forms of ripasaffa have been completely transcened all forms of pafighasafifia have vanished and all forms of nanattasafifia’ are not paid attention to his sanfa of corporeality that used to arise in him before the attainment of akasanaficayatana jhana ceases at that time there arises the delicate and really existing aakasanaficayatana jhana safina at that time the bhikkhu becomes one who is endowed with the delicate and really existing akasanancayatana jhana sania in this way certain form of safina arises through practice and certain form of safina ceases through practice this also is the practice said the bhagava and again potthapadda completely passing beyond the akasanaficayatana jhana that bhikkhu concentrates on the concept ‘consciousness is infinite’ and achieves and remains in the vininhanaficayatana jhana his delicate and really existing akasanaficayatana jhana sanfid that used to arise in him before the attainment of vififanaficayatana jhana ceases at that time there arises the delicate and really existing vififadnaficadyatana jhana safifid at that time the bhikkhu becomes one who is endowed with the delicate and really existing vififlanaficayatana rupasanna sania assoejated with ripa jhanas concentration meditation on corporeal object patighasanfia safifia that occurs on contact of the five senses with their objects also called paficaviihiana or mind conscious of the work of the five senses nanattasanina all forms of sama that take place in the kaméavacara sphere except patighasanna potthapada sutta olthapada su wt om jhana safna in this way certain form of saffiad ceases through practice this also is the practice said the bhagavad and again potthapada completely passing beyond the vififianaficayatana jhana that bhikkhu concentrates on the concept of nothingness and achieves and remains in the akificafifidyatana jhana his delicate and really existing vififidnaficdyatana jhana sanina that used to arise in him before the attainment of the akificafifidayatana jhdna ceases at that time there arises the delicate and really existing akificafifidyatana jhana saffia at that time the bhikkhu becomes one who is endowed with the delicate and really existing akificafifidyatana jhana saffa in this way certain form of safina ceases through practice this also is the practice said the bhagava in my teaching potthapadda that bhikkhu has initially sana of his own ie the first jhana safina then he progresses from cne stage the first jhana to the next the second jhana and from that to the next the third jhana and so on in sequence until he reaches the supreme form of safifid akificafifidyatana jhana safifia as he reaches it it occurs to him thus ‘it will not be proper for me to try to get absorbed in further jhana it will be proper for me not to get absorbed in it if were to try to get absorbed in it and strive for the higher nevasannananasanfayatana jhana this akificafinayatana jhana sanna might come to cessation and other forms of saffa which are gross might arise it would be better if do not try to get absorbed in it and do not try to strive for the higher jhana then that bhikkhu stops trying to get absorbed in it and striving for the higher jhana and in that bhikkhu who neither tries to get absorbed in it nor strives for the higher jhana that nevasafifianasafifidyatana jhana saffia ceases after arising for me gross forms of samfia by this is meant bhavan ga sanna the commentary merely states ‘tajha safinia of that jhana but the sub commentary explains it to be specifically ‘nevasafifianasafina’ yatana jhana saiifia the sanna of the jhana of acither safind nor non saniia silakkhandha vagga at wt one or two thought moments and no other forms of safna which are gross arise then he achieves the cessation of all forms of ‘safifia in this way potthapada the cessation of sanna nirodha samapatti is attained step by step by the bhikkhu who insight knowledge sampayjana now potthapada what do you think of this have you ever before heard of such attainment of cessation of safifia step by step by bhikkhu who has insight knowledge “no venerable sir have not but now understand what you say as follows in my teaching potthapada that bhikkhu has initially safind of his own the first jhana safima then he progresses from one stage the first jhana to the next the second jhana and from that to the next the third jhana and so on in sequence until he reaches the supreme form of safifia akificafifiayatana jhana sana as he reaches it it occurs to him thus ‘it will not be proper for me to try to get absorbed in further jhana it will be proper for me not to get absorbed in it if were to try to get absorbed in it and strive for the higher nevasafifianasanfayatana jhana this akificaihayatana jhana safiia might come to cessation and other forms of safifia which are gross might arise it would be better if do not try to get absorbed in it and do not try to strive for the higher jhana then that bhikkhu stops trying to get absorbed in it and striving for the higher jhana and in that bhikkhu who neither tries to get absorbed in it norstrives for the highter jhana that nevasannhanasafinayatana jhana safina ceases after arising for one or two thought moments and no other forms of sanfa which are gross arise then he achieves the cessation of all forms of safna in this way potthapada the cessation of safifia nfrodha samapatti is attained step by step by the bhikkhu who has insight knwoledge ”’ potthapada that is right said the bhagava venerable sir does the bhagava declare only one si preme form of safifia or many supreme forms of safifia potthapada sutta potthapada declare one supreme form of saffia as well as many supreme forms of safifia but venerable sir how is it that the bhagava declares one supreme form of safifia as well as many supreme forms of sanna potthapada whenever jhana safifd is achieved and then ceases that declare as the supreme forms of saffd thus declare one supreme forms of safifid as well as many supreme forms of safifia and venerable sir after nirodha samapatti does safina arise first and knowledge afterwards or does knowledge arise first and saffia afterwards or do saffia and knowledge arise simultaneously potthapada safifia arises first and knowledge follows knowledge arises only because of the arising of saffa that bhikkhu knows ‘knowledge springs up in me depending on the arising of sanna’ potthapada one should understand by this means that ‘safifia arises first and knowledge follows knowledge arises only because of the arising of saffa whether sanna is atta or not venerable sir is sanfa the atta of being or is safina one thing and atta another potthapada what kind of atta do you believe in venerable sir believe in atta that is made up of four great primary elements nourshed by solid nutriments and having corporeality and substantiality potthapada if in your view atta were made up of four great primary elements nourished by solid nutriments and in the buddha answer ‘sana’ refers to the anagamiphala safina or arahattaphala safina and ‘knowledge’ refers to paccavekkhananana which generally means reflection on magga phala nibbana uprooted defilements and remnant defilements but in this contex this term refers to reflection on anagimiphala or arahattaphala as the case may be paccavekkhanandna on these phalas arises invariably and spontaneously alter nirodha samapatti silakkhandha vaggz having corporeality and substantiality then in this case pofthapada in your view safia would be one thing and atta another potthapada that will be evident also from what now follows potthapada though that atta of your view made up of four great primary elements nourished by solid nutriments and having corporeality and substantiality remains constant yet some forms of safifa cease in this way po thapada it should he understood that safifia is one thing and atta another venerable sir believe in afta that is made of jhana mind and endowed completely with all minor and major physical organs and not deficient in any of the faculties of the senses potthapada if in your view atta were made of jhana mind and endowed completely with all the minor and major physical organs and not deficient in any of the faculties of the senses then in this case also potthapada in your view safina would be one thing and atta another potthapada that will be evident also trom what now follows potthapada through that atta of your view made of jhana mind and endowed completely with all the minor and major physical organs and not deficient in any of the faculties of the senses remains constant yet some forms of saffa in being arise and other forms of safifiad cease in this way potthapada it should be understood that safifa is one’thing and atta another venerable sir believe in atta that is without corporeality and that is made of safind jhana saffa potthapada if in your view atta were made of sana and is without corporeality then in this case also potthapada in your view safina would be one thing and afta anohter potthapada that will be evident also from what now follows potthapada through that atta of your view which is made of safifd and is without corporeality remains constant yet some forms of saffa in being arise and other forms of saffia ceasc in this way potthapada it should be understood that safind one thing and atta another potthapada sutta venerable sir will it be possible for me to know whether sand is the atta of being or whether saffid is one thing and atfla another potthapada hard will it be for you to know whether sanna is the alta of being or whether saffid is one thing and atta another as you hold different view belong to different faith have different inclination in belief pursue different practice and follow teacher of another school of doctrine venerable sir hf it is hard for me to know whether saminda is the alta of being or whether saffa is one thing and atta another since hold different view belong to different faith have different inclination in belicf pursue different practice and follow teacher of another school of doctrine venerable sir may know this is the world atta enternal is this view of enternalism truc while any other view is false potthapaida do not declare that the world is eternal and that only this view of cternalism is truc while any other vicw false then venerable sir is the world not cternal is this view of non cternity of the world truce while any other vicw is false potthapaida do not declare also that the world is not eternal and that only this vicw of non cternity of the world is true while any other vicw is false then venerable sir is the world finite is the world infinite is the soul giva the same as the body or the body the same as the soul or is the soul onc thing and the body another does sentient being exist alter death or does sentient being not exist after death or is it that sentient being docs as well as does not exist after death or is it that sentient being neither docs exist nor docs not exist after death is this view truce while any other view is falsc potthapada do not declare also that it is that sentient being neither does exist nor docs not exist after death and that only this view is true while any other vicw is false vencrable sir why docs the bhagava not make such declaration silakkhandha vagga potthapada it is not in consonance with one benefit it is not in consonance with the dhamma lokuttara dhamma it is noteven the beginning of the noble practice brahmacariya it is not conducive to the development of disillusionment with the five khandhas it is not conducive to the abandonment of allachment it is not conducive to the cessation of dukkha it is not conducive to the extincuion of defilements it is not conducive to the attainment of magga insight abhiina it is not conducive to the realization of the four noble truths it not conducive to the realization of nibbiina therefore do not make such declaration venerable sir what then does the bhagava declare potthadpada declar what dukkha is potthapada declare what the cause of dukkha is potthapada declare what the cessauon of dukkha is potthapada declare what the path leading to the cessation of dukkha is venerable sir why docs the bhagava make such declarauion potthapada it is in consonance with one benefit it is in consonance with the dhamma ¢c lokuttara dhamma it is the beginning of the noble practice brahmacanya it is conducive to the development of disillusionment with the five khandhas it is conducive to the abandonment of attachment it is conducive to the cessation of dukkha it is conducive to the extinction of defilements it is conducive to the attainment of magga insight abhinna it is conducive to the relization of the four noble turths it is conducive to the relizauion of nibbana hence make such declaration that indeed is so bhagava that indeed is so sugata vencrable sir the bhagava knows his own time when to leave then the bhagava rose trom his seat and left now no sooner had the bhagava left the place than the ascetics all round censured potthapada the wandering ascetic acrimoniously from all sides with these words lokuttara dhamma the dhamma of magga phala and nibbana potthapada sutta “this respected potthapada always has words of praise for whatever samana gotama says exclaiming ‘that indeed is so bhagava that indeed is so sugata however we fail to get to know what samana gotama has expounded as matters of certainty in relation to the propositions whether the world is eternal or not eternal whether the world is finite or infinite whether the soul is the same as the

it is that sentient being neither does exist nor does not exist alter death when this was said potthapada the wandering ascetic replicd thus to those ascctics “t also do not know triends any matter of certainty that samana gotama has expounded in relation to the propositions whether the world is eternal or not eternal whether it is that sentient being neither does exist nor does not exist after death but samana gotama declares the practice which is true real correct having the dhamma lokuttara dhamma as its basis and which is enduring according to the lokuttara dhamma why should not appreciating what is well spoken praise the good words of samana gotama who declares the practice which is true real correct having the dhamma lokuttara dhamma as its basis and which is enduring according to the lokuttara dhamma about citta son of an elephant trainer and potthapada now two or three days later citta the son of an elephant tainer and potthapada the wandering ascetic approached the bhagava having thus approached the bhagava citta the silakkhandha vagga son of an elephant trainer did obcisance to the bhagava and took his seat in suitable place potthapada the wandering ascetic on the other hand offered courteous grectings to the bhagava who replied fittingly and having said memorable words of clicitation he also took his seat after taking the seat potthapada the wandcring ascetic said to the bhagava “vencrable sir no sooner had the bhagava left than the ascetics all round censured me acrimoniously from all sides with these words ‘this respected potthapada always has

of the body in which it had lived and approached them and asked potthapada sutta “friends is it true you believe and declare that atta is indeed eternal bliss it does not perish after the death of the

it is milk it is not called curds or cream or butter or ghee at the time when it is milk it is called milk but when it is curds when it is cream when it is butter when it is ghee it is not called milk

the tathagata uses these terms but does not consider them in wrong way when that has been said potthapada the wandering ascetic addressed the bhagava thus “venerable sir excellent is the dhamma venerable sir excellent is the dhamma just as venerable sir one turns up what lies upside down just as one uncovers what lies covered just as one shows the way to another who is lost just as one holds up lamp in the darkness for those with eyes to see visible objects even so have you revealed the dhamma to me in various ways venerable sir take refuge in the buddha take refuge in the dhamma and take refuge in the samigha please take me as lay disciple from now on till the end of my life citta son of elephant trainer requests admission into the order and citta the son of the elephant trainer addressed the bhagava thus “venerable sir excellent is the dhamma venerable sir excellent is the dhamma just as venerable sir one has turned up what lies upside down just as one has uncovered what lies covered just as one shows the way to another who is lost just as one holds up lamp in the darkness for those with eyes to see visible objects even so have you revealed the silakkhandha vagga dhamma to me in various ways venerable sir take refuge in the buddha take refuge in the dhamma and take refuge in the samgha may in the presence of the bhagava be permitted to go forth from the world may receive admission into the order citta the son of the elephant trainer was initated into the order in the presence of the bhagava and subsequently admitted as bhikkhu not long after citta the son of the elephant trainer dwelling along and in seclusion vigilant and zealous inclined his mind to nibbana and he soon attained by himself in this very life by virtue of magga insight the fruits of the noblest and the most supreme arahatship which is the ultimate goal for which men of good family renounce hearth and home to lead the homeless life then he knew that rebirth was no more for him that he had lived the life of purity that what he had to do for the realization of magga had been done and that he had nothing more to do for such realization and so the venerable citta the son of the elephant trainer became one of the arahats end of potthapada sutta the ninth in this vagga namo tassa bhagavato arahato sammasambuddhassa subha sutta subha sutta the story of young subha thus have heard at one time not long after the bhagavas passing away to nibbana the venerable ananda was residing at jetavana monastery of anathapindika in savatthi at that time young subha the son of todeyya was staying in savatthi on certain bussiness then young subha the son of todeyya called up certain young man and said “come young man go to samana ananda convey my words to him and enquire if he is free from illness and disease feeling buoyant and strong enjoying physical well being by saying “young subha the son of todayya enquires if the venerable ananda is free from illness and disease feeling buoy ant and strong enjoying physical well being “and also request him “young subha the son of todayya respectfully requests the venerable ananda to be so kind as to pay him visit to his house saying “very well sir to young’ subha the son of todeyya the young man approached the venerable ananda and exchanged greetings with him having said memo rable words of felicitations he sat in suitable place and addressed the venerable ananda thus “young subbha the son of todeyya has enquired if the venerable ananda is free from illness and disease being buoy ant and strong and enjoying physical well being and he has requested the venerable ananda to be so kind as to pay him visit to his house on thus being informed the venerable ananda said to the young man “young man now is not the right time for the visit have taken some medicine today perhaps tomorrow depending on the circumstances and time may make the visit silakkhandha vagga saying “very well venerable sir to the venerable ananda the young man went to young subha the son of todeyya and said “we have delivered your message to the venerable ananda saying “young subha the son of todeyya had en quired if the venerable ananda is free form illness and disease feeling buoyant and strong and enjoying physical well being and have also requested the venerable ananda to be so kind as to pay visit to the house of young subha the son of todeyya sir as said this the venerabie ananda replied “young man now is not the right time for the visit have taken some medicine today perhaps tomorrow depending on the circum stances and time may make the visit then young subha said “friend the task is done for the venerable ananda has agreed to come to me tomorrow then after that night had passed carly in the morning the venerable ananda rearranged his robes suitably carrying the great robe and the alms bowl approached the house of young subha the son of todeyya accompanied by bhikkhu cetaka and sat on seat prepared for him then young subha the son of todeyya approached the venerable ananda and exchanged greetings having said memorable words of felicitations he sat in suitable place and having seated himself he addressed he venerble ananda thus “venerable ananda for long time you attended on the venerable gotama remaining closc to him and always at his beck and call the venerable gotarma had praises for certain dhammas urging people to take thei upon themselves dwell in them and become firmly established in them the venerable ananda might have known them what venerable ananda are those dhammas which he urged peopie to take upon themselves dwell in them and become firmly established in them young man the bhagava had praises for the three groups of dhammas urging people to take them upon themselves dwell in them and become firmly established in them subha sutta and what are these three groups young man they are the group of ariya morality the group of ariya concentration and the group of ariya knowledge he urged people to take them upon themselves dwell in them and become firmly established in them the group of morality venerable ananda the venerable gotama had words of praise for the group of ariya morality and he caused the people to take it upon themselves dwell in it and become firmly established in it what is that group of ariya morality precepts young man there has appeared in this world that bhagava who is worthy of special veneration who truly comprehends all dhammas by his own intellect and insight who possesses su preme knowledge and perfect practice of morality who speaks only what is beneficial and true who knows all the three lokas worlds who is incomparable in taming those who deserve to be tamed who is the teacher of devas and men who is the enlightened one knowing and teaching the four ariya truths and who is the most exalted through perfect wisdom he personally realizes the nature of the universe with its devas mdaras and brahmas and also the world of human beings with its samanas and brahmanas kings and men and knowing it he expounds on it he proclaims the dhamma which is excellent at the beginning excellent at the middle and excellent at the end with richness in meaning and words he reveals the complete ness and purity of the noble practice householder or his son or anyone belonging to any caste listens to that dhamma and on hearing it he develops conviction in the tathagata when conviction is thus developed he considers thus “confined is the life of householder it is path laden with dust of defilement samana’s life is like an open plain difficult it is for layman to pursue the noble practice in all its fullness in all its purity like polished conch now it were better for me to shave off my hair and beard don the bark silakkhandha vagga dyned robe renounce hearth and home and become recluse leading the homeles life afterwards that man giving up his wealth great or small leaving his relatives be they few or be they many shaves off his hair and beard dons the bark dyed robe renounces hearth and home and becomes recluse leading the homeless life when he has thus become samana he practises self restraint in accordance with the fundamental precepts patimokkhasamivara sila he is endowed with good practice and resorts to suitable places he now sees danger even in the least offences he observes the precepts well being possessed of good deeds and good words he pursues pure livelihood he is endowed with morality he has his sense doors guarded he attains mindfulness and clearness of comprehension he is contented young man how is bhikkhu endowed with morality herein young man bhikkhu abandons all thoughts of taking life setting aside the stick and the sword ashamed to do evil and he is compassionate and dwells with solicitude for the welfare of all living beings young man when that bhikkhu thus abandons all thoughts of taking life setting aside the stick and the sword ashamed to do evil and is compassionate dwelling with solicitude for the welfare of living beings this virtue is one of the precepts of his morality amplify as in samafifaphala sutta and then there are certain respected samanas and brahmanas who living on the food offered out of conviction in kamma and its results make wrongful living by means of low arts contrary to correct living conducive to the attainment of deva realms and nibbana and what are they they are propitiating the devas by promises of offerings making offerings to devas for favours granted causing possession by minor morality see para above middle morality see para major morality see para subha sutta spirits or exercising them casting spells with magical formulae learnt in mud house turning eununch into man turning man into eununch practising the art of choosing building sites propitiating devas while choosing building sites practising the profession of mouth washing or bathing fire worshipping caus ing vomitting giving purgatives using emetics or catharses letting out phlegm etc from the head preparing ear drops or eye drops preparing medicinal snuff or eye ointment to remove cataracts preparing eye lotions curing cataracts doing surgery practising paediatrics preparing basic drugs and dressing sores and removing the dressing bhikkhu abstains from making wrongful living by such means young man thus there are certain respected samanas and brahmanas who living on the food offered out of convic tion in kamma and its results make wrongful living by means of low arts contrary to correct living conducive to the attainment of deva realms and nibbana and what are they ‘they are propitiating the devas by promises of offerings and dressing sores and removing the dressing the bhikkhu abstains from making wrongful living by such means this also is one of the precepts of his morality indeed young man bhikkhu thus endowed with morality encounters no danger in any way on account of his practice of morality sovereign duly anointed and installed as king after having defeated his enemies can encounter no danger whatsoever from his enemies in the same way bhikkhu thus endowed with morality encounters no danger on account of his practice of morality in any way that bhikkhu possessing this group of ariya morality enjoys within himself happiness that is free from blame thus is bhikkhu endowed with morality young man the bhagava had words of praise for that group of ariya morality urging the people to take it upon themselves dwell in it and become firmly established in it this is the group of ariya morality but herein there are many higher silakkhandha vagga wonderful ananda extraordinary ananda that noble group of ariya is not imperfect it is full and complete ananda never noticed any group of ariya morality in any other samanas or brahmanas outside this teaching ananda if other samanas and brahmanas see such noble group of ariya morality in their inner selves they would become satisfied and pleased even with this much of it satisfied and pleased they would have said this much is adequate with this much to do all there is to be done is done and we now have realized the advantages of being samana we have no higher thing whatever to do beyond observing the group of ariya morality and yet the venerable ananda has said ‘“‘there are many higher tasks to be done beyond obeserving the group of ariya morality the group of concentration ananda the venerable gotama had words of praise tor the group of ariya concentration and he caused the people to take it upon themsleves dwell in it and become firmly established in it what is that group of ariya concentra tion young man how does bhikkhu keep the sense doors guarded young man in this world whenever bhikkhu sees visible object with his eyes he does not take in its appearance such as male or female nor its secondary details such as shape of arms legs etc or way of smiling laughing etc for if the faculty of sight is left unguarded such depraved states of mind as covetousness and dissatisfaction stemming from that would overpower him as he fails to control his senses so he sets himself to the task of guarding his faculty of sight keeps watch on it and gains control over it whenever he hears sound with the ears whenever he smells an odour with his nose whenever he tastes flavour with the tongue whenever he makes contact with the body whenever he congnizes mind object with the mind he does not take in its appearance such as male or female nor its secondary details subha sutta such as shape of arms legs etc or way of smiling laughing etc for if the faculty of mind is left unguarded such depraved states of mind as covetousness and dissatisfaction stemming from that would overpower him as he fails to conrol his senses so he sets himself to the task of guarding his faculty of mind keeps watch on it and gains control over it and the bhikkhu endowed with this ariya control of the sense faculties enjoys within himself happines unalloyed with defilments of the mind in this way young man bhikkhu keeps the sense doors guarded young man in this world how is bhikkhu endowed wth mindfulness and clear comprehension bhikkhu keeps himself completely aware in moving forwards or back keeps himself completely aware in looking forward or sideways keeps himself completely aware in carrying or wearing the great robe the double layered robe alms bowl and the other two robes keeps himself completely aware in eating drinking chew ing and savouring food and beverages keeps himself com pletely aware in urinating and defecating keeps himself com pletely aware in walking standing sitting falling asleep wak ing speaking and observing silence thus young man is bhikkhu endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension young man how does bhikkhu become contented in this teaching young man bhikkhu remains contented with robes just sufficient to protect his body and with food just sufficient to sustain him wherever he goes that bhikkhu carries with him only his requisites wherever winged bird flies it flies only with its burden of wings in the same way young man bhikkhu is content with his robes that protect his body and his food that sustains him wherever he goes he carries with him only his requisites thus young man does bhikkhu remain contented then that bhikkhu endowed with the noble group of ariya morality this ariya self control this ariya mindfulness and clear comprehension and this ariya contentedness chooses silakkhandha vagga for habitation lonely spot in the woods or at the foot of tree or on hill side or in gully or in mountin cave or in cemetery or in thicket or in an open plain or on heap of straw returning from the round of alms and having had his meal he sits down cross legged and upright and establishes mindfulness in meditation then that bhikkhu dissociates himself from cov eting the world of the five aggregates of clinging and abides with his mind free from covetousness thereby cleansing himself of covetousness altogether he dissociates himself from ill will abides with his mind free from ill will and develops goodwill towards all living beings thereby cleansing himself of ill will altogether he dissociates himself from sloth and torpor abides with his mind free from sloth and torpor with clear perception of mindfulness and comprehension thereby cleansing himself of sloth and torpor altogether he dissociates himself from restless ness and worry abides with his mind in calmness within thereby cleansing himself of restlessnes and worry altogether he disso ciates himself from doubt abides with his mind free from doubt and does not waver in his faith in meritorious dhamma thereby cleansing himself of doubt altogether young man take the example of man who did business with borrowed money as his business prospered he paid up his old debts he also acquired profit with which he could maintain his family then it occurred to him thus “formerly worked on borrowed money now my busi ness has prospered have paid up my old debts and acquired profit with which could maintain my family free from debt that man became pleased and dilighted young man take another example that of man afflicted with disease suffering pain extremely ill and having no appetite and fosing physical strength afterwards he recovered from illness his appetite returned and he gained his physical strength then he said to himself thus “formely was atflicted with disease suffering pain extremely ill and losing appetite and physical strength now subha sutta have recovered from illness my appetite returned and have regained my physical strength having recovered from illness that man became pleased and delighted young man take another example that of man confined in prison later he was released from prison safe and sound without losing any property then it occurred to him thus “formely was confind in prison now have been released from prison safe and sound without losing any prop erty released from prison that man became pleased and delighted young man take another example that of slave who was not his own master but subject to another unable to go about as he pleased later he was treed from slavery becoming once again his own master and able to go about as he pleased then it occurred to him thus “formerly was slave not my own master but subject to another unable to go about as pleased now have been freed from slavery becoming once again my own master not subject to another and able to go about as pleased becoming free that man became pleased and delighted young man take another example that of man who carrying all his treasures and wealth travelled on long difficult and dangerous journey where the threat of famine was present later he completed that difficult journey and arrived safely at village where there was peace and security then it occurred to him thus “formely travelled on long difficult and dangerous journey where the threat of famine was present now have completed that difficult journey and arrived safely at the village where there is peace and security having come to safety that man became pleased and delighted ae andha vagga silakkhandha vagg young man bhikkhu clearly sees the five hindrances that have not been got rid of from within himself as indebtedness disease imprisonmet enslavement and difficult and dangerous journey young man bhikkhu clearly sees the discard ing of the five hindrances trom within himself as gaining freedon from indebtedness dissease imprisonment enslavement and as reaching place of safety that bhikkhu who clearly sees that the five hindrances have been got rid of from within himself becomes pleased being pleased there arises delightful satisfaction piti and the delighted mind of the bhikkhu generates calm the bhikkhu who enjoys calmness of the body experiences bliss sukha being blissful his mind gains concertration the first jhana being detached from sensual pleasures and demeritorious factors that bhikkhu achieves and remains in the first jhdna which is accompanied by initial application of the mind vitakka and sustained application of the mind vicara and which has delightful satisfaction piti and bliss sukha which are born of detachment from the hindrences nivarana he soaks drenches fills up and gets his body permeated his body with piti and sukha which are born of detachment from the hindrances there is not single place in his body not permeated with piti and sukha which are born of detachment from hindrances young man take the example of skilful bath attendant or his assistant who strews bath powder in brass dish sprinkles water again and again on it and makes it into mass that mass is formed by sticky substance which spreads out so that no water can seep through it in the same way young man that bhikkhu soaks drenches fills up and gets his body permeated with piti and sukha which are born of detachment from the hindrances there is not subha sutta single place in his body not permeated with piti and sukha which are born of detachment from hindrances young man being detached from sensual pleasures and demeritorious factors that bhikkhu achieves and remains the first jhana accompanied by initial application of the mind vitakka which has delightful satisfaction piti and bliss sukha born of detachment from the hindrances nivarana he soaks drenches fillsup and gets his body permeated with piti and sukha which are born of detachment from hindrances there is not single place in his body not suffused with piti and sukha which are born of detachment from hindrances this first jhana is also that bhikkhu concentration the second jhana and again young man having got rid of vitakka and vicara that bhikkhu achieves and remains in the second jhana with internal serenity with enhancement of one pointed ness of mind which are devoid of vitakka and vicara but with piti and sukha which are born of concentration he soaks drenches fills up and gets his body permeated with piti and sukha which are born of concentration there is not single place in his body not suffused with piti and sukha which are born of concentration young man take the example of deep lake with water welling up trom spring below there is no inlet from either east or south or west or north it does not rain heavily or regularly there and yet the current of cool water which wells up from that lake soaks drenches fills up and gets the lake permeated with the cool water there is not single place in that lake not permeated with it in the same way young

any remainders silakkhandha vagga then kevatta that great brahma took the bhikkhu by the arm led him to place and said to him “o bhikkhu these brahmas of the brahma world hold the belief that there is nothing that the great brahma does not know that there is nothing that the great brahma does not see that there is nothing that the great brahma does not understand and that there is nothing that the great brahma has not realized therefore gave no answer in their presence too do not know bhikkhu where the four primary of extension of solidity of cohesion of heat and of motion come to total cessation without leaving any remainder you bhikkhu have done wrong and acted improperly to by pass the bhagava in undertaking this search for an answer to this question go you bhikkhu and approach the bhagava and ask him this question and bear in mind what the bhagavad has to say then kevatta that bhikkhu vanished from the brahma world within the space of time required by strong man to stretch his bended arm or to bena his outstretched arm and appeared before me afterwards kevatta that bhikkhu having done his obei sance and having seated himself asked me the question “venerable sir where do the four primary elements of extension of solidity of cohesion of heat and of motion come to total cessation without leaving any remainder the simile of the land sighting burd as that bhikkhu asked me kevatta said to him “in days of yore bhikkhu sea faring traders used to set out in ships across the ocean bringing with them land sighting bird which they set free when ships lost sight of the shore that bird flew east south west and north to the zenith and to the intermediate points of the compass when it caught sight of the land in the neighbourhood it would fly thither but when no land was sighted around it would return to the ship just so bhikkhu do you come back to me failing to get solution even kevatta sutta in the brahma world bhikkhu you should not pose the ques tion as you did ‘where do the four primary elements of extension of solidity of cohesion of heat and of motion come to total cessation bhikkhu you should ask thus “where do the elements of extension of solidity of cohesion of heat and of motion find no footing where do the long and the short the small and the great the agreeable and the disagreeable do not exist where do nama mentality and rapa materiality cease caving no remainder that question has this answer “there is nibbana which is comprehensible only by special apprerception which is unseeable by the ordinary eye which is infinite being unbounded by the limits of arising development and dissolution and accessible like landing place from all sides “there the elements of extension of solidity of cohe sion of heat and of motion find no footing there the long and the short the small and the great the agreeable and the dis agreeable do not exist there both nama mentality and rapa materiality cease leaving no remainder there in nibbana due to the cessation of consciousness these nama and ripa cease thus spoke the bhagava kevatta the son of the rich householder rejoiced at the words of the bhagava end of kevatta sutta the eleventh in this vagga according to the commentaries conciousness vififidna comprises carimaka vififidna the very last consciousness that brings samsara the round of existences to an end and abhisankhara vififidna consciousness that serves as like to rebirth namo tassa bhagavato arahato sammasambuddhassa xii lohicca suuta xii lohicca sutta the story of brahmana lohicca thus have heard at one time the bhagava was making tour of the country of the kosalans with large company of bhikkhus numbering five hundered and came to salavatika village at that time brahmana lohicca was the lord of salavatika densely populated was the lord of salavatika densely populated village teeming with livestock abundent in fodder firewood water and grains he had power over the village as if he were king it was granted him permanently as royal gift by pasendi king of the kosalans now at that time there had arisen in the mind of brahmana lohicca wicked view in the following manner in this world samana or brahmana could earn merit but having earned merit he should not declare it to anyone for what can one do for another to declare it would be like severing an old bond to get entangled in new one this declaration say is form of wicked desire for what can one do for another meanwhile brahmana lohicca heard this news “indeed friends samana gotama sakyan prince who had gone forth trom sakyan clan as recluse has been touring the country of the kosalans and has arrived at the village of salavauka with large company of five hundred bhikkhus of the order the good fame and reputation of that venerable gotama has spread far and wide thus that bhagava is worthy of special veneration araham he truly comprehends all the dhammas by his own intellect and insight sammasambuddha he possesses supreme knowledge and perfect practice of morality vijjacaranasampanna he speaks only what is beneficial and true sugata he knows all the three lokas lokavidt he is incomparable in taming those who deserve to be tamed anuttaro purisa dammasarathi he is the silakkhandha vagga teacher of devas and men sattha devamanussanam he is the enlightened one knowing and teaching the four noble truths buddha and he is the most exalted bhagava through perfect wisdom he personally realizes the na ture of the universe with its devas madras and brahmanas and also the world of human beings with its samanas and brahmanas kings and men and knowing it by himself through sabbafifiuta fiafia he expounds on it he proclaims the dhamma which is excellent at the beginning excellent at the middle and excellent at the end with richness in meaning and words he makes clear the completeness and purity of the noble practice it is indeed good to pay respect to such arahats then brahmana lohicca said to rosika the bar ber “come now friend rosika go to samana gotama and ask him in my name if he is free from illness and disease feeling buoyant and strong and enjoying physical well being “also say to him ‘o gotama brahmana lohicca has asked if the revered gotama is free fiom illness and disease feeling buoyant and strong and enjoying physical well being and also request the revered gotama together with the bhikkhus of the order to accept brahmana lohicca invita tion for tomorrow meal saying “very well sir rosika the baber ap proached the bhagava made obeisance to him and took his seat in suitable place having seated himself he addressed the bhagava thus “venerable sir brahmana lohicca has enquired if the bhagava is free from illness and disease feeling buoyant and strong and enjoying physical well being and requested that the bhagavad together with the bhikkhus of the order to accept his invitation for tomorrow meal the bhagava showed acceptance by remaining silent tta lohicca su then rosika the barber knowing that the bhagava had accepted the invitation arose and having made obeisance to the bhagava and departed respectfully returned to brahmana lohicca and said to him “we conveyed your words to that bhagava thus ‘brahmana lohicca enquires if the bhagava is free from illness and discase feeling buoyant and strong and enjoying physical well being’ and also we have made the request saying “may the bhagava together with the bhikkhus of the order accept brahmana lohicca invitation for tomorrow meal ”and that bhagava has accepted the invita tion then as the night passed brahmana lohicca prepared at his house choice food both hard and soft said to rosika the barber “come now rosika go to samana gotama and inform him the meal is ready by saying ‘it is time gotama the meal is ready saying “very well sir rosika the barber went to the bhagava and having seated himself in suitable place after due obeisance to the bhagava informed him that it was time to come saying “venerable sir the meal is ready and in the moming the blessed one rearranging his robes carrying the alms bowl and the great robe set out for salacatika village together with the bhikkhus of the order then rosika the barber walked step by step behind the bhagavad and rosika the barber spoke to the bhagava thus venerable sir there has arisen in the mind of brahmana lohicca wicked view in the following manner ‘in this world samana or brahmana could earn merit but having earned merit he should not declare it to anyone for what can one do for another to declare it would be like severing an old bond to get entangled in new one this declara tion say is form of wicked desire for what dha vagga silakkhandha vagg can one do for another ‘venerable sir it would be well if the bhagava would disengage him from such wrong view “that may be possible rosika said the bhagava “that may be possible and the bhagavad went to brahmana lohicca house sat down on the seat prepared for him and brahmana lohicca himself served the choice food hard and soft to the bhikkhus of the order headed by the bhagava till they being satisfied refused any more interrogating brahmana lohicca and when the bhagava had finished his meal and withdrawn his hand from the bowl brahmana lohicca took low seat and sat thereon in suitable place to him thus seated the bhagava spoke as follows “is it true lohicca that there has arisen in your mind wicked view in the following manner “in this world samana or brahmana could earn merit but having earned merit he should not declare it to anyone for what can one do for another to declare it would be like severing an old bond to get entangled new one this declaration say is form of wicked desire for what can one do for another that is true gotama now what do you think of this are you not adminis tering the village of salavatika that is so gotama then lohicca suppose someone saiu his ty yeu “brahmana lohicca is administering the village of salavitaka let him enjoy all the revenue and the produce of salavitaka village without distributing them to anyboay then would or would not such man who said so be danger to those who live in depedence on you yes gotama

engender loving kindness or hatred in respect of those people hatred gotama if hatred is engendered is the view of hatred right or wrong it is wrong gotama lohicca declare that one who harbours wrong view has only one of the two destinations for him either the realm of continuous suffering niraya or the world of animals now what do you think of this is not pasenadi king of the kosalans ruling in the kingdom of kasi and kosala yes that is so gotama and then suppose lohicca someone said this to you “pasenadi king of the kosalans is ruling in the king doms of kasi and kosala let the king alone enjoy the revenue and produce of the kingdoms of kasi and kosala without distributing them to anybody in that case would not such man who said so be danger to those who live in dependence on pasenadi

dependence on you as he is danger maker he is unsympathetic to the cause of their welfare as he is unsympathetic hatred is engenderd engendering hatred is wrong view lohicca in the same way if someone were to say “in this world samana or brahmana could earn merit but once he has earned it he should not declare it to anyone for what can one do for another to declare it would be like severing an old bond to get entangled in new one for what can one do for another that person is but creating danger for those men of good family who have taken upon themselves the teaching of the tathagata and have

crificized such criticism is truthful justified in accordance with the dhamma and inoffensive and what are the three lohicca there is type of teacher who having given up home for homelessness to enjoy the fruits of the life of bhikkhu teaches his pupils “this is beneficial to you this is for your own happiness even though he has not actully enjoyed the fruits of the life of bhikkhu but the pupils neither obey him nor give ear to his words nor show any interest in the knowledge imparted but depart from the course of instrucions that he teaches such type of teacher should be criticized thus revered sir you have given up home for homeless to enjoy the fruits of the life of bhikkhu but even though you have not actually enjoyed the fruits of the lite of bhikkhu you teach your pupils “this is beneficial to you this is for your own happiness but your pupils neither obey you nol give ear to your words nor show any interest in the knowledge im parted but depart from the course of instructions that you teach silakkhandha vagga such teaching is like making advances to maiden who has rejected and left the suitor or like embracing the maiden who has turned her face away therefore say that it is form of wicked desire for what can one man do for another “this lohicca is the first type of teacher in this world who should be criticized and if he be criticized such criticism is truthful justified in accordance with the dhamma and inoffen sive and then lohicca there is another type of teacher who having given up home for homelessness to enjoy the fruits of the life of bhikkhu teaches his pupils “this is beneficial to you this is for your own happiness” even though he has not actually enjoyed the fruits of the life of bhikkhu his pupils obey him give ear to his words show interest in the knowledge imparted and practise it without any departure from the course of instructions that he teaches such type of teacher should be criticized thus “revered sir you have given up home tor homelessness to enjoy the fruits of the life of bhikkhu but even though you have not actually enjoyed the fruits of the life of bhikkhu you teach your pupils ‘this is beneficial to you this is for your own happiness and your pupils obey you give ear to your words show interest in the knowledge imparted and practise it without any departure from the course of instuctions that you teach such teaching is like neglecting one own field and weeding another therefore say that it is torm of wicked desire for what can one man do for another “this lohicca is the second type of teacher in this world who should be criticized and if he be criticized such criucism is truthful jusufied in accordance with the dhamma and inoffensive and then lohicca there is another type of teacher who having given up home for homelessness to enjey the fruits of the life of bhikkhu teaches his pupils “this is beneficial to you this is for your own happiness’ after he has enjoyed the fruits of the life of bhikkhu but his pupils neither obo him lohicca sutta nor give ear to his words nor show any interest in the knowl edge imparted but depart from the course of insterest in the knowledge imparted but depart from the course of instructions that he teaches such type of teacher should be criticized thus “revered sir you have given up home for homelessness and as you have enjoyed the fruits of the life of bhikkhu you teach your pupils ‘this is beneficial to you this is for your own happiness but your pupils neither obey you nor give ear to your words nor show any interest in the knowledge imparted but depart from the course of instructions that you teach such teaching is like severing an old bond to get entangled in new one therefore say that it is form of wicked desire for what can one man do for another this lohicca is the type of teacher in this world who should be criticized and if he be criticized such criticism is truthful justified in accordance with the dhamma and inoffen sive and these lohicca are the three types of teachers who should be criticized whoever criticizes these stands to be truth ful justified and inoffensive the teacher who should not be criticized when the bhagava had spoken thus brahmana asked him “o gotama is there any teacher who should not be criticized yes lohicca there is teacher who should not be criticized gotama who may he be that should not be criti cized lohicca there appears in this world the tathagata who is worthy of special veneration perfectly self enlightened etc amplify as in the samannaphala sutta lohicca thus is the bhikkhu accomplished in morality he attains and abides in the first jhana under teacher like him pupil gains distinction and eminence in the dhamma silakkhandha vagga in this world lohicca such teacher ought not to be cricitized and if he be criticized such criticism is untruthful unjustified not in accordance with the dhamma and offensive he the bhikkhu abides in the second jhana the third jhana the fourth jhana under teacher like him pupil gains the highest perfection in the dhamma in this world lohicca such teacher should not be criticized and if he be criticized such criticism untruthful unjusuficd not in accordance with the dhamma and olfcnsive he directs and inclines his mind to insight knowledge under teacher hike him pupil gains the highest perfection eminence in the dhamma in this world lohicca such teacher should not be cricitized and if he be criticized such criticism is untruthful unjustified not in accordance with the dhamma and offensive when this was said brahmana lohicca addressed the bhagava thus “o gotama just as man caught hold of the other on the point of falling over precipice into the chasm of the nether world below by the hair of his head and lifted him up safe back on firm ground so also has the revered gotama lifted me up on the point of falling over the precipice into the chasm down below and landed me on firm ground excellent gotama is the dhamma excellent gotama is the dhamma just as one turns up what lies upside down just as one uncovers what lies covered just as one shows the way to another who lost just as one holds up lamp in the darkness for those with eyes to see visible objects even so have you revealed the dhamma to me in various ways revered gotama take refuge in the revered gotama take refuge in the dhamma take refuge in the order of bhikkhus may be taken as lay disciple from now on ull the end of my life end of lohicca sutta the twelfth in this vagga namo tassa bhagavato arahato sammasambuddhassa xii tevijja sutta xi tevija sutta conversation between vasettha and bharadvaja thus have heard once while touring through the country of kosalans with large company of bhikkhus of the order numbering five hundred the bhagava came to manasakata village of the brahmanas and stayed in the mango grove on the bank of the river aciravati to the north of that village at that time many very distinguished and wealthy brahmanas were also staying at manasakata namcly brahmana canki brahmana tdarukkha brahmana pokkharasati brahmana janusoni brahmana todcyya and other very distinguished and wealthy brahmanas then conversation arose between settha and bharadvaja young brahmanas as they were walking up and down each following the other for exercise as to the true path and the false that leads to companionship with the brahma young vasettha said “only this path declared by brahmana pokkharasati is the straight path it alone is the direct path walking this path will certainly lead one to be with the brahma but young bharadvaja had this to say “only this path declared by brahmana tarukkha is the straight path it alone is the direct path walking this path will certainly lead one to be with the brahma neither young vasettha was able to convince young bharadvaja nor young bharadvaja in turn was able to con vince young v§asettha then young vasettha said to young bharadvaja “friend bharadvaja samana gotama the son of the sakya king who left the sakyan family to become bhikkhu is now staying in the mango grove on the bank of the river aciravati to the north of manasakata village silakkhandha vagga “the fame of that venerable gotama has spread far and wide it is said of him ‘that bhagava is worthy of special veneration who truly comprehends all dhammas by his own intellect and insight who possesses supreme knowledge anc perfect practice of morality who speaks only what is beneficial and true who knows all the three lokas worlds who is incomparable in taming those who deserve to be tamed who is the teacher of devas and men who is the enlightened one knowing and teaching the four noble truths and who is the most exalted “friend bharadvaja let us go to samana gotama having approached him let us ask samana gotama about this matter and bear in mind what he says “very well friend said young bharadvaja to young vasettha the true and the false path then the young brahmanas vasettha and bharadvaja approached the bhagava and having approached him exchanged greatings with him saying memorable words of felicitations having done so they sat in suitable place when they were thus seated young vasettha addressed the bhagava thus “o gotama conversation has arisen between us we walked up and down each following the other for exercise as to the true path and the false that leads one to be with the brahma “t said “only this path declared by brahmana pokkharasat is the straight path it alone is the direct path walking this path will certainly lead one to be with the brahma “but young bharadvaja said ‘only this path declared by brahmana tarukkha is the straight path it alone is the direct path one who walks this path is bound to gain companionship with the brahma “o gotama there has arisen an opposition conflict and variation of beliefs betweeen us over this matter tevijja sutta vasettha is it not that you say “only this path declared by brahmana pokkharasati is the straight path it alone is the direct path walking this path will certainly lead one to be with the brahma it is not that young bharadvaja says “only this path declared by brahmana tarukkha is the straight path it alone is the direct path walking this path will certainly lead one to be with the brahma vasettha wherein then is an opposition conflict and variation of beliefs between you it concerns gotama with the path whether it is straight or not replied vasettha gotama various brahmanas such as brahmana addhariya brahmana tituraya brahmana chandoka and brahmana bhavarijja declare them in various ways all those paths when trodden according to their direction do lead one to gain com panionship with the brahma gotama just as the many and varied paths in the vicinity of village or town lead to the same village or the same town sq also gotama the various paths declared by various brahmanas such as brahmana addhariya brahmana tittiriya brahmana chandoka and brahmana bhavharijja icad one treading those paths to gain companionship with the brahma the young vasa tha interrogated vasettha do you say that they all lead ie companionship with the brahma say so

you who are setting up stair case to go up to turreted mansion know whether that mansion is in the east or in the south or in the west or in the north whether it is high or low or of medium height when thus questioned he would answer “no then he should be asked further “friend so you are setting up stair case to go up to turreted mansion that you neither know nor see aren you when thus questioned he might answer “yes now vasettha what do you think of this if that be so are not the words of that man without substance gotama if that be so the words of that man are certainly without substance vasettha just so they are these brahmanas versed in the three vedas say that they have never seen the brahma face to face the teachers of the brahmanas versed in the three vedas also say that they have never seen the brahma face to face the teachers of the teachers of the brahmanas versed in the three vedas also say that they have never seen the brahma face to face the teachers of the brahmanas versed in the three vedas up to the seventh generation also say that they have never seen the brahma face to face and then vasettha there are isis who are the first and foremost among the teachers of the brahmanas versed in the three vedas who authored and delivered the vedic mantras the brahmanas of today chant or intone or recite the words of the ancient vedic mantras in the way they were chanted or intone or recited or taught by those isis and who are those isis they are atthaka vamaka vamadeva vessamitta yamadaggi angirasa bharadvaja vasettha kassapa and bhagu it has however been said that those isis never declared “we know and we also see where the brahama is whence he comes and whither he goes and yet those brahmanas versed in the three vedas say this is the straight path “this is the direct path walking this path will certairly lead one to be together with the brahma vasettha what do you think of his if that be so are not the words of the brahmanas versed in the three vedas without substance gotama if that be so the words of the brahmanas versed in the three vedas are certainly without substance good vasettha then there should be no cause or reason for the brahmanas versed in the three vedas to declare the path without knowing or seeing it as leading one to be together with the brahma in these words “this is the straight path this is the direct path walking this path will certainly lead one to be together with the brahma the simile of the river aciravati settha take another simile suppose that the waters of the river aciravati were to rise up full to the brim facilitating crow to drink from the bank and that man should come up desiring to go to the other side of the river to get there to land there and to cross over to the opposite bank he were then to hallo hey farther bank come hither come to this side what do you think of this vasettha would the further bank of aciravati come over to this side by reason of that man calling out request prayer and solicitation gotama it would not just so the brahmanas versed in the three vedas give up the dhamma that paves the way to the state of brahmana and adopt that which goes against it and make the invocation “indra we call upon you soma we call upon you varuna we call upon you isana we call upon you pajapati tevijja sutta we call upon you brahma we call upon you mahiddhi we call upon you yama we call upon you there will be no reason for the brahmanas versed in the three vedas who give up the dhamma that paves the way to the state of brahmana and adopt that which goes against it to be together with the brahma on the death and dissolution of their bodies by reason of their calling out request prayer and solicitation vasettha take another simile suppose that the waters of the river aciravati were to rise up full to the brim facilitating crow to drink trom the bank and that man should come up desiring to go to the other side of the river to get there to land there to cross over to the opposite bank but he on this bank were to have his hands bound behind his back firmly with strong chains what do you think of this vasettha would that man be able to get to the farther bank of the aciravati from this bank gotama he would not just so there are in the discipline of the ariyds the five sensual pleasures which are like unto chains and fetters and what are these five they are visible objects cognizable by eye consciousness desirable delightful pleasing alluring associated with sensual attachment and enticing sounds cogni zable by ear consciousness odours cognizable by nose consciousness tastes cognizable by tongue consciousness ee tangible objects cognizable by body consciousness which are desirable delightful pleasing alluring associated with sen sual with sensual attachment and enticing vasettha in the discipline of the ariyas these five kinds of sensual pleasures are regarded as chains and fetters vasettha the brahmanas in the three vedas enjoy the five kinds of sensual pleasures clinging to them infatuated by them attached to them being blind to their faults and ignorant of the path of deliverance from suffering vasettha those brahmanas versed in the three vedas give up the dhamma that paves the silakkhandha vagga way to the state of brahma and adopt that which goes against it and there by get entangled with the chains and fetters of the five kinds of sensual pleasures which they enjoy clinging to them infatuated by them attached to them being blind to the evils of worldly life and ignorant of the path of deliverance from suffex sa there is therefore no reason for them to be together with the brahma on the death and dissolution of their bodies vasettha take another simile suppose that the waters of the river aciravati were to rise up full to the brim facilitating caw to drink from the bank and that man should come up desiring to go to the other side of il to get there to land there and to cross over to the bank but suppose he standing on this side would to sleep covering his head what do you think about this vasettha would that man be able to get to the farther bank of aciravati from this bank gotama he would not just so in the discipline of the ariyas there are five hindrances called masks obstacles bonds and entangle ments and what are these five hindrances they are hindranses of sensual desires kamacchanda hindrances of ill will byapada hindrances of sloth and torpor thinamiddha hindrances of restlessness and worry udddhacca kukkucca and hindrances of doubt vicikiccha vasettha in the discipline of the ariyas these five ‘hindrances are called masks obstacles bonds and entanglements vasettha these five hindrances have masked obstructed bound and entangled the brahmans versed in the three vedas vasettha as those brahmanas versed in the three vedas have given up the dhamma that paves the way to the state of brahmana and adopted that which goes against it and as the five hindrances have masked obstructed bound and entangled them there can be no cause of reason for them to be together with the brahma on death and the dissolution of their bodies tevijja sutta vasettha what do you think about this what have you heard from the brahmanas aged and well stricken in years who are the teachers of the people or teachers of the teachers of the people talking among themselves does the brahma take wife or does he not no gotama he does not beingwithout sensual de sires is his mind with enmity or without enmity without enmity gotama being without ill will is his mind with healthy or unhealthy healthy gotama being without sloth and torpor is his mind defiled or not defiled not defiled gotama being without restlessness and worry has he gained mastery over his mind or has he not he has gotama being without doubt vasettha what do you think of this do the brahmanas versed in the three vedas take wives or do they not they do gotama because they have sensual de sires are their minds with enmity or without enmity with enmity gotama because they have ill will are their minds healthy or unhealthy unhealthy gotama because they have sloth and torpor are their minds defiled or not defiled defiled gotama because they have restlessness and worry have they gained mastery over their minds or have they not they have not gotama because they have doubt vasettha you say that the brahmanas versed in the three vedas take wives while the brahma does not if that be so can the brahmanas versed in the three vedas and taking wives associate agreeably with the brahma not taking wife certainly not gotama good vasettha then vascttha there can be no reason for the brahmanas versed in the three vedas and taking wives to gain companionship on the death and dissolution of their bod ies with the brahma not taking wife vasettha you say that the brahmanas versed in the three vedas are with enmity in their minds while the brahma is without it vasettha you say that the brahmanas versed in the three vedas are unhealthy in mind while the brahma is healthy in mind vasettha you say that the brahmanas versed in the three vedas have defiled minds while the brahma mind is without defilement vasettha you say that the brahmanas versed in the three vedas have not gained mastery over their minds while the branma has if that“be so vasettha can the brahmanas versed in the three vedas who have not gained mastery over their minds associate agreeably with the brahma who has gaii zd mastery over his mind certainly not gotama good vasettha then vasettha there can be no cause or reason for the brahmanas versed in the three vedas who have gained no mastery over their minds to gain companionship with the brahma who has gained mastery over his mind vasettha those brahmanas versed in the three vedas holding the mistaken views that their practices would lead them to gain companionship with the brahma are sunk therein while thus sinking they are ruined verily they are swimming on dry land like the man who sees mirage so the there vedas of the brahmanas may be called jungle far from human habitation the three vedas may also be called deep forest without water and food the three vedas may also be called the way to ruination when this was said the young vasettha ad dressed the bhagava thus “f have heard gotama that samana gotama knows the path leading one to be together with the brahma tevijja sutta vasettha what do you think of this is the vallage of mansiakata near by and not far off from here gotama manasakata is near by not far off from here then what do you think of this vaseftha man born and brought up in the village of manasakata were to be asked the road to manasakata soon after he had left it vasettha when he were thus asked would that man born and brought up in manasakata be hesitant and perplexed to give the reply gotama he would not be hesitant or perplexed since oq gotama he knows all the roads leading to manasadkata village where he was born and brought up vasettha that man born and brought up in the village of manasakata might perchance have become hisitant and perplexed when he were asked about the roads around it but the tathagata on being asked about the brahma world or the path leading to the brahma world or the practice to realize the path leading to the brahma world would never hesitate or be perplexed to show the way vasettha know the brahma the brahma world and the path leading to the brahma world and also know the practice by which the brahma wor can be reached when this was said young settha addressed the bhagava thus “o gotama have heard that samana gotama declares the path leading one to be together with the brahma beg of the revered gotama to show us the path leading one to be together with the brahma may the revered gotama be kind enough to save the brahmana people vasettha if that be so listen well and pay good atten tion will speak “very well sir said young settha to the bhagava please see para samafifiaphala sutta silakkhandha vagga discourse on the way to the brahma world the bhagava said “vasettha there has appeared in this world the tathagata worthy of special veneration perfectly self enlightened p’ amplify as in the samafifiaphala sutta vasettha thus is the bhikkhu accomplished in morality ad that bhikkhu who realizes well that he has dispelled the five hindrances becomes gladdened in heart with gladness giving rise to delightful satisfaction piti with delightful satisfac tion generating bodily calm wiih bodily calm creating happiness sukha and with happiness bringing about the concentration of mind samadhi that bhikkhu dwells in state of mind filled with loving kindness that pervades the first region of the cardinal points and then the second and then the third and then the fourth and then everywhere above below and around thus does he dwell diffusing the entire world of sentient beings identified with himself with the mind conjoint with loving kindness extensive ever growing measureless free from hatred and free from ill will vasettha mighty blower of conch shell makes himself heard without difficulty in all the four directions if in like manner the freedom of mind filled with loveing kindness metta ceto vimutti cultivated diffused in all the ten directions its limited kamma actions pertaining to the realm of the senses can no longer remain with nor have foothold in that freedom of mind filled with loving kindness and this vasettha is the path leading to companionship with the brahma and again vasettha the bhikkhu dwells in state of mind filled with compassion please see para samajifiaphala sutta briefly it means that kamavacarakusala is limited in its operation before the attainment jhana after the attainment kamadvacarakusala kamma is replaced by ripavacara kusula kama which is replace of diffusing metta’ everywhere this leads one to be together with the brahma tevijja sutta and again vasettha the bhikkhu dwells in state of mind filled with sympathetic joy and again vasettha the bhikkhu dwells in state of mind filled with equanimity that pervedas the first quarter of the cardinal points and then the second and then the third and then the fourth and then everywhere above below or around thus does he dwell diffusing the entire world of sentient beings identified with himself with that mind conjoint with equanimity extensive ever growing measureless free from hatred and free from ill will vasettha mighty blower of conch shell makes himself heard without difficulty in all the four directions if in like maner the freedom of mind filled with equanimity upekkha ceto vimutti is cultivated and diffused in all the ten directions its limited kamma action pertaining to the sensuous sphere can no longer remain with nor have foothold in that freedom of mind filled with equanimity and this vasettha is the path leading one to be together with the brahm vasettha what do you think of this does the bhikkhu who dwells thus in that state of mind take wife or does he not he does not gotama being without sensual desires is his mind with enmity or without enmity without enmity gotama being without ill will is his mind healthy or unhealthy healthy gotama in the absence of sloth and torpor is his mind defiled or not difiled gotama being without restlessness and worry has he gained mastery over his mind or has he not he has gotama in the absence of doubt vasettha the bhikkhu as you say does not take wife and neither does the brahma then is not the bhikkhu not taking wife associate agreeably with the brahma not taking wife it is even so gotama good vasettha then there exists the cause or reason for bhikkhu not taking wife to be together with the brahma silakkhandha vagga also not taking wife on the death and dissolution of his body wasettha you say that the bhikkhu mind is without enmity and that the brahma mind is also without enmity vasettha you say that the bhikkhu is healthy and that the brahma mind is also healthy vasettha you say that the bhikkhu mind is not defiled and that the brahma mind is also not defiled vasettha you say that the bhikkhus has gained mastery owr his mind and that the brahma has also gained mastery over his mind if that be so does the bhikkhus mastery over his mind associate agreeably with the brahma mastery over his mind it does gotama good vasettha ther there exists the reason for the bhikkhu who has gained mastery over his mind to be together with the brahma who has also gained mastery over his mind on the dissolution of his body after death when this was said young asettha and young bharadvaja addessed the bhagava venerable sir excellent the dhamma ven sir excellent is the dhamma just as ven sir one turns up what lies upside down gotama just as one has uncovered what lies covered just as one shows the way to another who is lost just as one holds up lamp in the darkness for those who have eyes to see visible objects even so has friend

purest from and to make sure that the transliteration of the tiptaka in english romanization characters is precisely comleted introduction in siddhattha gotama was born he achieved the supreme status of the buddha at the age of he legt the luxious life as prince in such of the truth and attained nibbana in at the age of during his lifetime of years the fully englighentened one the buddha he incessantly went on tour teaching sutta abhidhamma and vinaya to all men and gods during the years of his lifetime the lord of buddha visited the north easternpart of india known as the middle region majjhimadesa sutta forms the guiding light for daily prac tice abhidhamma contains buddhist philosophy and psychology vinaya includes the principles laws and disciplines for monastic life long after the lord buddha left our world the dhamma sutta abhidhamma and vinaya still exist as guidence for mankind as long as we have them we can be assured that we still have our lord buddha with us the lord buddha taught what was right and wrong for the benefit of all mankind to prevent our sorrow and misery and to attain peace and tranqillity he taught the practice of dhamma sutta vinaya was taught for discipline and the tranquil co existence of fellow human beings and to promote the level of penetrative wisdom into the ultimate reality he taught us the abhidhamma the above three major teachings are collec tively known as the three pitakas” thus the pita kas have become our teacher our mentor and the lord buddha himself in fact they are likened to the invis ible presence of our lord buddha therefore those who hold the lord buddha in high esteem need to be well versed with the three pitakas three months after the parinibbana demise of the buddha the first council was held in rajagaha the convention was attended by supreme monks who had attained patisambhida ashin maha kassapa was the leader he expounded on three major points as follows those teachings dhamma and vinaya that the lord buddha had not taught should not be offered by monks those teachings dhamma and vinaya that the lord buddha had taught should not be deleted added nor edited by monks those teachings dhamma and vinaya that the lord buddha had taught should be followed by monks thus the knowledge belief and practice that strictly followed the dhamma and vinaya of the lord buddha were known as theravada which means school or teaching of the elders the second council was held in in vesali and was attended by seven hundred monks the leaders were sabbakami thera and yasa thera the third council took place in in pataliputta and was attended by one thousand monks the leader was tissa thera the first second and third conventions were held in india and were attended by indian monks only who were all arahats the fourth convention was held in sri lanka in and was attended by five hundred monks dhammarakkhita was the leader the difference between the previous conventions and this convention was that the monks had put the tipitaka in writing on palm leaves in the fifth ceremony was held in mandalay in myanmar was attended by monks and led by jagara thera the outstanding fact was that there was no sangayana for years between the fourth and fifth councils during the fifth conven tion the three pitakas were written on marble slabs it filled marble slabs each measuring six feet into four feet the fourth convention was conducted by sri lankan monks only and the fifth one was conducted by myanmar monks only the peculiar feature of the sixth convention was unamously participated by learned monks from five theravada countries and even from some mahayana countries most of the present day literature that attempts to explain the buddha’ teachings are merely the inter pretation of various authors and therefore they are secondary sources to the profound teaching it great loss for those who have not really tasted the genuine the essence of authentic teaching” therefore the sitagu internatonal buddhist academy has made its effort to romanise and translate the authentic three pitakas of the sixth convention and disseminated them worldwide for benefit of those who really want to know the essence of the dhamma sabbadanam dhammadanam jinau may the knowledge belief and practice of the truth shine forth in every corner of our world ashin nanissara mahadhammakathika bahujanahitadhara

nikaya the collection of long discourses of the buddha there are ten discourses in this book vagga they are mahapadana sutta mahanidana sutta mahaparinibbana sutta mahasudassana sutta janavasabha sutta mahagovinda sutta mahasamaya sutta sakkapanha sutta mahasatipatthana sutta and payasi sutta of these ten suttas mahanidana sutta mahaparinibbana sutta and mahasatipatthana sutta were included in the “ten suttas from digha nikaya the first book published by the myanmar pitaka association in the present book will cover all the ten suttas from the mahavagga including the above three mahapadana sutta great life histories of the past buddhas this discourse was given by the buddha while residing at the jetavana monastery to large number of bhikkhus in connexion with the knowledge of past existences pubbenivasanana on learning that the bhikkhus were keen to hear about this knowledge of past existences from him the bhagava delivered this discourse containing the great life histories of the past buddhas which he recollected with his supernormal psychic power the bhagava first gave brief account of the life histories of the seven buddhas that had arisen in the world at various world cycles he vividly recollected and clearly pre sented their names the world cycle in which they arose their lineage class and clan their life span the names of their parents the country in which they were born the bodhi tree where they attained enlighenment their chief disciples and the number of assemblies of disciples held during thier life time all these facts are given in the text only few interesting and significant facts will be mentioned here first concerning the time of the appearance of the buddhas in the ninety first world cycle counting back from the present one the buddha vv vi introduction vipassi arose in this world then in the thirty first world cycle counting back from the present one the buddhas sikhi and vessabhi arose in this world finally in the present badda world cycle the buddhas kakusandha konagamana kassapa and gotama buddha arose one after the other at long intervals of time the difference in the length of their life spans is also interesting and significant since the buddhas arose in the world only at very long intervals at different periods of time their life spans also varied thus the life span of vipassi was eighty thousand years that of sikhi was seventy thousand years that of vessabht was sixty thousand years that of kassapa was forty thousand years that of konagamana was thirty thousand years that of kakusandha was twenty thousand years and that of gotama buddha was only up to hundred years or little more than hundred years after giving brief sketch of the life histories of the past buddhas the bhagava left the assembly of the bhikkhus later in the evening there was second meeting of the bhagava with the bhikkhus there at that meeting the bhagava gave full account of the life of buddha vipassi starting from the time of conception in his mother’s womb his birth the bodily marks of great man on him his seeing the great omens an old man sick man dead man and recluse the renunciation of wordly life to the time of attainment of enlightenment setting the wheel of the dhamma and deliver ing discourses to human beings and to the brahmias in the brahma realms etc then the bhagava briefly related facts about the remaining buddhas including himself the gotama buddha thus the bhagava with his knowledge of past existences related all relevant facts about the past buddhas this sutta is therefore great life history of the buddhas buddha padana as such it is also referred to as “sutta raja mahanidana sutta this discourse was given by the bhagava while he was staying at the market town of kammasadhamma in the country introduction vil of kuru the subject of the discourse was the doctrine of dependent origination paticcasamuppada the bhagava deliv ered this discourse in response to statement made by the venerable ananda the venerable ananda had addressed the bhagava thus “venerable sir wonderful it is unprecedented it is this doctrine of paticcasammuppada is not only deep and profound it also has the signs or symptoms of being deep and profound but to my mind it seems to be evident and fathom able the bhagava then told him not to say so and delivered this discourse on dependent origination specifically to the ven ananda the bhagava said ananda because of lack of proper understanding and penetrative comprehension of this doctrine the minds of these beings are in state like that of snarled skein of yarn or that of blighted matted bird’s nest or that of munja grass or pabbaja grass and are unable to escape from the miserable ruinous realms of existence apaya or to escape from the round of existences samsara in this discourse the bhagava expounded the doctrine of paticcasamuppada in detail he also explained to his audience the deep and profound nature of the doctrine this doctrine deep and profound in four ways or aspects first it is deep and profound in its meaning atthagambhira the usage of pali language and the dhamma itself are deep and profound dhamma gambhira presentation of the doctrine also profound desana gambhira the facts laid down in the doctrine are deep and profound and should be known penetratingly and compre hensively as they lead one to nibbana pativedha gambhira the doctrine of dependent origination paticcasamuppada this doctrine an analysis of the nature of exist ence an exposition of causes of phenomena thus it shows if such and such cause present such and such an effect will follow if these causes are absent these effects will not arise it may also be noted that the cause of particular phenomenon or condition is itself the effect of some other phenomenon or condition the well known sequence of the doctrine usually starts with ignorance thus “because of ignorance avijja of vill introduction the four ariya truths volitional actions samkhara good or bad in deed word and thought were done by beings in the past existences because of their actions they become in the present existence human beings devas and brahmas with consciousness vifiiana mind and body namarupa six sense bases salayatana contact of sense organs with sense objects phassa sensation or feeling vedana and these beings take pleasure in long for crave for things or for existences itself tanha they cling to them upadana because of this craving and clinging they perform good or bad volitional actions again in their present existence kammabhava because of these actions they again will be reborn in the next existence jat will undergo old age and death jara marana thus suffering the whole gamut of dukkha in this sequence past present and future existences are linked together by this doctrine showing how the round of existences goes on and how through severing the cyclic chain the round of existences can be escaped from the above sequence is as given in the bodhi sutta udana pali khuddaka nikaya in the form in which the doctrine is discovered and contemplated by successive bud dhas in the mahanidana sutta the sequence starts with the question” what is the cause of ageing and death the latter part of the discourse deals with views on self ego etc atta the practice of insight meditation vipassana and various stages of release vimokkha from moral defile ments mahaparinibbana sutta mahaparinibbana sutta the third in the mahavagga of digha nikaya is strictly speaking not just discourse in fact it narrative account of the last year in the life of the buddha built around events leading to his realization of quotation from the article “comments on salient points in the mahanidana sutta” by myo min in the book “three fundamental concepts and comment on salient points in each sutta” companion book to “ten suttas from digha nikdya introduction ix parinibbana this sutta is the longest discourse of the digha nikaya and is divided into six portions in the text there is detailed account of the last jouney of the buddha starting from rajagaha and ending in kusinara the place where he realized parinibbana on the way the bhagava stopped at many places and delivered discourses dealing with fundamental and impor tant aspects of his teaching some examples of the buddha discourses are given below some important discourses discourse on factors of non decline apariya haniyadhamma of kings and princes the buddha delivered this discourse on the eve of his last journey while residing at rajagaha the sutta opens with the chief minister of magadha brahmana vassakara coming to see the bhagava and informing him about king ajatasatthu’s intention to attack and annihilate the vajji princes by way of answer the bhagava delivered the above discourse the seven factors of non decline of kings and princes are based on harmony and unity among them their respect esteem and veneration towards their elders towards their shrines their taking good care of the arahats and restraint from molesting women and maidens in conclusion the bhagava said “brahmin so long as these seven factors of non decline endure among the vajji princes and so long as the vajji princes observe and apply these seven factors thoroughly the furtherance of their prosperity their welfare is to be expected not its decline by this the chief minister of magadha understood that there was no possibility of king ajatasattu of magadha son of queen vedehi overcoming the vajji princes in battle then the minister and his party took leave of the bhagava and left discourse on factors of non decline of bhikkhus after the departure of the chief minister of magadha and his party the bhagava delivered the above discourse “factors of non decline of bhikkus” to the community of bhikkhus who were gathered in the assembly hall in rajagaha here the bhagava expounded six sets of seven factors of non decline of xx introduction bhikkhus these factors are based on harmony and unity among the community of bhikkhus on abandonment of sensual plea sures and sense desires having conviction saddha in the buddha dhamma and sangha having sense of shame and sense of fear to do evil hiri and ottapa cultivation of mindfulness cultivation of perception of impermanence suffer ing and non self cultivation of perception of cessation nirodha and cultivation of loving kindness metta about these factors also the bhagva said “so long as these factors endure and so long as the bhikkhus observe and apply these factors thor oughly the furtherance of their spiritual progress to be expected not its decline discourse on morality concentration and wisdom sila samadhi panna this discourse was expounded while the bhagava was sojourning at the gijjhakuta hill in rajagaha this discourse was repeated by the bhagavad at many places during his historic journey to kusinara the gist of the discourse is as follows “such is sila morality such is samadhi concentra tion such is pafiiia wisdom samadhi when based upon sila is rich in result and of great effect the mind when developed through paina is thoroughly liberated from the asavas viz kamasava bhavasava and avijjasava exposition of the four ariya truths the exposition of the four ariya truths was made by the bhagava during his stay at koti village with reference to the above the bhagava said to the bhikkhus “bhikkhus it is through not having proper understanding and penetrative com prehension of the four ariya truths as they really are that as well as yourselves have had to go incessantly through this long stretch of samsara round of existences that we have had to go through one life after another continuously later the bhagava said “bhikkhus have properly understood and penetratingly comprehended the four ariya truths as they really are and the bhava tanha craving for introduction xi existence which is like rope dragging one to renewed existence has been rooted out now there will be no more rebirth exposition of the “mirror of wisdom” dhammadasa the exposition of the mirror of wisdom was made by the bhagava during his stay at natika village the villagers wanted to know the destinations of their departed ones and came to ask the bhagavad but if the bhagava were to be approached every time person dies and asked about the matter destination or next existence of that person it would only be tiresome for him so the bhagava expounded this discourse on ‘mirror of wisdom” mirror of magga insight with this “mirror of wisdom” the ariya disciple will be able to assess and say of himself that he has become sotapanna who is not liable to fall into realms of misery and suffering that he is assured of good destination and of attaining the three higher levels of insight culminating in enlightenment on being one’s own firm support attadipadhamma this famous exhortation was given by the bhagava while he was spending his last residence period of the rains vassa at veluva village near vesali by that time the bhagava was quite ill but the bhagava warded off his illness by effort of vipassana bhavana and abided in the life sustaining phala samapatti the bhagava’s illness subsided he made the reso lution that he would live for the next ten months free of severe illness which would result in death he thereby postponed for ten months the time of his final passing away parinibbana during this period the bhagava made some memorable state ments and important exhortations here are some examples “ananda have set forth the teaching without any destinction of inner or outer doctrine the tathagatas ananda in the matter of their teaching do not hold any secret in the closed fist of teacher do not keep back anything ii ananda am now frail old aged far gone in years introduction and in the last stage of life have reached the eightieth year just as ananda worn out old cart is held together merely by bindings and repairs so the body of the tathagata is held merely by the force of phala samapatt iii “therefore ananda let yourselves be your own firm support and let yourselves and not anyone or anything else be your refuge let the dhamma the teaching be your own firm support and let the dhamma and not anything else be your refuge the bhagava has also shown how dbhikkhu disciple can make himself his own firm support how he can make the dhamma his own firm support and refuge the way to do it is to practice steadfast mindfulness to keep one’s mind steadfastly on the body kaya on sensation vedana on mind citta and on the dhamma with diligence comprehen sion and mindfulness thirty seven elements of the perpetuation of the teach ing bodhipakkhiya dhamma while the bhagava was staying at the pinnacled hall of mahavana forest all the bhikkhus staying in vesali were summoned to gather in the assembly hall to this assembly of bhikkhus the bhagava said to this effect “bhikkhus you should thoroughly learn pursue cultivate and continually prac tise the doctrine which have perceived through magga insight and which have expounded to you if you do so the teaching will endure long and will remain established for long time for the welfare and happiness of mankind for the sake of the world for the benefit well being and happiness of devas and men the doctrines referred to here are the four methods of steadfast mindfulness satipatthana the four supreme efforts sammappadhana the four bases of psychic potency iddhipada the five faculties indriya the five powers balas the seven factors of enlightenment bojjhanga and the ariya path of introduction xill fight constituents ariya atthangika magga discourse on four great authorities mahapadesa the bhagava delivered this discourse while he was stay ing at the town of bhoga this was after the bhagava’s decision to give up life sustaining mental process earlier while at the capala shrine the bhagava had decided mindfully and deliberately to give up the life sustaining mental process by not re entering into phalasammapatti after three mouths in this discourse the bhagava gave directives for deciding the authenticity of statements attributed to the buddha he told the bhikkhus that such statements words and phrases should not be immediately received with approval nor should they be immediately rejected with scorn without approval or rejec tion those words and phrases attributed to the buddha should be carefully noted and should be collated with the sutta and examined in the light of the vinaya last days of the tathagata even on his death bed the bhagava continued to give instruction answered questions and also received subhadda the wandering ascetic to help him find solution to problem to ananda the bhagavad pointed out the four places arousing apprehension of the nature of impermanence the four are lumbini the place where the tathagata was born mahabodhi the place where the tathagata attained supreme enlightenment migadayavana the place where the tathagata set the wheel of truth dhamma rolling expounded the dhammacakka pavattana discourse and kusinara the place where the tathagata passed into the ultimate peace of anupadisesa nibbana which is the complete cessation of all the five khandhas the bhagava also answered the question put up by the venerable ananda such question as how to conduct oneself with regard to women what should be done to the body the remains of the tathagata etc subhadda the wandering ascetic while staying at kusinara heard that the parinibbana of samana gotama would take place on that day in the last watch of the night and he felt that introduction somehow he must see the bhagavad to remove an uncertainty regarding the true doctrine the bhagavad discoursed to him on the true doctrine dhamma containing the anya path of eight constituents subhadda was delighted and rejoiced at what the bhagava said he took refuge in the buddha the dhamma and the samgha he also asked to be admitted and was admitted to the order as bhikkhu this indeed selfless and benevolent act on the part of the bhagava last words of the tathagata on the eve of his passing away parinibbana the bhagava said to the venerable ananda “do not think ‘the doctrine is bereft of the teacher of the doctrine our teacher no more ananda the doctrine and discipline have taught and laid down to all of you will be your teacher when am gone the bhagava also addressed the bhikkhus thus “o bhikkhus if any bhikkhu should happen to have any uncertainty or perplexity regarding the buddha the dhamma or the sam gha or magga or the practice then bhikkhus ask me questions do not iet yourselves feel regret later with the thought that even though our teacher was with us in our very presence we were not able to ask him questions personally in return this invitation for questions was repeated three times but the bhikkhus were silent after thus ascertaining that there was no uncertainty or perplexity in the community of bhikkhus regarding the bud dha or the dhamma or the samgha or magga or the practice the bhagava spoke these famous last words bhikkhus say this now to you “all conditioned and compounded things san khara have the nature of decay and disintegration with mindfulness endeavour diligently to complete the task the passing away parinibbana of the tathagata then as the assembled bhikkhus princes and the people paid homage to him with deep reverence and veneration the tathagata passed away realizing nibbana sakka king of the introduction xv devas the devas and the brahmas also came to pay homage to the tathagata

amongst devas human beings and other groups of beings there are hatred violence enmity and distress al though they wished to live without them the bhagava explained to him that this was on account of envy and stinginess issa and macchariya he further explained that envy and stinginess are caused by likes and dislikes piya appiya which in turn are caused by desire chanda the origin of desire is initial application of the mind vitakka which in turn has its origin in the group of perception that prolongs samsara the round of existences papafica safna sankha after answering the above the bhagava showed sakka and his company of devas course of practice leading to nibbana wherein the group of perception that prolongs sam sara ceases sakka was delighted and very much satisfied with what

up with the following passage ““bhikkhus this the one and only way for the purification of the minds of beings for overcoming sorrow and lamentation for the complete destruction of physical pain and mental distress for attain ment of the noble anya magga and for the realization of nibbana that only way is the practice of the four methods of steadfast mindfulness satipatthana this briefly states the advantages or benefits to be gained from the practice of mindfulness meditation the four methods of steadfast mindfulness are keeping one’s mind steadfastly on the body kaya on sensation vedana on the mind citta and on the dhamma there are fourteen ways of contemplating the body nine ways of contem plating sensation sixteen ways of contemplating the mind and five ways of contemplating the

governor payasi held the view that “there no other world that there is no rebirth of beings after death that there is no fruit or resultant introduction of good or bad deeds the venerable kumara kassapa made him see that his view was quite wrong and showed him the right path illustrating his teaching with numerous similes or examples his first example to illustrate the existence of other worlds was the example of the moon and the sun his next example was that of thief this example was given to illustrate that there is fruition and resultant of good and bad deeds that man was severely punished for offences and crimes committed by him other examples given included man in an excreta pit man born blind pregnant brahmini woman red hot ball of iron dream etc all these examples were given with view to correcting the wrong view of governor payasi eventually payasi gained the right view samma ditthi and took refuge in the buddha the dhamma and the samgha then the venerable kumara kassapa made an exposition on suffering where he dealt with offerings in which oxen goats pigs and fowls were slain such practice is that of the holders of wrong view and not of holders of right view in conclusion the venerable kumara kassapa pointed out the nght way to make offerings the right way to make offerings is as follows “give offerings with due respect give with your own hands give with enthusiasm do not give as if discarding them only such offerings are of great benefit and of great advantage thus the buddha has taught the dhamma in various ways for the welfare and benefit of all beings especially of mankind and for the perpetuation of his teaching he has taught the dhamma even with his last breath from his death bed it is our duty to follow his instructions closely and respectfully and to be always mindful of these last words of the buddha ‘all conditioned and compounded things sankhara have the nature of decay and disintegration” with mindfulness endeavour diligently to complete the task ”’ may the buddha teaching shine forth like the radiant sun the editorial committee department for the promotion and propagation of the sdasana ministry of religious

concerning things never heard of before then after some time bhikkhus the future buddha vipass dwelled in deep and repeated contemplation of the arising and cessation of the five aggregates that are the objects mah apadana sutta of clinging thus “such is corporality riipa such is the arising of corporality such is the cessation of corporality such is sensation vedana such is the arising of sensation such is the cessation of sensation such is perception safifia such is the arising of perception such is the cessation of perception such are volitional activities sankhara such is the arising of voli tional activities such ts the cessation of the volitional activities such consciousness viffiana such is the arising of con sciousness such the cessation of consciousness the mind of the future buddha vipassi dwelling in con templation of the arising and cessation of the five aggregates which are the objects of clinging soon was rid of such clinging and became liberated from the asavas end of the second chapter chapter iii supplication by brahma bhikkhus then to vipassi the exalted one the hom age worthy the perfectly self enlightened occured the thought “tt would be well if should expound the truth bhikkhus vipassi the exalted one the homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened again thought thus “this dhamma have realised is indeed profound it is difficult to perceive difficult to grasp thoroughly it is tranquil it is lofty it is beyond intellection it is subtle it can be comprehended only by the wise these beings are devoted to the things to which they cling they take delight in the things to which they cling they are very much pleased with the things to which they cling it will be difficult for these beings devoted to delighting in and very pleased with the things to which they cling to perceive this doctrine of paticca samuppada the doc trine of conditioned and conditioning factors it will also be difficult for them to perceive this nibbana the calming of all volitional activities sankhara the forsaking of substrata of exist ence on which dukkha rests the extermination of craving the absence of attachment cessation of dukkha since it is so even should expound the truth if others would not know or maha vagga understand my teaching it will only result in my being ex hausted and fatigued further bhikkhus these marvellous verses never heard of or known before come into the mind of vipassi the exalted one the homage worthy the perfactly self enlightened it is not proper that the dhamma to which have attained with difficulty be now made known those who are overwhelemed by attachment and hatred will not be able to understand this dhamma easily “those who are covered by the darkness of ignorance and infatuated with lust will not be able to perceive the subtle and profound dhamma which is as hard of being seen as particle of the atom and which goes against the current’ of the round of existance ”’ bhikkhus repeatedly considering thus the mind of vipassi the exalted one the homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened was not inclined to expound the truth and was inclined to remain unconcerned then bhikkhus certain great brahma came to be aware in his mind of these considerations of vipassi the exalted one the homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened and this thought came into the brahma mind “friends indeed the world is lost friends indeed the world is lost the mind of vipassi the exalted one the homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened is not inclined to expound the dhamma but ts inclined to remain unconcerned then bhikkhus just as strong man might instantaneously straighten his bent arm or instantaneously might bend his stretched arm that great brahma instantaneously vanished from the realm of the brahmas and appeared before vipassi the exalted one the homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened then bhikkhu the great brahma placing his upper garment on one shoulder against the current patisotagamim the above rendering follows the burmese version which interpolates of samsara “the commentary says the buddha dhamma was against the current of prevaling beliefs in nicea permanence sukhu lasting and satisfactory happiness atta soul and ego and subha pleasurableness of phenomena by propounding anicca impermance dukkha suffering and unsatisfactoriness anatta non soul and asubha repulsiveness of phenomena mahdapadana sutta resting his right knee on the ground and making obeisance with his joined plams raised addressed vipassi the exalted one the homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened thus “venerable sir may it please the exalted one to expound the dhamma may it please the sugata to expound the dhamma there are beings with little dust of defilement in their discerning eyes it will be great loss to beings for not having heard the dhamma there will be those who understand the dhamma when this was said bhikkhus vipassi the exalted one the homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened said to the great brahma thus “brahma also had the thought that it would be well to expound the dhamma brahma on the other hand these thoughts occured to me ‘this dhamma have realized is indeed profound it is difficult to perceive difficult to grasp thoroughly it is tranquil it is excellent it is beyond intellection it subtle it can be comprehened only by the wise these beings are devoted to the things to which they cling they take delight in the things to which they cling they are very much pleased with the things to which they cling it will be difficult for these beings devoted to delighting in and very much pleased with things to which they cling to perceive this doctrine of paticcasamuppada the doctrine of conditioned and conditioning factors it will be difficult for them to perceive this nibbana the calming of all volitional activities sankharas the forsaking of substrata of existance on which dukkha rests the extermination of craving the absence of attachment cessation of dukkha since it so even should expound the dhamma if others would not know or understand my teaching it will only result in my being exhausted and fatigued “c brahma also these marvellous verses never heard or known before came into my mind ‘it is not proper that the dhamma to which have attained with difficulty be now made known those who are overwhelmed by attachment and hatred will not be able to understand this truth easily maha vagga those who are covered by the darkness of ignorance and infatuated with lust will not be able to perceive the subtle and profound dhamma which is as hard of being seen as particle of the atom and which goes against the current of the round of existence ”’ bhikkhus the great brahma repeated for the second time for the third time what he had said to vipassi the exalted one the homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened thus “venerable sir may it please the exalted one to expound the dhamma may it please the sugata to expound the dhamma there are beings with little dust of defilements in their discening eyes it will be great loss to those beings for not having heard the dhamma there will be those who understand the dhamma ”’ then bhikkhus vipassi the exalted one the homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened took cognizance of the entreaty of the great brahma and motivated also by his compassion on all beings surveyed the world of sentient beings with the eye of buddha bhikkhus vipassi the exalted one the homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened on thus surveying the world of sentient beings found that there were beings who had little dust of defilements in their discerning eyes beings who had great deal of dust of defilements in their discerning eyes beings with developed faculties beings with as yet undeveloped faculties beings with good attributes beings with bad attributes beings capable of easy comprehension and beings incapable of easy comprehension of what is expounded he also found some beings who were given to contemplation of the fault of future existence as danger as well as some beings who were not given to such contemplation to illustrate in clumps of the uppala lotus or of the paduma lotus or of the pundarika the eye of buddha buddha cakkhu includes indriya paropartyatti hana knowldge of the acuteness and dullness of beings asayanusaya fiana knowledge of inclination and disposition of beings mahapadana sutta lotus in pond some of these lotus plants are generated in the water and grow in the water without ever rising out of the water but thriving under the surface some are generated in the water and grow in the water reaching to the surface level of the water other lotus plants are generated in the water grow in the water and raise above the surface level of the water without being stained with defiled by the water so also bhikkhu when vipassi the exalted one the homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened thus surveyed the world of sentient beings with the eye of the buddha he found that there were beings who had little dust of defilements in their descerning eyes beings who had great deal of dust of defilements in their discerning eyes beings with developed intellectual faculties beings with as yet undeveloped faculties beings with good attributes beings with bad attributes beings capable of easy comprehension and beings incapable of easy comprehension of what is expounded he also found some beings who were given to contemplation of the fault of future existences as danger as well as some beings who were not given to such contemplation then bhikkhu that great brahma became aware in his mind of the thoughts of vipassi the exalted one the homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened and addressed vipassi the exalted one the homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened reciting these verses “cq perfectly wise one possessor of the eye of all round knowledge perfected in wisdom just as man standing on high rocky mountain may observe men below and on all sides in the same way the exalted one himself rid of all anxiety and grief ascend the palace turret of dhamma and observe all those beings fallen into anxiety and grief overwhelmed and oppressed by birth and decay exalted one of great diligence arise victorious one by whom the battle’ has been won arise exalted one caravan leader one free from the debt of defilements wander round the world exalted one may you expound the doctrine of truth there uppala lotus red white or dark blue paduma lotus predominantly red though it may be of four other colours pundarika lotus white maha vagga will be these who understand the teaching bhikkhus thereupon vipassi the exalted one the homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened replied to the great brahma in these verses “oq brahma had been disinclined to expound the sublime and well practised dhamma to men thinking that it would only mean exhaustion and fatigue for me now have opened the doors to nibbana let those with ears of knowledge give forth their faith then bhikkhus knowing that the buddha vipassi the exalted one the homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened had assented to expound the dhamma that great brahma made obeisance and paid homage to vipassi the exalted one the homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened and vanished then and there the pair of chief disciples then bhikkhus to the vipassi the exalted one the homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened this thought occured “to whom should expound the dhamma first who will understand this dhamma quickly then bhikkhus vippassi the exalted one the homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened further had this thought “the prince named khanda and the son of the king brahmanic head priest named tissa are living in the capital city bandumati they are sagacious learned and intelligent for long they have had little dust of defilements in their discerning eyes it would be well if were to expound the dhamma to khanda the prince and

from debt banana without new birth which would he owe to kamma made obeisance lit reverentially saluting paid homage padakkhinam katva by going round with his right side to the buddha na mahapadana sutta first they will be able to understand this dhamma quickly then bhikkhus as instantaneously as strong man straightens his bent arm or bends his stretched arm vipassi the exalted one the homage worthy the perfectly self enlight ened vanished from the foot of the bodhi tree and appeared in the deerpark known as khema’ near the capital city bandhumati then vipassi the exalted one the homage worthy the perfectrly self enlightened called the grove keeper and said “o grove keeper go you to the capital city bandhumati and say to khanda the prince and tissa the head priest son this sirs vipassi the exalted one the homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened has reached bandhumati the capital city and is dwelling in the deer park named khema he wishes to see you sirs bhikkhus the grove keeper said “very well venerable sir and entered the capital city bandhumati and said to khanda the prince and tissa the head priests son “sirs repeated as above sirs then bhikkhus the prince khanda and the head priest son tissa had excellent and elegant carriages harnessed and riding in the excellent and elegent carriages left the capital city bandhumati for the khema deer park they went in the carriges as far as the carriages should properly go and then descending from the carriages went on foot and approached vipassi the exalted one the homage worthy the perfectly self enlight ened

perfectly self enlightened gave the following discourses in successive order namely the discourse on charity discourse on morality discourse on the celestial realms discourse on the fault of sensual

expounded by the buddhas themselves in this exposition the bhagava revealed the truth of suffering dukkha the origin samudaya of dukkha the cessation nirodha of dukkha and the path magga leading to the cessation of dukkha just as piece of pure white cloth unsoiled by dust would readily take in the dye even so prince khanda and the head priest son tissa realized on that very spot the truth that all phenomena that have the nature of arising coming into being do have the nature of cessation disappearing and thus attained the faultless and undefilled “eye of the truth’ dhamma cakkhu or sotapatti magganana prince khandha and the head priest son tissa having seen the truth having attained the truth having gained insight into it having plunged into it having overcome doubt having become free of vacillation having gained the courage of convic tion and not having faith in teaching other than the buddha they addressed vipassi the exalted one the homage worthy the perfectly self

bhikkhus this the tathagata himself has penetrating discernment of the principle underlying knowledge of past exist ences the principle which leads to the power of recall due to this penetrating discernment the tathagata can recollect the facts relating to the buddhas of the past the buddhas who had done away with the factors that prolong sam sara and who had cut off the course of rebirth who had ended the round of existence who had overcome all the ills of existence and who had realized the complete nibbana and he can recall the facts about these buddhas by birth by name by clan by their life span by the pairs of excellent disciples by assemblies of their disciples saying such was the birth such was the name such was the clan such was the moral ity such was the concentration such was

seating him self on one side addressed the bhagava thus venerable sir wonderful it is unprecedented it is this doctrine of paticca samuppada is not only deep and profound it also has the signs of being deep and profound but to my mind it seems to be evident and fathomable ananda say not so ananda say not so this doctrine of paticca samuppada is not only deep and profound it also has the signs of being deep and profound ananda because of lack of proper understanding and pen etrative comprehension of this doctrine the minds of these beings are in state like that of snarled skein of yarn or that of blighted matted bird nest or that of mufija grass or pabbaja grass and are unable to escape the miserable ruious realms of existence apaya or to escape from the round of existences samsara ananda shuld it be asked if there is cause for the occurrence of ageing’ and death jara and marana the answer has paticca samuppada dependent origination some use the terms ‘condi tioned genesis’ law of cause and effect’ ‘chain of causation mufija and pabbaja grass grass like fine thatch which when processed like jute could be made into twine when this twine was entangled it became difft cult to

misleading term as it carries spatial connotation ageing jara commonly translated as old age maha vagga to be that there again if it be asked what the cause of ageing and death is the answer has to be that ageing and death are due to jati new existence ananda should it be asked if there is cause for the occur rence of jati coming into new existence the answer has to be that there again if it be asked what the cause of jati is the answer has to be that jati is due to bhava the kammic causal process ananda should it be asked if there is cause for the occur rence of bhava the answer has to be that there is again if it be asked what the cause of bhava the answer has to be that bhava is due to upadana clinging ananda should it be asked if there is cause for the arising of upadana clinging the answer has to be that there ts again if it be asked what the cause of clinging the answer has to be that clinging is due to tanha craving ananda should it be asked if there is cause for the arising of tanha craving the answer has to be that there again if it be asked what the cause of tanhd the answer has to be that tanha due to vedana sensation ananda should it be asked if there is cause for the arising of vedana sensation the answer has to be that there again if it be asked what the cause of vedana is the answer has to be that vedand is due to phassa contact ananda should it be asked if there is cause for the arising of phassa contact the answer has to be that there is again if it be asked what the cause of phassa is the answer new existence jati commonly translated as birth bhava as the cause of jati is the causal process of kamma or volitional activities in the course of this life bhava as the result of upadana is existence tanha lit thirst fig mental thirst which becomes craving fever of unsatisfied longing for various kinds of objects or sensations there are three aspects of tanha viz kamatanhd craving for pleasures of the senses bhavatanha craving for rebirth especially rebirth in higher realms and vibhavatanha craving for annihilation of self the six forms of the first aspect are listed in para phassa means the coming together of the sense base sense object and con sciousness maha nidana sutta has to be that phassa due to namaripa mind and body ananda should it be asked if there is cause for the arising of namarupa mind and body the answer has to be that there is again if it be asked what the cause of namariipa is the an swer has to be that namaripa is due to vififiana birth linking consciousness ananda should it be asked if there is cause for the arising of viinana birth linking consciousness the answer has to be that there is again if be asked what the cause of vwififfana birth link ing consciousness the answer has to be that vififiana is due to namarupa thus ananda namaripa conditions the arising of vififiana birth linking consciousness’ vififiana conditions the arising of namaripa namaripa conditions the arising of phassa phassa con ditions the arising of vedana vedana conditions the arising of tanha tanha conditions the arising of upadana upadana conditions the arising of bhava bhava conditions the arising of jati jati condi tions the arising of ageing death grief lamentation pain distress and despair in this way occurs the arising of that entire sum total of dukkha the entire aggregate of suffering pain affliction im perfection impermanence emptiness insubstantiality unsatisfactoriness which are identified with the five khandha ag gregates ananda have said that jara marana ageing and death are conditioned by jati this point how jara marana arise through jati can be understood by means of the following method of rea soning suppose ananda jati does not occur at all or in any way to namaripa is to be understood as the complex of mental and physical phe nomena it will be noticed that here phassa contact is conditioned by namaripa not mentioning salayatana the six fields of sense perception the six sense bases the commentary explains that this is because the bud dha wanted to emphasize that nadmaripa is the complete primary source of contact and that the cause of contact is not restricted to the six sense bases another way of putting this and the following sentences would be “condi tioned by arises” rt maha vagga any being in any realm of existence to amplify this let us say for instance if jati does not occur to devas to become devas nor to gandhabbas to become gandhabbas nor to yakkhas to become yakkhas nor to beings bhata with visible forms to become such beings nor to human beings to become human beings nor to four legged beings to be come four legged beings nor to birds to become birds nor to be ings that creep and crawl to become beings that creep and crawl if ananda jati does not occur to these various beings to become be ings in their respective realm of existence that if jati altogether abosulutely does not occur then due to the non occurrence of jati can jara marana appear at all venerable sir they cannot appear at all therefore ananda only this jati is the cause of the source of the origin of and the condition for jara marana ananda have said that jati is conditioned by bhava this point how jati arises through bhava can be understood by means of the following method of reasoning suppose ananda bhava does not occur at all or in any way for any being in any realm of existence to amplify this let us say for instance if bhava does not occur at all in any of the three states of existence namely kamabhava ripabhava and ariipabhava then due to the non ier that suppose there no birth anywhere in way and the following para graph may be roughly paraphrased as if no devas gandhabbas yakkhas bhitas human beings etc etc are born in any realm or if there is no birth of devas etc etc etc at all gandhabbas devas who belong to the lowest catumaharajika deva realm and who are noted musicians and entertainers yakkhas sometimes roughly translated as “demons demon spirits “ge nit’ or wrongly ogres yakkhas are non human beings the term yakkha is used with widely varying attributes and connotations throughout the pali canon ranging from the pleasant to the hideous non occurrence nirodha cessation of the repeated phenomenon of birth the term bhava has two main meanings besides few supplementary others kmma bhava the kammic process cosisting of rebirth producing volitions and the mental phenomena associated therewith upapatt bhava the kammic resultant rebirth process in three states of existence maha nidana sutta occurence of bhava can jjati appear at all venerable sir jati cannot appear at all therefore ananda only this bhava is the cause of the source of the origin of and the condition for jati ananda have said that bhava is conditioned byupadana clinging this point how bhava arises through upadana can be understood by means of the following method of reasoning suppose ananda upadana does not arise at all or in any way in any being in any realm of existence if there is no clinging of any kind by anyone to anything to amplify this let us say for instance if upadana does not arise at all in any of its forms viz clinging to sense desires sensuality kamupadana clinging to false doctrines of erroneous views and opinions ditthupadana clinging to practices of and be lief in mere rules and rituals not leading to the right path silabbatupadana and clinging to soul theortes to theories that there is self soul ego attavadupadana then due to the non oc currence of upadana can bhava appear at all venerable sir bhava cannot appear at all therefore ananda only this upadana is the cause of the source of the origin of and the condition for bhava ananda have said that upadana clinging is condi tioned bytanha craving this point how upadana arise through tanha craving can be understood by means of the following method of reasoning suppose ananda tanha does not arise at all or in any way in any being in any realm of existence to amplify this let us say for instance if tanha does not arise at all in any of its six forms namely craving for enjoyment the three states of existence are kamabhava the state of sensual existence comprising the eleven realms of sense desire state of existence dominated by pleasures of the senses this of course implies also corporeal existence riipabhava the state of existence with fine materiality comprising six teen of the realms of the brahmas the upper celestial beings aripabhava the state of non corporeal or formless non material ex istence comprising fouf of the realms of the upper brahmas maha vagga of visible objects ripatanha craving for enjoyment of sounds saddatanha craving for enjoyment of smell gandhatanha crav ing for enjoyment of tastes or flavours rasatanha craving for enjoyment of physical contact photthabbatanha craving for plea sure of ideas thoughts dhammatanha’ then due to the non occur rence of tanha can upadana appear at all venerable sir upadana cannot appear at all therefore ananda only this tanha craving is the cause of the source of the origin of and the condition for upadana clinging ananda have said that tanha craving is conditioned by vedana sensation this point how tanha arises through vedana sensation can be understood by means of the following method of reasoning suppose ananda vedand does not arise at all or in any way in any being in any realm of existence to amplify this let us say for instance if vedana does not arise at all or in any way either through contact by means of the eye by seeing or through contact by means of ear by hearing or through contact by means of the nose by the smelling or through contact by means of the tongue by the sens of taste or through contact by means of the body by touching or through contact by means of the mind by the faculty of the mind having contact with mind objects such as thoughts ideas then due to the non occurrence of vedana can tanha appear at all venerable sir tanha cannot appear at all therefore ananda only this vedana sensation is the cause of the source of the origin of and the condition for tanha craving thus ananda because of vedand there arises tanha rpatanha craving for ripa riipa has many shades of meaning briefly it may be rendered as materiality material factor matter physical phenom enon physical substance dhammatanha craving for dhamma mind objects ideas thoughts con cepts are sense objects of the faculty of mind vedana has been rendered by some as feeling tanha the commentary says there are two kinds of tanha craving vattamula tanha craving leading to the round of existence this is the general aspect of craving samudacara tanha craving in actual conduct and practice this is the maha nidana sutta because of tanha there arises quest for possessions pleasures pariyesana because of quest there arises getting gaining jabha because of getting gaining there arises the process of decision on how to

craving are enlaged upon the chain of causal factors inter rupted here by these ten paragraphs is taken up again in para —t chanda raga chanda impulse excitement desire for wish for delight in something raga passion lust therefore in this context chanda raga means passion for and delight in possessions etc chanda raga is weaker pas sion than tenacious cleaving to possessions ajjhosana rendered in the burmese version as firm determination that what has been gained is one very own pariggaha holding on to seizing grasping on to carefully keeping posses sions acquisitiveness” or gloating over what has been got are other possible renderings macchariya stinginess selfishness not wishing to share with others thus jealously holding on to what one has lit carrying sticks bearing weapons quarrelling viggaha lit going against one another maha vagga this point how these many wicked demeritorious acts such as hitting with sticks wounding with weapons fighting quarrelling contentiously disputing using unbearable expressions backbiting and telling lies arise through watchful guarding of possessions can be understood by this means suppose ananda there is no watchful guarding of posses sions at all or in any way by any being in any realm of existence if there is entirely no such watchful guarding then due to the ab sence of such watchful guarding can these many wicked demeritorious acts such as hitting with sticks wounding with weap ons fighting quarrelling contentiously disputing using unbear able expressions backbiting and telling lies occur at all ‘“ venerable sir they cannot occur at all therefore ananda only this watchful guarding of posses sions is the cause of the source of the origin of and the condition for the arising of these many wicked

of meanness and stingi ness there arises watchful guarding of possessions this point how meanness and stinginess gives rise to watchful guarding of possessions can be understood by this means suppose

viifiiana and namardpa the cycle of existences turns round and round through just these mutually conditioning vififdna and namarupa there arises what designated as the five khandha aggregates definition of atta ananda how does person who believes in atta self soul ego define atta ananda the person who believes in atta as having coporeality and limitedness would define it by saying my atta

either one who de fines coporeal and limited atta only of this existence or one who defines coporeal and limited atta of future existences also person the buddha in the following paragraphs points out four kinds of persons who believe in the soul and who define it variously according to their conception of what the soul who believes in pafifiapento lit who designates something as atta the commentary says that these four definitions are deductions made by some persons who practise kasina meditation only of this existence here the buddha is distinguishing between two kinds of wrong views regarding existence one is the view that there is merely this existence this is uccheda ditthi the doctrine of the annihilation of the soul the other view is that the soul continues in other existences this is sassata ditthi the doctrine of the eternal continuance of the soul after death and the person who holds either view is firmly convinced that the person who has the other view is on the wrong track believing what is untrue and that it behoves him to put the other right to make the other realize what is true both are wrong views maha vagga either of the two thinks shall put right the wrong view of the other” ananda this being so it is proper to say that the wrong view termed rapiparittattanuditthi the belief in atta with coporeality and limitedness persists in the mind of that person ananda of these four persons he who believes in atta as having coporeality but no limitedness may be either one who defines coporeal and unlimited atta only of this existence or one who defines coporeal and unlimited atta of future existences also either of the two thinks ‘“ shall put right the wrong view of the other” ananda this being so it is proper to say that the wrong view termed rapianantattanuditthi the belief in atta coporeality and un limitedness persists in the mind of that person ananda of these four persons he who believes in atta as having no coporeality but having limitedness may be either one who defines an incoporeal and limited atta only of this existence or one who defines an incoporeal and limited atta of future existences also either of the two thinks

proper to say that the wrong view termed arupianantattanuditthi the belief in atta with incoporeality and unlimitedness persists in the mind of that person ananda this how person who believes in aftta defines atta persists anuseti recurs again and again person here the buddha is describing persons who do not hold the atta theory maha nidana sutta gle non definition of atta ananda how does person who does not believe in atta self soul ego refrain’ from defining atta ananda the person who does not believe in atta as having coporeality and limitedness would make no such definition as my atta is corporeal and limited” ananda the second person who does not believe in atta as having coporeality but no limitedness would make no such defini tion as my atta is corporeal and unlimited”’ ananda the

this being so it is proper to say that the wrong view termed aripianantattanuditthi the belief in an incoporeal and un limited afta does not persist in the mind of that person ananda this is how person who does not believe in atta refrains from defining atta consideration of atta anand what does person who considers atta take atta to be ananda the person who considers vedana sensation as atta takes sensation as atta and believes sensation my atta ananda some other person who considers atta believes sensation is not my atta my atta cannot feel any mental phenom ena ananda still another person who considers atta believes sensation is not my atta and it is not that my atta cannot feel any cnnot feel any mental phenomenon here atta is identified with rapa or ripkkhandha the aggregate of physical phenomena or roughly the body if atta is the mere body it cannot experience or feel any sensation or any other mental phenomenon here in the case of the third person atta is identified with one or all of the three remaining khandhas namely safifiakkhandha aggregate of percep tion sankharakkhandha aggregate of volition or mental formations and vinfianakkhandha aggregate of consciousness the first person identifies atta with sensation the second person with body and the third person with one or all of the three factors of the mental make up other than sensation namely perception volitions and consciousness thus in the case of the third person he believes that affa can experience these three mental phe nomena maha nidana sutta mental phenomenan my atta can feel mental phenomenan my atta has the property of feeling mental phenomenon ananda of those three persons this should be said to the person who maintains that sensation is my atta” friend there are three kinds of sensation pleasant sensa tion unpleasant sensation and neither pleasant nor unpleasant neu tral sensation of these three kinds of sensation which do you consider to be atta ananda when pleasant sensation is felt neither unpleasant sensation nor neutral sensation can be lelt at that time only the pleasant sensatoin can be felt ananda when an unpleasant sensation is felt neither pleas ant sensation nor neutral sensation can be lelt at that time only the unpleasant sensatoin can be felt ananda when neutral sensation is felt neither pleasant sen sation nor unpleasant sensation can be lelt at that time only the neutral sensatoin can be felt ananda pleasant sensation is impermanent it is re sult produced by combination of causes it arises due to being conditioned by causal factors it has the nature of wasting away of disintegrating of disappearing of ceasing ananda an unpleasant sensation too is impermanent it is result produced by combination of causes it arises due to being conditioned by causal factors it has the nature of wasting away of disintegrating of disappearing of ceasing ananda neutral sensation too is impermanent it is result produced by combination of causes it arises due to being condi tioned by causal factors it has the nature of wasting away of disin tegrating of disappearing of ceasing while person is having pleasant sensation he entertains the belief this pleasant sensation is verily my atta” when that pleasant sensation disappears he will have to say my atta has perished when he is having an unpleasant sensation too he again entertains the belief ‘“ this unpleasant sensation is verily my atta” when that unpleasant sensation disappears he will have to say again my atta has perished when he is having neutral sensation too he again entertains the belief this neutral sensation verily ee result of causes sankhata formed maha vagga my atta” when that neutral sensation disappears he will have to say again my atta has perished thus the person who maintains that sensation my atta considers in effect that afta is in this very life impermanent is bued with pleasure and pain and has the nature of arising comong into existence and wasting away lit decaying therefore ananda the view that “‘ sensation is my afta” is not by the above demonstration fitting or proper ananda of those three persons this should be said to the person who maintains that sensation is not my afta my atta cannot feel any mental phenomenon ‘friend is it possible to consider purely physical thing which does not have the capacity for feeling any mental phenom enon as this verily is myself” ‘“‘ venerable sir it must be said that it is not possible therefore ananda the view that ‘“ sensation is not my atta my atta cannot feel any mental phenomenon” ts not by the above demonstration fitting or proper ananda of those three persons this should be said to the person who maintains that sensation is not my atta and it is not that my atta cannot feel any mental phenomenon my afta can feel mental phenomenon my afta has the property of feeling mental phenomenon’ friend if sensation in any form or of any kind were to ceas absolutely then in the complete absence of sensation would it be possible to consider the mental phenomena entirely free of sensa tion as this verily is myself’ venerable sir it must be said that it would not be possible therefore ananda the view that ‘‘ sensation is my afta and it is not that my afta cannot feel any mental phenomenon my atta can feel mental phenomenon ”’ my atta has the property of feel ing mental phenomenon” is not by the above demonstration fitting or proper ananda because of this the bhikkhu does not consider sensation atta nor does he consider that atta cannot feel any the mental phenomena of perception volition consciousness entirely without sensation because of its postulated complete cessation maha nidana sutta mental phenomenon nor does he consider that my atta can feel mental phenomenon my afta has the property of feeling mental phenomenon’ not considering like this that bhikkhu does not cling to any of the five khandhas because of this lack of clinging he does not crave for anything because he becomes devoid of crav ing he by himself will finally and completely become liberated from moral defilements he knows rebirth is no more for me the noble practice of the path leading to liberation has been car ried out what should be done has already been done and for this purpose attainment of magga there is nothing more to be done ananda should anyone say of the bhikkhu with such and emancipated mind that he holds the view that sentient being exists after death’ or that he holds the view that sentient being does not exists after death” or that he holds the view that sentient being exists and yet does not exist after death’ or that he holds the view that sentient being neither does exist nor does exist after death’ such saying would be improper and why would it be improper ananda whatever the extent there is of arbitrary nomencla ture and its basis the five khandhas of significanture term and its basis the five khandhas of honorific appellation and its basis the five khandhas of knowledge and intellect and its sphere of activity the five khandhas of the round of exist ences and its continual turning all that is completely and throughly known by the bhikkhu who is an arahat being emancipated from all moral defilements to say of such bhikkhu who is an arahat and who has been emancipated from all moral defilements that “he does not know he does not see he holds such and such view” is improper in deed ee crave paritassati lit long after something an arahat area thiti the place where vififina is or is sited the commentary explains thiti by patitthdna support base each

all the thirty one realms of existence some by implication though not mentioned which comprise the field of samsdara the cycle of existences ayatana in this context sphere field range the burmese

the consciousness of the previous vififianaficayatana jhana this realm asafifiasatta state without consciousness according to the commentary is one of the sixteen ripa realms nevasafifianasafifiayatana the realm of neither consciousness nor non consciousness that is without coarse or evident consciousness but not without excessively refined or tenuous consciousness scarcely discernible danger adinava also translated as fault disadvantage the danger inherent in it is due to its impermanence changeableness and concomitant dukkha what is said about the first area of vififidna applies to the remaining six areas maha vagga venerable sir it would not be proper ”’® ananda of those two ayatana spheres there is the sphere of beings devoid of sanna ananda would it be proper for person who knows that ayataa sphere who also knows how it comes into being also how it vanishes or disappears also its attractiveness also its danger and also how to get free of it for such person would it be proper to find pleasure in it ‘‘ venerable sir it would not be proper ananda of those two ayatana spheres there is the sphere of beings without coarse or evident saffa but not without refined tenous scarcely discernible safifa the realm of neither sanna nor non sanna ananda would it be proper for person who knows that ayataa sphere who also knows how it comes into being also how it van ishes or disappears also its attractiveness also its danger and also how to get free of it for such person would it be proper to find pleasure in it venerable sir it would not be proper ananda because of this the bhikkhu who is an arhant knows the origin the coming into being of these seven areas of winfana and these two ayatana spheres also their disappearance also their attractiveness also their danger and also how to get free of them and knowing them as they really are he is without attachment to them and thus is emancipated from kilesas moral defilments ananda such bhikkhu is called pafifiavimutta one who has attained emancipation who has become an arahat through magga insight eight stages of release ananda there are eight stages of release vimokkha these are release vimokkha freed of moral hindrances and defilements but not contempletely rooting them out freedom or release through jhana mental absorption not identical with the emancipation of an arahat as it is possible to fall from the shana state shana jhana is kind of mental culture usually translated mental absorption in which the mind is concentrated on objects such as kasina and in which the hindrances nivaranas are kept away from the mind the mind maha nidana sutta contemplating the kasina object in one’s own body and having attained the rupayhana the mental absorption in form and matter one contemplates also external forms and objects such as kasina objects this is the first release not paying attention to the kasina objects in one’s own body such as colour form and corporeal features one contemplates ex ternal kasina forms this is the second release one applies oneself to the brightness and clarity subha of the object of intense contemplation this is the third release by concentrating on the concept ‘space is infinite’ one achieves and remains in akasanaficayatana jhana where all forms of con sciousness that turn on corporeality ripasaffia have been com pletely transcended all forms of consciousness arising out of con tact between the senses and their objects patighasafia have van ished and other forms of consciousness many and varied nanattasanna are not paid attention to this is the fourth release by concentrating on the concept “consciousness is infinite’ one achieves and remains in vififanaficayatana shana having to tally gone beyond the jhana of the infinity of space this is the fifth release by concentrating on the concept “nothing there’ one achieves and remains in the akifisanfifiayatana jhana having totally gone beyond the jhana of the infinity of consciousness this is the sixth release one achieves and remains in the nevasafinanasannayatana jhana the jhana of neither saffid nor non safifia having totally gone beyond the jhana of nothingness this is the seventh release one achieves and remains in the sustained attainment of ces sation nirodha samapatti in which all forms of consciousness is ‘distanced’ from hindrances the kasina induced jhana is mundance or worldly jhana there are four riipavacara jhanas and four aripavacara jhanas the former can be practised to attain the sixteen fine material realms of the brahmas the object of intense contemplation in the first two states is kasina whether it is physical object internal to the body subjectively or external objectively or an after image resulting from prolonged fixation of consciousness on the actual kasina object fone maha vagga cease having totally gone beyond the jhana of neither sanna nor non saffa this is the eighth release ananda these are the eight stages of release ananda the bhikkhu enters upon and attains these eight stages of release in straightforward order and also in re verse order and also in straightforward and revers order forward and backward he repeatedly enters upon and remains in any shana at will anywhere at will for any pre determined length of time he also rises out of the shana at will because of the complete destruction of the asavas moral intoxicants or taints he realizes and attains by himself in the present life the taing free emancipation of the mind arahattaphala samadhi as well as the insight emancipation arahattaphala panna through magga in sight ananda such bhikkhu is called ubhatobhagavimutta one who is emancipated from all kilesas moral defilements and at tains arahatship being free in both ways ananda there is no other emancipation from moral defile ments in both ways that is loftier and moral excellent than this emancipation from moral defilements in both ways the bhagava gave this discourse ananda being delight with the discourse received it rejoicingly end of the mahanidana sutta the second sutta ubhatobhaga vimutta one who is emancipated in both ways there are five kinds of emancipation in both ways of these emancipation in both ways after the attainment of nirodha sam€patti is the loftiest and the most excellent in both ways ubhatobhaga lit both parts free both by the discipline of the eight stages of release and by insight wisdom the commentary says “both ways”means emancipation from material composite ripakaya is attained through the repeated arapa jhanas and

seven factors thoroughly the furtherance of their prosperity is to be expected not their decline then the brahmin vassakara chief minister of magadha replied thus to the bhagava “venerable gotama if the vajji princes are endowed with even single one of these factors of non decline the furtherance the arahats the commentry implies that here the term arahato arahats includes all ascetices who have left the home life mahaparinibbana sutta of their welfare and prosperity is to be expected not their decline how much more so if they should be endowed with all the seven factors “venerable gotama

structing the devotees of patali village in the teaching causing them to realize the benefits of the dhamma to become estab lished in the observance of the teaching and to be filled with gladness and enthusiasm for the practice of the teaching then he sent them away saying “the night far advanced household ers itis for you to leave when you wish the devotees of patali village assented saying “very well venerable sir’ and arising from their seats made obeisance to the bhagava not long after the departure of the devotes of patali vil lage retired in seclusion founding of the fortified city of pataliputta at that time the brahmins sunidha and vassakara chief ministers of magadha kingdom were building fortified city at the site of patali village to keep out the vijji princes during that period many devas in groups of thousand each were taking possession of plots of land at the patali village in the locations where the devas of great power had taken possession of plots of land there princes and king’s ministers of great power were inclined to build lit their minds were bent to wards building houses and where the devas of midium power had taken possession of plots of land there princes and king’s ministers of medium power were inclined to build houses and where the devas of lesser power had taken possession of plots of land there princes and king’s ministers of lesser power were inclined to build mahfaparinibbana sutta houses the bhagava saw by means of dibba cakkhu the extremely clear and divine power of vision comparable to the vision faculty of the devas and surpassing the seeing ability of men those devas who were gathered in groups of thousand each and who were taking possession of plots of land in the patali village then the bhagava arose at dawn and asked the venerable ananda “ananda who are building fortified city at the site of patali village “venerable sir the brahmins sunidha and vassakara chief ministers of magadha kingdom are building

where goods are unpacked and sold and distributed ananda three misfortunes will befall the city of pataliputta through fire through flood through internal dissension then the chief ministers of magadha the brahmins sunidha and vassakara went to the bhagava after offring courte ous greetings to the bhagava and having said memorable words of felicitation the chief ministers stood on one side and said vener able sir may it please the venerable gotama to accept our offering of food for today together with company of bhikkhus the bhagava by silence signified his acceptance then the magadha chief ministers sunidha and vassakara knowing that the bhagava had accepted their request went to their maha vagga house and having prepared at their house choice food and eatables both hard and soft kinds they informed the bhagava that it was time by the message venerable gotama it is time to proceed the food offering is ready then in the morning time the bhagava re arranged his robes and taking alms bowl and great robe went to the house of the magadha chief ministers sunidha and vassakara in the company of bhikkhus and took the seat prepared for him and the magadha chief ministers sunidha and vassakara personally attended on the bhagava and the bhiddhus offering the choice food and eatables with their own hands till the bhagava and the bhikkhus caused them to stop signifying they had had enough when the bhagava had finished his meal and had removed his hand from his alms bowl the magadha chief ministers sunidha and vassakara took low seats and sat down on one side to the magadha chief ministers sunidha and vassakara who were thus seated the bhagava signified his pleasure and apprecta tion by these verses rendered below in prose brahmens whin the wise man offers food to those endowed with moral conduct self control and purity of life at the place where he has made his home he should share the merit of the alms giving with the devas of that place when merit thus shared with them the devas being honoured honour him the sharer of merit in return being revered revere him in return therefore just as mother safeguards her own son the devas safeguard the sharer of merit and the person who is under the protection of the devas meets with only good fortune at all times after signifying his pleasure and appreciation by these verses to the magadha chief ministers sunidha and vassakara the bhagava arose from his seat and left then the magadha chief ministers sunidha and vassakara thinking “we shall call the gateway by which the ven erable gotama leaves today the gotama gateway and the landing place by which the venerable gotama crosses the river ganges the gotama landing place followed the bhagava all along the route the gateway by which the bhagava then left came to be known as the gotama gateway when the bhagava approached the river ganges the river was full to the brim so that crow on the bank mahaparinibbiana sutta might easily drink from it some people who wanted to cross from one shore to the other looked for boats others looked for log rafts still others built bam boo rafts then as instantaneously as strong man stretches his bent arm or bends his outstretched arm even so the bhagava vanished from this side of the ganges and reppeared on the other shore to gether with the company of bhikkhus the bhagava saw the people who wanted to cross from one shore to the other looking for boats for log rafts or marking bam boo rafts then the bhagava seeing them thus uttered these exult ant words “the ariya persons have crossed the deep and wide river of tanha craving by building the bridege of ariyamagga nana noble magga insight leaving behind the marshy grounds of moral defilements as for the non artya persons they have to build rafts to cross the river however the wise arlya persons who have crossed the river of craving have no more need to make rafts end of the first portion for recitation the four noble truths then the bhagava said to the venerable ananda “come ananda let us go to koti village the venerable ananda respectfully assenting the bhagava accompanied by large number of bhikkhus went to koti village and dwelt there during

be harnessed and mounting and excellent carriage left vesali for her mango grove accompanied by other excellent car riages after going in the carriage as far as carriages should prop erly go she dismounted from her carriage and approached the bhagava on foot she made obeisance to the bhagava and sat on one side and the bhagava by his discourse to ambapali sitting on one side caused her to realize the benefits of the dhamma to become established in the observance of the teaching and to be filled with gladness and enthusiasm for the practice of the teaching after the bhagava had caused her to realize the benefits of the teaching to become established in the observance of the teach ing and to be filled with gladness and enthusiasm for the practice of the teaching ambapiali the courtesan said to the bhagava “venerable sir may it please the bhagava to accept my offering of food for tomorrow together with the company of bhikkhus the bhagava by silence signified his acceptance then ambapali the courtesan knowing that the bhagava had accepted her request rose from her seat made obeisance to the bhagava and left respectfully the licchavi princes who were at vesali heard that the bhagava had reached vesali and was staying at the orchard of ambapill then the licchavi princes caused excellent and elegant carriages to be harnessed mounted them and accompanied by other elegant

with yellow mahaparinibbana sutta ornaments presenting yellow appearance some princes were dressed in red clothes with red ornaments presenting red appearance some princes were dressed in white clothes with white orna ments presenting white appearance then ambapali the courtesan let her carriage strike against the carriages of the young licchava princes axle against axle wheel against wheel yoke against yoke then the licchava princes said to ambapali the courtesan “now then ambapali why do you let your carriage strike against the carriages of the young licchava princes axle against axle wheel against wheel yoke against yoke “tt is indeed this way my princes it is becaues have invited the bhagava to meal tomorrow together with the com pany of bhikkhus ‘now then ambapali give us in exchange for hundred thousand the opportunity to offer this meal to the bhagava ‘“o my princes even if you were to give me vesali together with its subject territories could not give up the opportunity to other this meal then the licchava princes fluttering their fingers in admi ration exclaimed “oh sirs we have been defeated by woman we have been outdone by woman then the licchava princes went to the orchard of ambapalli the bhagava saw the licchava princes coming from distance and said to the bhikkhus “o bhikkhus let those bhikkhus who have never seen the tavatimsa devas have good look at the gathering of the licchavis let them take long look at the assembly of the licchavis let the bhikkhus gaze on them as if they were the tavatimsa devas then the licchava princes went in their carriages as far as carriages should properly proceed and then alighting from their carriages went on foot to where the bhagava was they made obel sance to the bhagava and seated themseves at suitable place the bhagava by his discourse to the licchava princes caused the tavatirnsa realm is the second in ascending order of the six realms of the devas the lower celestial beings the brahmas being the higher celestial beings maha vagga them to realize the benefits of the teaching to become estab lished in the observance of the teaching and to be filled with gladness and enthusiasm for the practice of the teaching after the bhagava had caused them to realize the benefits of the teaching to become established in the observance of the teaching and to be filled with gladness and enthusiasm for the practice of the teaching the licchava princes said to the bhagava “venerable sir many it please the bhagavad to accept our offering of food for tomorrow together with the company of bhikkhus then the bhagava said to them “o licchava princes have al ready accepted the offering of food for tomorrow by ambapali the courtesan then the licchava princes fluttered their fingers exclaiming “oh sirs we have been defeated by woman we have been out done by woman after that the licchava princes being delighted with and showing appreciation of the bhagava’s discourse rose from their seats made obeisance to the bhagava and departed respectfully then ambapali the courtesan after that night had passed caused choice food and eatables of both hard and soft kinds to be prepared in her orchard and then informed the bhagava that it was time for the meal by sending the message “venerable sir it is time the food offering is ready then the bhagava rearranged his robes suitably and taking alms bowl and great robe went in the forenoon to the house of ambapali the courtesan accompanied by the company of bhikkhus and on arriving there took the seat pre pared for him ambapali the courtesan personally attended on the bhikkhus headed by the bhagava offering choice hard and soft food with her own hands till the bhagava and the bhikkhus caused her to stop signifying they had had enough when the bhagava had finished his meal and had removed his hand from his alms bowl ambapi§li the courtesan took low seat and sat down on one side then she said to the bhagava “ven erable sir give this orchard in donation to the community of bhikkhus headed by the buddha the bhagava accepted the dona tion of the orchard then after causing ambapali the courtesan by his discourse to realize the benefits of the teaching to become established in mahaparinibbana sutta the observance of the teaching and to be filled with gladness and enthusiasm for the practice of the teaching the bhagava arose from his seat and departed while the bhagava was sojourning at orchard of ambapali the courtesan in vesali there too he repeatedly expounded this very discourse “such is si morality such is samadhi concentration of mind such is panna wisdom saméadhi when based upon sia is rich in result and of great effect panna when based upon samadhi is rich in result and of great effect the mind when developed through panna thoroughly liberated from the asavas moral intoxicants taints namely kamasava the taint of sensuous desire bhavasava the taint of hankering after repeated existence and avijjasava the taint of ignorance of the true nature of existence as set out in the four noble truths spending the vassa at veluva village the bhagava after staying at the orchard of ambapall the courtesan as long as he wished said to the venerble ananda “come ananda let us go to the village called veluva the venerable ananda respectfully assented saying “very well venerable sir then the bhagava went to veluva village with great many bhikkhus and while there said to the bhikkhus “come bhikkhus enter upon the residence period of the rains vassa in places where you have friends acquaintances intimates in the neighbourhood of vesali “as for me shall enter upon the residence period of the rians in this veluva village itself the bhikkhus assented respectfully saying “very well ven erable sir and entered upon the residence period of the rains in places where they had friends acquaintances intimates in the neigh bourhood of vesali the bhagava himself entered upon the resi dence period or in rains in veluva village itself’ some time after the bhagavad had entered upon the resi dence period of the rains there arose in him severe illness and he suffered excessive pain near unto death this the bhagava endured according to the commentary the buddha made this arrangement because he realized that he would pass away into parinibbana in ten months’time maha vagga with mindfulness and clear comprehension and without being per turbed then the bhagava had his thought “it would not be proper for me to pass away in the realization of nibbana without letting the attendant bhikkhus know without taking leave of the commu nity of bhikkhus therefore should ward off this illness by ef fort of insight menditation vipassana bhavana and abide in the life maintaining phala samapatti sustained absorption in fruition attainment then the bhagava warded off his illness by effort of vipassana bhavana and abided in the life maintaining phala samapatti the bhagava’s illness subsided then the bhagava having recovered from his illness came out from his monastery soon after his recovery and sat in the shade of the monastery on the seat prepared for him then the venerable ananda approached the bhagava made obeisance and having seated himself on one side siad thus to the bhagava “venerable sir see the bhagava now at ease find the bhagava now in good health though now see the bhagavad thus when the bhagava was ill my body felt heavy and stiff my sight in all directions became dim became bewildered unable to grasp doctrines such as on the methods of steadfast mindfulness how ever took some small comfort from the thought that the bhagava would not pass away into parinibbana so long as he had not left any instructions concerning the community of bhikkhus ”’ ananda what does the community of bhikkhus still ex pect from me ananda have set forth the teaching without any distinction of inner or outer doctrine the tathagatas ananda in the matter of their teaching do not hold anything secret in the closed fist of teacher do not keep back anything ananda if person should desire that he alone should lead the community of bhikkhus or that the community of bhikkhus should depend on him alone then it is that person who should lay down instructions concerning the community of bhikkhus but ananda the tathagata has no such thought or desire that just before entering into the phala samapatti the buddha made the resolution that he would live for the next ten months free of sever illness which would result in death the commentary he thereby posiponed for ten months the time of his final passing away parinibbana mahaparinibbana sutta he alone should lead the community of bhikkhus or that the com munity of bhikkhus should depend on him alone having no such thought or desire why should the tathagata leave any instructions concerning the community of bhikkhus ananda am now frail old aged far gone in years and in the last stage of life have reache the eightieth year just as ananda worn out old cart is held together merely by bindings and repairs so the body of the tathagata is held together merely by the force of the phala samapatti ananda it is only when the tathagata attains and is abiding in the animitta’ concentration of mind in the arahatta phala samapatti through not paying attention to any phenomenal image and through the cessation of some sensations mundane sensa tions that the tathagata’s body is at real ease and comfort lit at greater ease therefore ananda let yourselves be your own firm sup port and let yourselves and not anyone or anything else be your refuge let the dhamma the teaching be your firm support and let the dhamma and not anything eles be your refuge ananda how is the bhikkhus to make himself his own firm support and make himself and not anyone or anything else be his refuge how is he to make the dhamma his firm support and to make the dhamma and not anything eles his refuge ananda the bhikkhu the disciple following the practice of my teaching keeps his mind steadfastly on the body kaya with diligence comprehension and mindfulness and perceives its im permanent insecure soulless and unpleasant nature thus keeping away covetousness and distress which will appear if he is not mind ful of the five khandhas he keeps his mind steadfastly on sensa tion vedana and perceives its impermanent insecure and soulless nature he concentrates steadfastly on the mind animitta disregarding signs or attributes of phenomena phenomenal image all signs objects or ideas pertaining to the five khandhas let yourselves be viharatha lit dwell making yourselves your own firm base firm support attadipa be yourselves your island support an island in an ocean oflers firm ground for standing on the commentary maha vagga citta he keeps his mind steadfastly on the dhamma with diligence comprehension and mindfulness and perceives their im permanent insecure and soulless nature thus keeping away covet ousness and distress which will appear if he is not mindful of the five khandhas ananda thus the bhikkhu makes himself his own firm sup port and makes himself and not anyone or anything else his ref uge thus the bhikkhu makes the dhamma the teaching his firm support and makes the dhamma and not anything eles his refuge ananda those bhikkhus who either now or after my passing away make themselves their own firm support and make them selves and not anyone or anything else their refuge who make the dhamma their firm support and make the dhamma and not anything eles their refuge all such bhikkhus among all the bhikkhus who are desirous of keeping to right practice shall reach the high est noblest state end of the second portion for recitation spoken signs and intimations then the bhagava rearranging his robes in the morning time took alms bowl and great robe and went into vesali on his alms round after his alms round and after his meal leaving the place of eating the bhagavad said to the venerable ananda “ananda bring leather rug lit thing to sit on let us go to the capala shrine to spend the day there the venenrable ananda respectfully assented and taking leather rug followed closely behind the bhagava then the bhagava approached the capala shrine and seated himself on the seat placed for him the venerable ananda making obeisance to the bhagava seated himself

lit with good or bad colour he is thus aware that he knows and sees these kasina forms‘ with mastery°over them this is the first abhibhayatana jhana person concentrates on colour on parts of his own body such as colour of hair eye skin and on infinite external forms such as kasina forms umblemished or blemished he ts thus aware that he knows and sees these kasina forms with mastery over them this is the second abhibhayatana jhana person without concentrating on colour on parts of his own body concetrates on finite external forms such as kasina forms unblemished or blemished he thus aware that he knows and sees these kasina forms with mastery over them this is the third abhibhayatana jhana person without concentrating on colour on parts of his own body concetrates on infinite external forms

meditation including object of con sciousness opposite phenomena hindraces nivaranas person one who has an extremely sharp intellect among those who can quickly attain the desired jhana kasina objects of intens meditation what is perceived in the mind’s eye are the after images arising through concentration the awareness of these forms expressed by the words ‘knows and sees’ takes place before or after jhana with mastery abhibuyya lit overcoming with great facility enabling the yogi who practises this meditation to enter into jhana immediately after achieving the umblemished mental image of particular kasina object patibhaga nimitta mahaparinibbana sutta person without concentrating on colour on parts of his own body concentrates on external kasina forms that are dark blue with dark blue colour dark blue hue and dark blue lustre like the ummapuppha flower which is dark blue and has dark blue colour dark blue hue dark blue lustre or like fine cloth made in baranasi with smooth finish

abhibhayatana jhana ananda these are the eight ways of overcoming the opposite phenomena and sense objects abhibhayatana jhana eight stages of release ananda there are eight stages of release vimokkha thses are this abhibhayatan jhana is not separate jhana it is one of the riipa jhdnas the distinctive feature of the abhibhayatan shana is that it takes as its kasina objects only the four colours of dark blue yellow red and white from amongst the forty kinds of objects of meditation in abhidhamma the four primary elements namely pathavi apo tejo vayo are also considered to be objects of meditation for this abhibhdyatan jhana this abhibhayatan jhana can be achieved only by those who can quickly attain the desired jhana and even from amongst them only by those with the sharpest intellect abhibhayatan jhana is special term employed when the attainment of jhana immediately follows the achievement of the unblemished mental im age of particular kasina object patibhaga animitta of these eight ways of abhibhayatan jhana the first four exercise mastery over the finite or infinite objects of kasina meditation both internal and external the last four exercise mastery over the unblemished mental image derived from particular kasina object their object of concentration is an external kasina form and the unblemished mental image is derived also from an external kasina object see also appendix release vimokkha release through being freed of moral hindrances and defilements but not completely rooting them out freedom or release through jhana mental absorption not identical with the emancipation of an arahat as it is possible to fall from the jhana stage see also appendix mahaparinibbana sutta contemplating the kasina objects in one’s own body and hav ing attained the rlpa shana the mental absorption in form and matter one contemplates also external forms and objects such as kasina objects this is the first release not paying attention to the kasina objects in one’s own body such as colour form and corporeal features one contemplates ex ternal kasina forms this is the second release one applies oneself to the brightness and clarity subha of the object of intense contemplation’ this is the third release by concentrating on the concept ‘space is infinite’ one achieves and remains in akasanancayatana jhana where all forms of consciousness that turn on corporeality rupasaffa have been completely transcended all forms of consciousness arising out of contact between the senses and their objects patighasafifia have vanished and other forms of consciousness many and varied nanattasanna are not paid attention to this the fourth release by concentration on the concept ‘consciousness is infinite’ one achieves and remains in the vinnanafcayatana jhana having totally gone beyond the jhana of the infinity of space this the fifth release by concentrating on the concept ‘nothing is there’ one achieves and remains in the akifcafinayatana shana having totally gone beyond the jhana of the infinity of consciousness this is the sixth release one achieves and remains in the nevasannanasanna yatana et ee ae jhana the jhana of neither safif nor non safna having totally gone jhana jhana is kind of mental culture usually translated mental absorp tion in which the mind is concentrated on objects such as kasinas and in which the hindrances nivaranas are kept away from the mind le the mind is ‘distanced’ from hindrances the kasina induced jhana is mundane or worldly jhana there are four riipavacara jhanas and four ariipavacara jhanas the former can be practised to attain the sixteen fine material realms of the brahmas the object of intense contemplation in the first two stages is kasina whether it is physical object internal to the body subjectively or external objectively or an after image resulting from prolonged xa tion of consciousness on the actual kasina object maha vagga beyond the jhana of nothingness this is the seventh release one achieves and remains in sustained attainment of cessa tion nirodha samapatti in which all forms of consciousness cease having totally gone beyond the jhana of neither safna nor non safifia this is the eighth release ananda these are the eight stages of release ananda at one time soon after attained enlighten ment in the eighth week after enlightenment was staying at the foot of the goatherd’s banyan tree near the bank of the neranjara river in uruvela wood while was there the evil mara approached me and standing at certain place said to me thus

repeated existence and avijjasava the taint of igno rance of the true nature of existence as set out in the four noble truths account concerning cunda the goldsmith’s son then after staying at the town of bhoga as long as he wished the bhagava said to the venerable ananda “come ananda let us go to pava the venerable ananda respectfully assented saying “very well venerable sir ”” and the bhagava together with large com pany of bhikkhus went to pava and stayed at the mango grove of cunda the goldsmith’s son when cunda the goldsmith’s son heard that the bhagava had maha vagga arrived at pava and was staying at his mango grove he went to the bhagava and making obeisance sat at certain place to cunda thus seated the bhagavad gave discourse and by his discourse caused him to realize the benefits of the teaching to become established in the observance of the teaching and to be filled with gladness and enthusiasm for the practice of the teaching after the bhagava had caused him to realize the benefits of the teaching to become established in the observance of the teach ing and to be filled with gladness and enthusiasm for the practice of the teaching cunda the goldsmith’s son said to the bhagava “venerable sir may it please the bhagava to accept my offering of focd for tomorrow together with the company of bhikkhus the bhagava by silence signified his acceptance and cunda the goldsmith’s son knowing that the bhagava had accepted his request rose from his seat made obeisance to the bhagava and left respectfully then cunda the goldsmith’s son after that night had passed caused choice food of both hard and soft kinds as well as quantities of tender pork’ to be prepared at his house and then informed the bhagava that it was time for the meal by the message ‘venerable sir it is time to proceed the food offering ready then in the morning the bhagava got ready by rearranging his robes and taking alms bow and great robe went to the house of cunda the goldsmith’s son accompany by the company of bhikkhus and on arriving there took the seat prepared for him having thus seated himself the bhagava said to cunda the goldsmith’s son “cunda you may serve me the sikara maddava prepared by you and you may serve the other food prepared by you to the company of bhikkhus cunda the goldsmith’s son assented respectfully and accord tender pork stkara maddava siikara pig

elixir or delicate essence extracted from the roots leaves flowers etc of plant the venerable dhammapala in the udana commentary also has “young bamboo shoots liked by pigs” other interpretations based on analogical formations are “truffles mushrooms yams’ the kind of food enjoyed by wild pigs or boars mahaparinibbana sutta ingly served the prepared sikara maddava to the bhagavad and the other prepared food to the company of bhikkhus then the bhagava said to cunda the goldsmith’s son “cunda bury the remaining stkara maddava ina pit cunda apart from the tathagata himself see no one either in the celestial world of devas mara or brahmas or in the human world of samanas recluses brahmanas those leading religious life rulers and men who eating this stkara maddava can digest it well cunda the goldsmith’s son assented respectfully saying “very well venerable sir and buried the remaining siikara maddava in pit then he approached the bhagava made obeisance to him and seated himself at certain place and the bhagava by religious discourse to cunda seated on one side caused him to realize the benefits of the teaching to become established in the obser vance of the teaching and to be filled with gladness and enthusi asm for the practice of the teaching then the bhagava rose from his seat and departed later after the bhagava had eaten the food offered by cunda the goldsmith’s son severe illness came upon the bhagava severe attack of dysentery with discharge of blood and he suf fered excessive pain near unto death this the bhagava endured with mind fulness and deliberation and without being perturbed then the bhagava said to the venerable ananda “come ananda let us go to kusinara the venerable ananda assented respectfully saying “very well venerable sir separate verses have heard that after partaking of the food offered by cunda the goldsmith’s son the enlightened one suffered severe ill ness and pain near unto death after having eaten the tender pork there arose in the teacher excessive pain and illness suffering the attack of dysentery the bhagava said ’i shall go to the town of kusinara having drinking water brought then the bhagava left the road and went to the food of tree and he said to the venerable ananda “ananda fold my eee een separate verses verses separate from distinct from the text the commentary says these verses were inserted by the theras bhikkhus elders at the council maha vagga double layered robe fourfold and place it on the ground am ex hausted shall sit down the venerable ananda said “very well venerable sir and folding the bhagava’s double layered robe in four placed it on the ground the bhagava sat down on the folded robe laid on the ground and said “ananda go and bring drinking water am thirsty want to have drink of water on this being said by the bhagava the venerable ananda said to the bhagava “venerable sir five hundred carts have just now crossed the stream the shallow water being stirred up by the cartwheels flows turbid and muddy venerable sir the kakudha river is not far off there the water is clear sweet cool and free from muddiness there are good banks making the river ac cessible and it is pleasant place at the kakudha river the bhagava may drink water and also may refresh himself the bhagava said second time “ananda go and bring drink ing water am thirsty want to have drind of water for second time too ananda said to the bhagava ‘“vener able sir five hundred carts have just now crossed the stream the shallow water being stirred up by the cartwheels flows turbid and muddy venerable sir the kakudha river is not far off there the water is clear sweet cool and free from muddiness there are good banks making the river accessible and it is pleasant place at the kakudha river the bhagava may

sir assented respect fully and taking the alms bowl went to the stream then the shal low water which was flowing turbid and muddy having been stirred up by the cartwheels became clear pure and absolutely free from muddiness and this thought occurred to the venerable ananda “wonderful indeed sirs and marvellous indeed sirs is the great power and supernormal psychic potency of the tathagata this shallow stream which was flowing turbid and muddy having been stirred up by the wheels of the crossing carts is on my appear ance flowing clear pure and absolutely free from muddiness mahdapar inibbana sutta carrying the drinking water in the alms bowl the venerable ananda went back to the bhagava and said “indeed wonderful venerable sir indeed marvellous ven erable sir is the great power and supernormal psychic potency of the tathagata that shallow water of the stream which was flow ing turbid and muddy having been stirred up just now by the wheels of the crossing carts became on my approach clear pure and abso lutely free from muddiness now let the bhagava drink the water let the sugata drink the water then the bhagava drank the water account concerning pukkusa the malla prince at that time pukkusa malla prince who was desciple ofalara kalama alara of the kalama clan was on long journey from kusinara to pava seeing the bhagava sitting at the foot of tree pukkusa of the mallas approached the bhagava made obeisance to him and having sat down on one side said to the bhagava thus “wonderful it is venerable sir marvellous it wvenerble sir how the pabbajitas remain abiding in the attainment of calm “venerabl sir it happened formerly that alara kalama while on long journey left the road and sat down at the foot of tree by the roadside to spent the day venerable sir at that time five hun dred carts passed by very close to alara kalama “venerable sir certain man who had been following behind those five hundred carts went up to where alara kalama was and malla prince mal aputta lit son of the mallas the mallas were clan of the ruling khattiya class and thus princes it is possible to render ma aputta as malla youth or scion of the malla princely clan or young man of malla lineage pabbajita means one who has gone out from home one who has given up worldly life and undertaken the life of bhikkhu recluse or ascetic the term thus can indicate disciple of the buddha but here alara leading ascetic was not such disciple ascetics also engaged in deep mental culti vation attainment of calm santa instr sanfena tranquillity calmness of mind vihara instr viharena in this context state condition it is rendered in the burmese version as samapatti sustained attainment of deep mental absorp tion maha vagga asked him ‘sir did you see five hundred carts pass by ‘friend did not see them sir how is it them did you hear the noise of those carts ‘friend did not hear the noise either ‘sir how is it then were you asleep ‘friend was not asleep either ‘sir how is it then were you conscious ‘yes friend was conscious sir you say you did not see and did not hear the five hundred carts which passed close by you even though you were conscious and awake yet isn’t your double layered robe covered all over with dust from the passing of the carts ‘it is so friend “venerable sir then that man thought thus ‘wonderful it sirs marvellous it is sirs the state of calm in which the pabbayjitas remain abiding this ascetic alara although conscious and awake did not see did not hear the five hundred carts which passed close by him and expressing his feeling of deep reverence for alara kalama he departed the bhagava said pukkusa what do you think of this which is the more difficult to achieve lit do the more difficult to happen of the case of two persons the condition of one who though conscious and awake does not see and does not hear the five hundred carts which passed close by him or the condition of the other who though conscious and awake does not see and does not hear heavy rain rumbling thunder flashing lightning and carshing thunderbolts close by him venerable sir it cannot be said that remaining without see ing and hearing the carts passing close by whether it be five hun dred six hundred seven hundred eight hundred nine hundred thousand or even hundred thousand carts is difficult indeed it is much more difficult to remain without seeing and hearing heavy rain rumbling thunder flashing lightning and crashing thunder bolts close by it is more difficult to do more difficult to hap pen this sentence is as paraphrased in burmese version the pali text reads “what can lit will five hundred six hundred etc carts do that is the effect of even large numbers of carts will not be comparable to the effect of rain lightning thunder etc mahaparinibbana sutta pukkusa at one time was staying in straw hut at atuma town at that time there was heavy rain with rumbling thunder and flash of lightning and thunderbolt struck not far from my hut killing two cultivators who were brothers and four oxen then pukkusa multitude of people came out from atuma town and went up to the place where the two cultivator brothers and four oxen had been killed pukkusa by that time had come out of the straw hut and was walking up and down in the open near the door of the straw hut then pukkusa man from that crowd of people approached me and making obeisance to me stood at certain place pukkusa asked that man ‘friend why are these many people gathered “venerable sir just now two cultivators who were brothers and four oxen have been struck and killed by lightning while it was raining heavily thunder was rolling and lightning was flashing that is why this multitued of people has gathered but venerable sir where were you ‘friend have been here all the while ‘venerable sir how is it then did you see the happening ‘friend did not see it ‘venerable sir how is it then did you hear the sound ‘friend did not hear the sound either ‘venerable sir how is it then were you asleep ‘friend was not asleep either ‘venerable sir how is it then were you concsious “yes friend was concsious “venerable sir is it that though conscious and awake you neither saw nor heard heavy rain rumbling thunder flashing light ning and crashing thunderbolts ‘that is so friend pukkusa then this thought came to that man ‘wonderful it is sirs marvellous it is sirs the state of calm in which the pabbajitas remain abiding this pabbajita the buddha although con scious and awake did not see and did not hear heavy rain rumbling thunder flashing lightning and crashing thunderbolts’ and express ing his feeling of deep reverence for me and making obeisance to me departed respectfully when this had been said pukkusa the malla prince said to the bhagava maha vagga “venerable sir the deep reverence felt for alara kalama now throw away as if scattering it in great wind or as if letting it be carried away by strong current “venerable sir extremely wonderful is the truth surpass ingly beautiful is the truth venerable sir just as if that which has been turned over is turned upright or that which has been hid den is revealed or one who has lost his way is informed of the right way or an oil lamp is brought and held in the darkness so that those with eyes might see objects even so the bhagava has shown me the truth in many ways “venerable sir take refuge in the bhagava take refuge in the dhamma that teaching of the buddha take refuge in the samgha the community of bhikkhus may the bhagava accept me as lay disciple one who has taken refuge from this day to the end of life then pukkusa the malla prince called man and said to him ‘““you do go and bring the pair of fine golden hued pieces of cloth of mine kept for special occations the man replied “very well sir and went and brought pair of lengths of fine golden hued cloth then pukkusa the malla prince offered the ceremonial pieces of cloth to the bhagava say ing “venerable sir may the bhagava accept out of compassion for me this pair of fine ceremonial lengths of cloth the bhagava said “in that case present one to me and one to ananda pukkusa the malla prince said “very well venerable sir and prensented one to the bhagava and the other piece of cloth to the venerable ananda and then bhagava by religious discourse caused pukkusa the malla prince to realize the advan tages of the teaching to become established in the observace of the teaching and to be filled with gladness and enthusiasm for the practice of the teaching thus by the bhagava’s discourse having been caused to re you bhane family term used in addressing subordinates of inferiors ren dered here by “you as “friend or “my good man” would not be appropri ate in tone present this follows the rendering ‘offer or donate’ according to the com mentary the term acchadehi literally means “cover put something on somebody or something mahaparinibbana sutta alize the advantages of the teaching to become established in the observance of the teaching and to be filled with gladness and en thusiasm for the practice of the teaching pukkusa the malla prince arose from his seat made obeisance to the bhagava and departed respectfully then not long after pukkusa the malla prince had left the venerable ananda placed and arranged the pair of fine golden hued robes on the body of the bhagava when placed on the bril liantly shining body of the bhagava those golden hued robes appeared as though faded then the venerable ananda said to the bhagava “most won derful it is venerable sir marvellous it is venerable sir how ex tremely clear and fadiant the tathagata’s complexion appears when the pair of golden hued robes were placed on the bhagava’s body they became as though faded ananda it is so ananda it is so there are two occasions on which the complexion of the tathagata appears extremely clear and radiant what are these two occasions the night ananda when the tathagata attains unsurpassed supreme enlightenment and the night when the tathagata passes away realizing parinibbana by experiencing the ultimate peace of anupa disesa nibbana the complete cessation of all the five khandhas ananda these are the two occasions on which the complex ion of the tathagata appears exceedingly clear and radiant and now today ananda in the last watch of this night in the sal grove of the malla princes at the road bend leading to kusinara town the tathagata’s realization of prinibbana will take place be tween two sal trees come ananda let us go to the kakudha river the venerable ananda saying “very well venenerable sir” as sented respectfully separate verse pukkusa brought and offered to the buddha pair of fine golden hued robes enrobed in them the teacher shone in golden radiance separate verse inserted by the elder who collected the dhamma texts at the first council the commentary maha vagga then the bhagava went to the kakudha river with great company of bhikkhus and went down to the river he bathed and drank water then came onto the bank again and went to the mango grove he said to the venerable cundaka “cundaka fold my double layered robe in four and place it on the ground am weary cundaka shall lie down the venerable cundaka assented respectfully and placed the folded double layered robe on the ground then the bhagava lay down on his right side nobly like lion placing the left foot over and little beyond the right foot with mindfulness and delibera tion and keeping predetermined time of arising in his mind the venerable cundaka sat there in front of the bhagava separate verses being very weary’ the buddha the enlightened the incomparable in the world the great teacher the tathagata went to the kakudha river where the water was clear sweet and clean having come out the river after bathing and drinking water the bhagava the great teacher the highest who launched and expounded the truths of the teaching went to the mango grove surrounded by and in the midst of the entire group of bhikkhus there the buddha said to the bhikkhu called cundaka ‘fold my double layered robe fourfold and lay down shall lie down thus asked by the buddha cundaka folded the double layered robe in four and quickly placed it on the ground the great teacher feeling tired lay down cundaka also sat in front of the buddha then the bhagava said to the venerable ananda ananda someone might cause remorse or regret to cunda the goldsmith’s son by saying “friend cunda the tathagata passed away after eating your food last therefore it is loss and misfor tune to you if that happens ananda the remorse or regret cunda might fee should thus be countered “friend cunda the tathagata separate verse inserted by the elders at the first council being very weary the pali text here has akilantariipo which would mean ‘as if not weary the reading as in the udana pali text suki antaripo ‘being very weary’ would be more consistent mahaparinibbana sutta passed away after eating your food last therefore it is good for tune and good gain to you friend cunda heard and received these words from the bhagava himself there are two offerings of food which are of equal fruition and of equal result and which are of much greater fruition and much greater benefit than any other offering of food what are these two offerings of food “the offering of food after eating which the tathagata at tains unsurpassed perfect self enlightenment this is one “the offering of food after eating which the tathagata passes into the ultimate peace of anupadisesa nibbana which is the com plete cessation of all the five khandhas this is the other “these are the two offerings of food which are of equal frui tion and equal result and which are of much greater fruition and much greater benefit than any other offering of food therefore respected cunda the goldsmith’s son has accumulated that kamma force of action which will bring about long life which will bring about beautiful

occurred to the venerable ananda “if should let the mallas of kusinaéra pay homage to the bhagavad one by one night will have passed into dawn before all the malla princes finish paying reverence to

done and have nothing more to do for such realization the venerable subhadda became one of the arahats and he was the last one to become disciple in the presence of the bhagava end of the fifth

passed away the samgha the order of the bhikkhus may if it wishes to abolish lesser and minor rules of discipline ananda after have passed away let the brahma penalty be imposed upon bhikkhu channa “but venerable sir what is the brahma penalty ananda let bhikkhu channa say whatever he wishes to the bhikkhus should neither advise him nor admonish him nor deter him then the bhagava addressed the bhikkhus thus bhikkhus if any bhikkhu should happen to have any un certainty or perplexity regarding the buddha or the dhamma the teaching or the samgha the order of bhikkhus or magga or the practice then bhikkhus ask me questions do not let your selves feel regret later with the thought that ‘even though our teacher was with us in our very presence we were not able to ask him questions personally in return when this was said the bhikkhus remained silent for sec ond time the bhagava said for third time the bhagavad said bhikkhus if any bhikkhu should happen to have any un certainty or perplexity regarding the buddha or the dhamma or the samgha or magga or the practice then bhikkhus ask me questions do not let yourselves feel regret later with the thought that ‘even though our teacher was with us in our very presence we were not able to ask him questions personally in return for third time too the bhikkhus remained silent then the bhagavad said to the bhikkhus bhikkhus it may be that you do not ask questions out of respect for the teacher then bhikkhus let bhikkhu tell com panion his uncertainty or perplexity even when this was said the bhikkhus continued to remain silent maha vagga then the venerable ananda said to the bhagava “wonderful it is venerable sir marvellous it is venerable sir believe that in this community of bhikkhus not single bhikkhu has uncertainty or perplexity regarding the buddha or the dhamma or the samgha or magga or the practice ananda you say this only out of faith indeed ananda the tathagata knows for certain that in this community of bhikkhus not single bhikkhu has uncertainty or perplexity regarding the bud dha or the dhamma or the samgha or magga or the practice ananda amongst these five hundred bhikkhus even the least in attainment is sotapanna stream enterer not liable to be reborn in any apayarealm of misery assured of reaching desirable realms of existence or of reaching the end of dukkha bound for the three higher levels of insight culminating in enlightenment then the bhagava said to the bhikkhus bhikkhus say this now to you “all conditioned and com pounded things sankhara have the nature of decay and disintegra tion with mindfulness endeavour diligently to complete the task these were the last words of the tathagata the buddha’s parinibbana then the bhagava entered upon the first jhana rising from the first jhana he entered upon the second jhana rising from the second jhana he entered upon the third jhadna rising from the fourth jhana he entered upon the fourth jhana rising from the first

when jhdna is sustained it is termed samapatu the term jhana is usually used for attainment in the first four stages of deep mental absorption the four rijpa shdnas the term samapatti is used for attainment in the next stages of deep mental absorption the four aripa jhanas and also for attainment of phala and nirodha however the term samapatti is sometimes used to denote both the rapa and aripa jhanas the nirodha samapatti there is no object of meditation because of the cessation of saa consciousness mahaparinibbana sutta vinnanafnicayatana sphere of infinity of consciousness rising

absorbed in the nevasafifanacafifayatana sphere of nei ther sanna nor non safina rising from the samapatti of neither sanna nor non sanna he entered upon and became absorbed in nirodhasamapatti in which safifid and sensation conscious ness cease then the venerable ananda asked the venerable anuruddha “bhante anuruddha has the bhagava passed away the venerable anuruddha replied “avuso ananda the bhagava has not passed away he is absorbed nirodhasamapatti then the bhagava rising from the nirodhasamapatti entered upon and became absorbed in the sphere of neither saffa nor non sanna rising from

immediately after rising from the fourth jhana the bhagava passed away rearlizing parinibbdna when the bhagava passed away simultaneously with his passing away great terrible hair rising and gooseflesh caus ing earthquake occurred also rolls of thunder burst forth continu ously when the bhagava passed away at the moment of his passing away the sahampati brahma recited this verse “even such an incomparable person as the self enlightened tathagata the teacher endowed with ten strengths con sisting of his perfect comprehension in ten fields of know maha vagga edge has to pass away in this world all beings in this world must inevitably give up the aggregate of mental and physical phenomena when the bhagava passed away immediately on his pass ing away sakka king of the devas recited this verse ‘all conditioned and compounded things sankhara are in deed impermanent arising and decay are inherent in them having come into existence they cease the realization of nibbana on their cessation is blissful peace when the bhagavad passed away immediately on his pass ing away the venerable anuruddha recited this verses “the craving free sage has passed away intent on the peace of nibbana there is no more inhalation or exhalation of breath of the buddha he who had steadfast mind and equanimity “the buddha endured his physical suffering with an un shaken mind like flame extinguished the mind of that buddha has found release when the bhagavad passed away immediately on his pass ing away the venerable ananda recited these verse “when the enlightened one replete with all noble qualities passed away then at that moment there occurred the fearsome great earthquake then at that moment there occurred the hair raising gooseflesh causing great earth quake when the bhagava passed away some bhikkhus who were at that place and who were not free from the passions wept with upraised hands flung themselves down rolled forward and backward and rolled hither and thither lamenting ““too soon has the bhagava realized parinibbana too soon has the sugata realized parinibbana too soon has the eye the possessor of the eye of wisdom dissappeared from the world but those bhikkhus who were free from sensual passion could bear it mindfully and deliberately reflecting ‘all conditioned and compounded things sankhara are impermanent how then can it be possible to get that permanence in this compounded nature then the venerable anuruddha said to the bhikkhus “enough friends do not grieve do not lament had not the bhagava proclaimed from former times that there must be separation while mahaparinibbana sutta living severance through death and sundering through being in different states of existence from all that are dear and beloved friends in this matter that which has the nature of arising of ap pearing of being compounded and of decay and dissolution how can the wish that it should not disintegrate and disappear be real ized there can be no such possibility friends the devas are re proachful “but venerable anuruddha in what condition and in what state of mind are the devas “friend ananda devas who are standing in the sky taking transforming the sky as firm ground weep with dishevelled hair weep with upraised hands fling themselves down roll for ward and backward roll hither and thither lamenting ‘too soon has the bhagava realized

can bear it mindfully and deliberately reflecting all conditioned and com pounded things have the nature of impermanence how then can it be possible to get that permanence in this compounded nature then the venerable anuruddha and the venerable ananda spent the rest of the night in religious discourse then the venerable anuruddha said to the venerable ananda “go friend ananda enter kusinara and tell the malla princes of kusinara ‘o vasetthas malla princes the bhagava has passed away do now as seems fitting to you’ the venerable ananda assented saying to the venerable anuruddha ‘very well venerable sir he then in the morning rearranged his robes and taking alms bowl and great robe entered kusinara with companion at that time the malla princes were assembled at the council hall on that very business concerning the buddha’s parinibbana maha vagga then the venerable ananda went to the council hall of the kusinara malla princes and said to them “o vasetthas the bhagava has passed away do now as seems fitting to you on hearing those words of the venerable ananda the malla princes their sons daughters daughters in law and their wives felt miserably grief stricken sad at heart and oppressively sorrowfull in mind some wept with dishevelled hair with upraised hands they flung themselves down and rolled forward and backward hither and thither lamenting ‘““too soon has the bhagava realized parinibbana too soon has the sugata realized parinibbana too soon has the eye the possessor of the eye of wisdom dissappeared from the world last rites for the remains of the buddha then the kusinara malla princes gave orders to their men saying “gather flower garlands perfumes and all kinds of musical instruments in kusinara ”’ then the kusinara malla princes taking flower garlands perfumes and all kinds of musical instruments as well as five hun dred sets of clothing went to where the body of the bhagavad was in the sal grove of the malla at the road bend and there they passed the day in paying homage respect reverence and honour to the remains of the bhagava with dance song music flowers and per fumes and they made canopies of cloth and prepared pavilions of cloth then the kusinara malla princes thought “ti too late today to cremate the remains of the bhagava tomorrow we shall per form the cremation then the second day also was passed by the mallas in paying homages respect reverence and honour to the remains of the bhagava with dance song music flowers and perfumes and with the erection of canopies and pavilions of cloth in the same way the third day also was passed the fourth day also was passed the fifth day also was passed the sixth day also was passed then on the seventh day this thought occurred to the kusinara malla princes “we shall cremate the body of the bhagava south of the town carrying it to the south side beyond the town by the southern road outside the town paying homage respect reverence and honour to the remains of the bhagava with dance song music flowers and mahaparinibbana sutta perfumes and thereupon eight foremost elders amongst the malla princes after washing their heads and donning new clothes tried to lift up the body of the bhagava thinking “we shall now lift up the body of the bhagava but they were not able to do so then the kusinara malla princes saide to the venerable anuruddha ‘“‘vener able anuruddha what is the reason what is the cause that although eight of the foremost elders amongst the malla princes after wash ing their heads and donning new clothes tried to lift up the body of the bhagava thinking ‘we shall now lift up the body of the bhagava they could not do so “vasetthas it is because your intention is different from the intention of the devas ‘what venerable sir is the intention of the devas “vasetthas your intention is this we shall cremate the body of the bhagavad south of the town carrying it to the south side beyond the town by the southern road outside the town paying homage respect reverence and honour to the remains of the bhagava with dance song music flowers and perfumes the in tention of the devas however is this “paying homage respect reverence and honour to the remains of the bhagava with celestial dance song music flowers and perfumes we shall carry the re mains of the bhagavad north of the town by the northern road then entering the town by the northern gate and proceeding to the centre of the town by the central road we shall leave by the eastern gate and shall perform the cremation ceremony at the makutabandhana shrine of the malla princes on the east side of the town “venerable sir let it be according to the intention of the devas at that time all of kusinara including even fence bor ders rubbish heaps and dust bins became covered knee deep with celestial mandarava flowers then the devas and the kusinara malla princes paying homage respect reverence and honour to the re mains of the bhagava with both celestial and human dance song music flowers and perfumes carried the remains of the bhagava north of the town by the northern road then entering the town by the town by the northern gate and proceeding to the northern gate dee shrine the commentary says that this was the royal hall where the malla princes put on the ceremonial dress it was called shrine out of courtesy maha vagga and proceeding to the centre of the town by the central road they left by the eastern gate and laid down the bier with the body of the bhagava at the makutabandhana shrine of the malla princes on the east side of the town then the kusinara malla princes asked the venerable ananda “venerable ananda what should be done to the body of the tathagata “o vasetthas the body of the tathagata should be treated in the same way as is done to the remains of universal monarch “venerable ananda what is done to the remains of univer sal monarch “o vasetthas the body of universal monarach is wrapped up in new cloth after being wrapped up in new cloth the body wrapped up in carded cotton wool after being wrapped up in carded cotton wool it is again wrapped up in new cloth in this way the body of the universal monarch wrapped up in five hundred suc cessive layers of cloth and cotton wool then it is enclosed in golden oil vat and covered over by anthor golden vat then pyre of all kinds of perfumed wood is built and the body of universal monarch is cremated stupa monumental mound with dome to the honour of the universal monarch is built at the junction of four highways vasetthas this what is done to the body of universal monarch “oq vasetthas in the same way as is done to the body of universal monarch so should it be done to the body of the tathagata stupa to the honour of the tathagata should be built at the junction of four highway at that stupa people will make offerings of flowers or incense or scented powder or will pay homage or will feel reverence in their minds to such people benefit and hap piness will accrue for long time then the kusinara malla princes gave orders to their men to collect all the carded cotton wool of the malla princes then the kusinara malla princes wrapped up the body of the bhagava in new cloth after being wrapped up in new cloth the body was wrapped up in carded cotton wool after being wrapped up in carded cotton wool it was wrapped up in new cloth in this way the body of the bhagava was wrapped up in five hundred suc cessive layers of cloth and cotton wool then it was enclosed ina golden oil vat and covered over by another golden vat then pyre mahaparinibbana sutta of all kinds of perfumed wood was built and the body of the bhagava was placed on the pyre the venerable mahakassapa now at that time the venerable mahakassapa was on the way from pava to kusinara together with large company of bhikkhus numbering five hundred then the venerable mahakassapa left the road and sat down at the foot of tree at that time certain ajivaka who was naked ascetic was journeying towards pava taking with him mandarava flower from kusinara now the venerable mahakassapa saw that ajivaka coming from distance and seeing him said to that ajivaka “friend do you know our teacher yes friend know of him it is seven days now since the samana gotama passed away in fact have brought this celestial mandarava flower from there from the place where the bud dha passed way ”’ thereupon some of the bhikkhus who were not yet free from the passions from amongest the five hundred bhikkhus with the venerable mahakassapa wept with upraised hands flung them selves down rolled forward and backward and rolled hither and thither lamenting “too soon has the bhagava realized parinibbana too soon has the sugata realized parinibbana too soon has the eye the possessor of the eye of wisdom disappeared from the world but those bhikkhus who were free from sensual passion could bear it mindfully and deliberately reflecting “all conditioned and compounded things are impermanent how then can it be possible to get that permanence in this compounded nature now at that time subhadda who had become bhikkhu only in old age was amongst that assembly and that subhadda who had become bhikkhu in his old age said thus to the other bhikkhus “enough friends do not grieve do not lament we are well rid of that great samana he had oppressed us by saying “this proper for you that is not proper for you’ but now we shall do what we like we shall not do what we do not like then the venerable mahakassapa said to the bhikkhus ee this subbhadda is different person from the wandering ascetic of the same name mentioned in paras maha vagga “enough avuso do not grieve do not lament had not the bhagava expounded from long before the inevitable facts of separation while living severance through death and sundering through being in different states of existence from all that are dear and beloved avuso in this matter that which has the nature of arising of appearing of being compounded and of decay and dissoultion how can the wish that it even the body of the tathagata should not disintegrate and disappear be realized did not the bhagava ex pound from long before that there can be no such possibility now at that time four foremost malla princes after washing their heads and donning new clothes thought “we will set fire to the bhagava’s funeral pyre and tried to ignite it but were not able to do so then the kusinara malla princes asked the venerable anuruddha thus ‘venerable anuruddha what the reason what is the cause that although four foremost malla princes after washing their heads and donning new clothes tried to kindle the funeral pyre of the bhagava they were not able to set it on fire “oq vasetthas the wish lit the intention of the devas ts dif ferent “venerable sir what the wish of the devas ”’ “oq vasetthas the wish of the devas is this the venerable mahakassapa is journeying along the way from pava to kusinara with great company of bhikkhus numbering five hundred let not the bhagava’s funeral pyre catch fire until the venerable mahakassapa has paid homage with his head at the feet of the bhagava ”’ “venerable sir let be according to the wish of the devas ”’ then the venerable mahakassapa came to the funeral pyre of the bhagava at the makutabandhana shrine of the malla princes in kusinara when he had come up to it he arranged his robe over one shoulder and under the other and with the palms of his hands put together and lifted up in reverence he walked three times round the pyre with his right side to it and paid homage with his head against the feet of the bhagava the five hundred bhikkhus also who had come with the venerable mahakassapa arranged their robes over one shoulder and under the other and with their palms put together and lifted up in reverence they walked three times round the pyre with their right side to it and paid homage mahaparinibbana sutta with their heads against the feet of the bhagava when the vener able mahdkassapa and the five hundred bhikkhus had paid their homage the funeral pyre of the bhagavad spontaneously burst into flames from the outer tegument thin skin or the corium thick under skin or the flesh or the sinews or the synovic fluid of the body of the bhagava which was burnt away neither ash nor soot was to be seen only the bone relics remained just as for in stance when butter or oil is burnt away neither ash nor soot is to be seen so from the outer tegument or the corium or the flesh or the sinews or the synovic fluid of the body of the bhagava which was burnt away neither ash nor soot was to be seen only the bone relics remained of those five hundred sets of cloth wrappings only two were not consumed by fire the innermost and the outer most when the body of the bhagava had been burnt up stream of water appeared from the sky and extinguished the pyre stream of water also spurted out from those sal trees which had water in them and extiguished the pyre of the bhagava the kusinara malla princes too extinguished the pyre with water scented whth all kinds of perfumes then the kusinara malla princes surrounded the bone relics of the bhagava placed in the council hall with cordon of spearmen and bowmen and for an entire seven days paid homage respect reverence and honour to the relics with dance song music and perfumse distribution of the relics the king of magadha ajatasattu son of queen vedehi heard that the bhagava had passed away at kusinara then ajatasattu son of queen vedehi king of magadha sent an envoy to the kusinara malla princes saying “the bhagava

relics of the bhagava we too shall erect stupa over the relics of the bhagava and shall revere them the sakya princes living at kapilavatthu heard that the bhagava had passed away at kusinara then the

heard that the bhagava had passed away at kusinara then the brahmin of vetthadipa sent an envoy to the kusinara malla princes saying ‘““the bhagava was of the ruling class am of the brahmin class too deserve share of the relics of the bhagava too shall erect stupa over the relics of the bhagava and shall rever them the malla princes of pava heard that the bhagava had passed away at kusinara then the pava malla princes sent an envoy to the malla princes of kusinara saying “the bhagava was of the ruling class we too are of the ruling class we too deserve share of the relics of the bhagava we too shall erect stupa over the relics of the bhagavad and shall rever them on these words being said the kusinara malla princes said mahaparinibbana sutta thus to that assembly that group of envoys “the bhagava passed away in our domain we will not give you any share of the relics of the bhagava ”’ on this being said the brahmin dona addressed that assembly that group thus verses “o sirs listen to one word of mine our buddha was believer in forbearance it would not be at all proper if there should be strife over the sharing of the relics of him who was the noblest of men “o sirs let us all be united be harmonious be in joyful agreement and divide the relics into eight portions great many people have devotion and reverence for the possessor of the eye of wisdom let there be stupas to his honour widespread in all directions “brahmin in that case do you yourself divide fairly the relics of the bhagavad into eight equal portions saying “very well sirs to that assembly that group the brahmin dona divided fairly the relics of the bhagava into eight equal portions he then said to that assembly that group “sirs please give me this vessel used in measuring out the relics too will raise stupa over it and shall revere it accordingly the measuring vessel was given to the brahmin dona by that assem bly that group the moriya princes of pippalivana heard that the bhagava had passed away at kusinara then the moriya princes of pippalivana sent an envoy to the malla princes of kusinara saying “the bhagava was of the ruling class we too are of the ruling class we too deserve share

given all the relics of the bhagava take the charred pieces of firewood from this place of cremation and they the moriya princes took away the charred pieces of firewood from that place of cremation raising the relic stupas in reverence then king ajatasattu of magadha son of queen vedeht built at rajagaha stupa over the relics of the bhagava in reverence and honour the licchavi princes of vesali

suitable place after seating himself at suitable place the venerable ananda said this to the bhagava “venerable sir do not realise parinibbana do not pass away in this insignificant barren provincial small town venerable sir elsewhere there are great cities such as campa rajagaha savatthi saketa kosambi and baranasi let the bhagava realise parinibbana there in one of these great cities there are

explanation janavasabha sutta the venerable ananda having pondered alone and in seclusion over this matter concerning the adherents of magadha rose from his seat at the end of night towards dawn and went to the bhagava on getting to the bhagava he paid homage to the bhagava and sat in suitable place the venerable ananda after seating himself in suitable place addressed the bhagava thus “venerable

not the bhagava give the explanation and having made this indirect hinting speech to the janavasabha sutta bhagava lit in the presence of the bhagava concerning the adherents of magadha the venerable ananda rose from his seat and paying homage to the bhagava left respectfully by keeping his right side to the bhagava then the bhagava not long after the venerable ananda had left made ready by re arranging his robes in the morning and taking almsbowl and upper robe entered natika village for alms food having made his alms round in natika and having returned from the alms gathering after his meal he en tered the brick monastery after washing his feet and sat down on the seat prepared for him making as his object the understanding of fixing his mind on and concentrating all his thoughts on the matter concerning the magadha adherents saying to himself “i will find out their destination their state after death where these good people have passed on and what their condition of rebirth is and the bhagava saw the magadha adherents where these good people had passed on and what their state after death in their next rebirth was then in the evening time the bhagava rose from his solitary retirement came out of the brick monas tery and sat down on the prepared seat in the shade of the monastery then the venerable ananda approached the bhagava and paying homage to the bhagava seated himself at suitable place and said thus to the bhagava venerable sir the bhagava appears very calm and com posed because of the clear faculties the features lit the colours of the face of the bhagava are radiant and pure venerable sir think today the bhagavad has been abiding in the tranquil state of absorption in the arahatta phala ananda after making in my presence an indirect hinting speech concerning the adherents to the doctrine of magadha you arose from your seat and left soon after that made my alms round in natika village and returned from the alms gathering after my meal and entering the brick monastery after washing my feet sat down on the seat prepared for me making as my object the understanding of fixing my mind on and concentrating all my thoughts on the matter concerning the magadha adherents saying to myself “i will find out their maha vagga destination their state after death where those good people have passed on and what their condition of rebirth is and ananda saw the magadha adherents where these good people have passed on and what their state after death in their next rebirth discourse on the deva janavasabha then ananda certain deva yakkhadeva without making his appearance made his voice heard crying out “i am janavasabha bhagava am janavasabha sugata ”’ ananda do you remember having heard formerly such name as janavasabha “venerable sir do not remember having heard formerly such name as janavasabha but venerable sir hearing the name “janavasabha” makes my body hairs stand on end vener able sir this thought occurs to me that someone bearing such grand lit well designated name as janavasabha must be high ranking lit cannot be an inferior deva yakkhadeva ananda immediatedly after the voice was heard the yakkha appeared before me with splendid semblance for second time he made his voice heard crying out “i am bimbisara bhagava am bimbisara sugata venerable sir this is the seventh time have become lit been reborn as companion of the great deva king vessavana who passed away from there as king bimbisara became human king manussaraja verse from here seven and altogether up to four teen rebirths in the round of existences remember the places of existence have lived in formerly venerable sir for long there has been for me no likelihood of falling into apaya the realms of misery am vessavana one of the four great kings ruling over the lowest deva realm remember footnote in the burmese version the commentary says that due to this remembering and to over attachment to these places of existence king bimbisara became only the companion to that deva king vesavana although he would have otherwise reached the upper deva realms janavasabha sutta aware that having become sotdpanna there is for me no likelihood of falling into apaya the realms of ruin and misery but my longing to become sakadagami remains strong thus said the janavasabha deva the bhagava said wonderful are these words of yours oq venerable janavasabha yakkha marvellous are these words of yours venerable janavasabha yakkha you said ‘for long there has been no likelihood of falling into the realms of misery am aware that being sotapanna there is for me no likelihood of falling into the realms of ruin and misery but “my longing to become sakadégami remains strong from where lit from what cause or condition did the venerable janavasabha yakkha become aware of such lofty specific attainment thus said the bhagava “none other than from your teaching bhagava none other than from your teaching sugata from the time came to believe absolutely and truly in the bhagava on first seeing the bhagava for long there has been for me no likelihood of falling into the realms of ruin and misery am aware that having become sotaépanna there is for me no likelihood of falling into the realms of ruin and misery but my longing to become sakadagdmi remains strong “venerable sir was sent by the great deva king vessavana to the great deva king virulhaka on some business and on the way saw the bhagava enter the brick monastery and sit down making as his object the understanding of fixing his mind on and concentrating all his thoughts on the matter concerning the magadha adherents saying to himself ‘i will find out their course their state after death where those good people have passed on and what their condition of rebirth is and what is wonderful venerable sir is that had heard and noted that great deva king himself lit in his very presence from his very mouth had listened to that great deva king himself say to that deva assembly “those good people have gone to such destination have been reborn in such state of existence then thought to myself ‘i shall see the bhagava and shall inform him of this matter’ venerable sir for these two reasons have come to see the bhagava maha vagga assembly of devas in times past venerable sir in times long past on the full moon night of the fifteenth day at the end of the hot season being an uposatha precept observance day of the month marking the commencement of the retreat or residence period of the rainy season all tavatimisa devas were assembled together in the sudhamma hall multitude of devas were also seated all around the four great deva kings were also seated at four cardi nal points the dhatarattha deva king from the east sat facing west looking at the devas the virulhaka deva king from the south sat facing north looking at the devas the virtpakkha deva king from the west sat facing east looking at the devas and vessavana deva king from the north sat facing south looking at the devas “venerable sir thus when all the tavatimsa devas had assembled together in harmony in the sudhamma assembly hall when multitude of devas were also seated all round and when the four great deva kings had taken their seats at the four cardinal points we took our seats behind them “venerable sir those devas who arose became devas in the tavatimsa deva realm only recently after leading the life of purity brahmacariya according to the teaching of the bhagava were more splendid than the other devas in appearance lit colour and in the size of their retinue because of that venerable sir the tavatimsa devas were pleased delighted and filled with joy and satisfaction saying “indeed sirs the body host of devas has become more full and teeming whilst the full moon night the pali text has punnaya full punnamaya full moon rattiya night the word punnayana full is rendered in the burmese version by an expression meaning “‘at the full or completion time of season by this is meant the end of the previos season that is the end of the hot season the beginning of the retreat marks the beginning of the intensive rains and the end of the dry hot season the commencement of the residence period of the rainy season usually occurs in june punnaya has not been translated here janavasabha sutta the body of the asuras’ has been diminished “then venerable sir sakka king of the devas knowing the satisfaction of tavatinisd devas expressed his joyful appre ciation in these verses indeed sirs on seeing the new devas who have reached this tavatimsa realm after leading the life of purity in accordance with the teaching of the sugata the buddha and who are dos sessed of splendid appearances and large retinues the tavatimsa devas together with sakka bow down in homage to the tathagata and to the dhamma as excellent doctrine and rejoice first two verses combined above the disciples of the bhagava lit of him massively wise who have reached here this deva realm with extraordinary destination exceed other devas in splendour of appearance largeness of retinue and length of life on seeing this the tavatimsa devas with sakka bow down in homage to the tathagata and the dhamma as excellent doctrine and are pleased “venerable sir because of that expression of joyful appre ciation of sakka the tavatimisa devas were beyond measure pleased delighted and filled with joy and satisfaction saying ‘indeed sirs the body the host the mass of devas has become more full and teeming whilst the body of the asuras has been diminished “vernerable sir after the matter for which the tavatimsa devas had assembled in the sudhamma assembly hall had been considered and discussed and although the four great deva kings had received instructions and further directives on that matter they did not leave but remained in their respective places nae evn yee wa nee asura the word asura has many different definitions there are four categories of asuras but here is meant the original inhabitants of the tavatinisa devas they are called asuras because they are not as affluent as other devas maha vagga verse those four great deva kings having re ceived instructions and further directives were filled with extraordinary happiness and remained tranquil in their own places “venerable sir then at that time great effulgence of light radiance exceeding in brightness the celestial light due to the power of the devas appeared from the north then venerable sir sakka king of the devas said to the tavatimsa devas ‘sir signs are to be seen there is great effulgence of light radiance has appeared therefore brahma will cer tainly appear this occurrence of light this appearance of radi ance is portent of the appearance of brahma verse when these portents are seen brahma will appear this great extensive light is sign of the appear ance of brahma the sanankumara brahma then venerable sir the tavatimsa devas remained in their own seats thinking “we will wait to ascertain the cause of this great light only after we have seen with our own eyes the effect of this great light we will go the four great deva kings also remained in their own seats thinking “we will wait to ascertain the cause of this great light only after we have seen with our own eyes the effect of this great light we will go when they heard this announcement of brahma ap pearance by sakka the tavatimsa devas became calm and absorbed in the thought “we will wait to ascertain the cause of this great light only after we have seen with our own eyes the effect of this great light we will go “venerable sir when the sanankumara brahma appeared before the tavatinisa devas he had to appear after creating gerosser lit gross coarse form or appearence of himself venerable sir the reason is that brahmas natural or orginal appearance cannot be seen with the eyes of the tavatimsa devas venerable sir when the sanankumara brahma appeared before the tavatimisa devas he surpassed the other devas in janavasabha sutta splendour of appearance and largeness of retinue just as venerable sir golden figure outshines human form even so when the sanankumara brahma appeared before the tavatimsa devas he outshone the other devas in splendour of appearance and largeness of retinue “venerable sir when the sanankumara brahma appeared before the tavatimsa devas none of the devas in that assembly paid homage to him nor rose from his seat in welcome nor invited him to take his seat all the devas sat cross legged with the palms of the hands touching together and held up to the head as token of respect silently thinking ‘now if the sanankumara brahma desires the couch of any deva he will seat himself on the couch of that deva venerable sir if the sanankumdra brahma should seat himself on the couch of certain deva that deva would get the greatest joyful feeling would get the greatest happiness just as venerable sir an anointed king ruler over earthy domains who has been just anointed as king on the crown of the head feels the greatest joy the greatest happiness even so venerable sir the deva on whose couch the sanankumara brahma seated himself would feel lit get the greatest joy the greatest happi ness “then venerable sir the sanankumara brahma creating gross form of himself appeared before the tavatimsa devas as youth with five knots of hair on rising up into the sky he sat cross legged in aerial space just as venerable sir strong man might sit cross legged on well spread couch or on level ground even so venerable sir the sanankumara brahma rising up into the sky sat cross legged in aerial space and knowing the pleasure of the devas expressed his joyful apprecia tion in these verses indeed sirs on seeing the new devas who have reached this tavatimisa realm after leading the life of purity in accordance with the teaching of the sugata the buddha and who are possessed of splendid appearances and large retinues the tavatim si devas together with sakka bow down in homage to the tathagata and to the dhamma as excellent maha vagga doctrine and rejoice the disciples of him who is of massive wisdom the buddha who have reached here this deva realm with extraordinary distinc tion exceed other devas in splendour of appear ance largeness of retinue and longevity on seeing this the tavatimsa devas together with sakka bow down in homage to the tathagata and to the dhamma as excellent doctrine and are pleased ““venerable sir the sanankumara brahma spoke thus on this matter with voice of eightfold characteristics clear intelligible melodious pleasant to hear fully rounded uncracked deep and resonant venerable sir the sanankumara brahma voice could reach the entire audience and the sound of his voice did not go beyond the assembly venerable sir one who has voice with these eightfold characteristics said to be brahma voiced person with voice like the voice of brahma “venerable sir then the sanankumara brahma created thirty three forms of himself

tavatimsa devas cultivating of the bases of psychic power “sirs what do you the tavatinisa devas think of that which shall say to you that bhagava who is all knowing all seeing the homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened has already pointed out or declared these four bases or ways or constituents of psychic power iddhipada so as to enable psychic powers to be exercised so as to be well versed in psychic powers and so as to be able to perform miracles such as miraculous transformation assuming different forms by psy chic powers “what are these four sirs in this teaching the bhikkhu

sirs all those samanas and brahmanas also who in future times will wield many different kinds of psychic powers will do so by cultivating and repeatedly practis ing just these four bases of psychic powers and sirs all those samanas also who in present times attain many different kinds of psychic powers do so by cultivating and repeadedly practis ing just these four bases of psychic powers “sirs you tavatimsa devas you do see such psychic powers are also possessed by me do you not “we do great brahma” “sirs in my case also have attained these great psychic powers by cultivating and repeadetly practising just these four bases of psychic power “venerable sir the sananhkumara brahma spoke thus on this matter having spoken thus on this matter he addressed the tavatimsadevas’”’ attainment of three opportunities °sirs what do you the tavatimsa devas think of that which shall say the bhagava the all knowing all seeing the homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened has fully recognised the

realization of nibbana its truths are personally aperceivable because it can actually be experienced and comprehended by any one through adequate practice of insight development it not delayed in its results because it immediately yields the benefit of realization of nibbana to anyone who adequately practises insight development it can stand investigation lit to come and see because it can be

devas thus pro claimed to the tavatimsa devas these eight immutable true qualities of the bhagava venerable sir on hearing these eight maha govinda sutta immutable true qualities of the bhagava the tavatinisa devas were pleased delighted and filled with joy and satisfied beyond measure then venerable sir some of the devas at that assembly said thus “o sirs indeed it would be very good if four perfectly self enlightened ones like the present bhagava were to arise in the world and expound the dhamma that would be for the benefit and well being of great many people for safeguarding the world out of compassion for the world and for the advan tage benefit and well being of devas and men some of the devas said thus “o sirs leave alone four buddhas it would be very good if even three perfectly self enlightened ones like the present bhagavad were to arise in the world and expound the dhamma that would be for the benefit and well being of great many people for safeguarding the world out of compassion for the world and for the advantage benefit and well being of devas and men some of the devas said thus “o sirs leave alone three buddhas it would be very good if even two perfectly

is impractical and impossible that two homage worthy perfectly self enlightened ones should arise at the same time in single world system is not possible thing friends indeed it would be very good thing if that bhagava were to remain alive for very long time without illness and without suffering from disease that would be for the benefit and well being of great many people for safeguarding the world out of compas sion for the world and for the advantage benefit and well being of devas and men venerable sir after the matter for which the tavatimsa devas had assembled in the sudhamma assembly hall had been maha vagga considered and discussed and although the four deva kings had received instructions and directives on this matter they did not leave but remained in their respective places those four great deva kings having received instructions and further directives were filled with extraordinary hap piness and remained tranquil in their own places venerable sir then at that time great illuminating light with radiance exceeding the celestial light of the devas appeared from the north then venerable sir sakka king of the devas said to the tavatimisa devas “sirs signs are seen there is great illuminating light radiance has appeared therefore brahma will certainly appear this occurrence of light this appearance of radiance is portent of the appearance of brahma”’ when these portents are seen brahma will appear this great illuminating light is indeed sign of the appearance of brahma the sanankumara brahma then venerable sir the tavatimisa devas remained in their own seates thinking “we will wait to ascertain the cause of this great light only after we have seen with our own eyes the effect of this great light we will go” the four great deva kings also remained in their own seats thinking “we will wait to ascertain the cause of this great light only after we have seen with our eyes the effect of the great light we will go when they heard this announcement of brahma ap pearance by sakka the tavatinisa devas became calm and absorbed in the thought “we will wait to ascertain the cause of this great light only after we have seen with our own eyes the effect of this great light we will go” venerable sir the sanankumara brahma appeared before the tavatimsa devas only after creating grosser lit gross coarse form or appearance of himself venerable sir the reason is that brahma natural or original appearance cannot be seen by the eyes lit cannot reach the sight of the tavatim sa devas venerable sir when the sanankumara brahma ap maha govinda sutta peared before the tavatinisé devas he surpassed the other devas in splendour of appearance and number of retinue just as venerable sir golden figure outshines human form even so when the sanankumara

devas none of the devas in that assembly paid homage to him nor rose from his seat in welcome nor invited him to take his seat all the devas sat cross legged with the palms of the hands touching together and held up to the forehead as taken of respect silently thinking “now if the sanankumara brahma desires the couch of any deva he will seat himself on the couch of that deva venerable sir if the sanankumara brahma appeared be fore the tavatimsa devas he surpassed the other devas in splendour of appearance and number of retinue just as ven erable sir golden figure outshines human form even

vanished from the brahma realm and appeared before the brahmin maha vinda just as instantaneously as strong man stretching out his bent arm or bending his outstretched arm then friends as in the case of person seeing sight never seen before the brahmin maha govinda was frightened rigid with fear with body hair standing on end then friends the brahmin terrified agitated with awe and with body hair standing on end asked sanankumara brahma in verse “who are you sir who possesses such splendour of appearance such large number of retinue and are so glorious sir we ask not knowing you how may know you “in the brahma realm all the brahmas know me as sanankumara of ancient times you may call me as such govinda” “sir brahma we present to you such hospitality as seat water foot salve and sweet

benefit in the future existence then friends the brahmin maha govinda again thought “i am skilled in matters of benefit in the present even others have to ask me on matters of benefit in the present it would be well if were to ask sanankumara brahma in verse being in uncertainty ask sanankumadra brahma who has overcome uncertainty on matters which others want to know based on what and practising what course can beings attain to the immortal brahma world “brahmin govinda not regarding things in the world of men as ‘mine’ living in solitude being intent on the jhana of compassion being free from foul smell of defilements abstaining from sexual intercourse mortal based on this mortal who practises this course can attain to the immortal brahma realm” said sanankumara “your worthiness the

that causes human beings to be foul smelling that causes them to fall into the realms of misery apaya that shuts off the way to the brahma realm “govinda he who is given to these fourteen things anger speaking falsehood deceit offence against friend stinginess extreme conceit envy avarice meanness ha rassing others greed ill will vanity and bewilderment is not free from foul smell and he will go to the realms of misery and will have the brahma realm shut off from him ‘as understood ‘foul smell’ from what your wor thiness said it would not be easy for one leading worldly life to get rid of that foul smell your worthi ness shall go from the home life to the homeless life shall become an ascetic “honoured govinda it is as you wish now you know the time ”’ informing king renu then friends the brahmin maha govinda went to king renu and said ‘now your majesty please find another head priest to administer the affairs of your majesties’ kingdom wish to leave hearth and home for the homeless

any more in the home” “of what appearance is the brahma on what matter did he speak having heard what are you renouncing the home and all of us “i had previously dwelt in solitude during the rains and desiring to perform the sacrificial rites had spread about blades of kusa grass and had kindled the fire “then sanankumara brahma appeared before me and answered my question hearing that became un happy with the home life “i believe what you say honoured govinda having heard the brahma how else can you proceed than to become an ascetic “honoured govinda you are our teacher we shall follow your example just as veluriya gem is clear unstained and shining so also we will practise purely according to the instruction the admonition of govinda” “if the honoured govinda should become an ascetic leaving hearth and home for the homeless life then we too shall become ascetics leaving hearth and home for the homeless life then what is your course shall be our course informing the six rulers then friends the brahmin maha govinda approached those six rulers and said “your majesty please find now another head priest to administer the affairs of your majesties’ kingdom wish to leave hearth and home for the homeless life to become an ascetic from what heard the brahma said concerning foul smells it would not be easy for one leading worldly life to get rid of those foul smells therefore your maha vagga majesty shall become an ascetic leaving the home life for the homeless life” then friends those six rulers went aside by themselves to certain place and consulted together “these brahmins are greedy for wealth let us tempt the brahmin maha govinda with wealth” they then approached maha govinda and said “honoured sir there is in these seven kingdoms great deal of property and wealth from that take away as much as you wish “t have enough your majesties owing to your majesties’ kindness have already had great deal of property relin quishing all that property am going to be an

for the homeless life’’ “if the honoured govinda should become an ascetic going from hearth and home to the homeless life then we too shall become ascetics leaving hearth and home for the homeless life your destiny shall be our destiny” maha govinda replied if you wish to renounce these sensual pleasures to which worldlings puthujjanas are attached be firm in maha govinda sutta the strength of patience and exert steadfastly to attain the brahma realm this path of compassion jhana the straight path this path is unsurpassed this path is the good doctrine upheld by virtuous ones “in that case

brahmins and said “now sirs please find another teacher who will teach you the vedic texts wish to leave hearth and home for the homeless life to become an ascetic from what heard the brahma say concerning foul smells it would be not easy for one leading worldly life to get rid of those foul smells therefore sirs shall become an ascetic leaving hearth and home for the homeless life “honoured

shall become ascetics leaving hearth and home for the homeless life then your desire shall be our desire the brahmin maha govinda becomes an ascetic then friends after those seven days had passed the brahmin maha govinda cut off his hair shaved his beard donned the bark dyed robe and became an ascetic on his becoming an ascetic the seven anointed kings born of the ruling class the seven wealthy brahmins the seven hundred cleansed young brahmins the forty wives many thousands of nobles many thousands of brahmins many thousands of householders and many ladies including ladies of the court also cut off their hair donned the bark dyed robes and became ascetics following the example of the brahmin maha govinda then friends the brahmin maha govinda surrounded by that assembly went wandering through villages towns and capital cities friends when at that time the brahmin maha govinda got to village or town there he was universal monarch among kings as the maha brahma among brahmas as diety among householders and in those days whenever people sneezed or slipped they would cry out “homage to the brahmin maha govinda homage to the head priest of seven kings friends the brahmin maha govinda kept on diffusing thoughts of loving kindness metta in one direction in the same way he diffused thoughts of loving kindness in second direction third direction and fourth direction thus in upward downward and opposite directions putting all living beings in every direction and quarter as one with himself and covering the whole world of living beings he remained diffusing thoughts of loving kindness extensive lofty measureless peaceable free from hostility and benevolent free from malice thoughts of compassion thoughts of sympathetic joy thoughts of equanimity peaceable and benevolent he showed his disciples the path leading to companionship with the brahma in the brahma realm maha govinda sutta friends at the time the disciples who understood com pletely all aspects of the teaching of the brahmin maha govinda after their death and dissolution of the body reached the fortu nate brahma realm of the disciples who did not completely understand all the teaching after their death and dissolution of the body some were reborn as the paranimmi tavasavatti devas some as the nimmanarati devas some as the tusita devas some as the yama devas some as the tavatimsa devas and some as the catumaharajika devas and those who became the lowest kind of devas were reborn in the community of gandhabba thus friends the renunciation undertaken by all these people of good family was not in vain or barren it bore fruit and had good consequences thus said sanankumara brahma does the bhagava remember that matter paficasikha remember it “at that time was the brahmin maha govinda showed these disciples the path leading to companionship with the brahma in the brahma realm but pancasikha that life of purity which taught as maha govinda is not conducive to disgust with abandonment of attachment calmness due to ex tinction of defilements to cessation of dukkha to special apper ception and knowledge to the realization of enlightenment of the four ariya truths and to the realization of nibbana it is only to reach the brahma realm paficasikha this life of purity which now teach is condu cive to being really disgusted with the five khandhas to abandonment of attachment to cessation of dukkha to calm ness due to extinction of defilements to special apperception anhififid to enlightenment of the four ariya truths and to the realization of nibbana this life of purity taught by me now indeed is the ariya path of eight constituents namely right view right thinking right speech right action right live lihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration paficasikha this is that life of purity which is conducive to being really disgusted with the five khandhas to abandonment of attachment to cessation of dukkha to calmness due to extinction of defilements to special apperception abhifina to enlightenment of the four ariya truths and to the realization of nibbana maha vagga paficasikha the disciples who understand completely the aspects of my teaching having exhausted destroyed the asavas moral intoxicants have attained personally by them selves in this very life and through special apperception abhiniia the taint free emancipation of the mind cetovimutti and emancipation by insight panfavimutti and thus have become arahats of the disciples who do not completely understand all my teaching some as they have completely destroyed the five fetters which lead to rebirth in the lower sensuous realms have arisen spontaneously in the brahma realm and will realize parinibbana in that realm being anagamis never returners with no possibility of returning from that realm to existence in any form or any other realm of the disciples who do not completely understand all my teaching some through the complete destruc tion of the three fetters and attenuation of attachment raga hatred dosa bewilderment moha have become sakadagamis once returners who will make an end of dukkha the misery of the round of rebirths after returning to the realm of human beings only once of the disciples who do not completely understand my teaching some through the complete destruction of the three fetters have become sotapafifids stream enterers who are safe from falling into realms of misery and sufferings assured of good destination and of attaining the three higher levels of insight culminating in enlightenment thus paficasikha the renunciation undertaken by all these good people people of good family was not in vain or barren it bears fruit and has good consequences thus spoke the bhagavad paficasikha of the gandhabba family rejoicing in and appreciating the bhagava discourse paid homage to the bhagava and respectfully departed and vanished from that place end of the maha govinda sutta the sixth the long discourses of the buddha digha

bhikkhus who were all arahats most of the devas from ten lokadhatus each containing thousand cakkavalas gathered and came to pay respect to the bhagava and the community of bhikkhus then four brahmas from the suddhavasa brahma realm had this thought “this bhagavad is residing in the mahavana forest at kapilavatthu in the country of sakka to gether with large number of bhikkhus who are all arahats most of the devas from ten lokadhatus each containing thousand cakkavalas have gathered and come to see the bhagava and the community of bhikkhus it would be good if we also were to approach the bhagavad and each recite verse in the presence of the bhagava then those four brahmas just as instantaneously as strong man stretches his bent arm or bends his stretched arm vanished from the suddhavadsa brahma realm and appeared before the bhagava then those brahmas made obeisance to the bhagava and stood at suitable place then one of the brahmas recited this verse in the presence of the bhagava “in the forest of mahavana group of devas and brahmas have come together forming great assem suddhavasa brahmas are so called because they are pure clean unde filed brahmas being either anagamis or arahats there are five suddhavasa brahma realms devas in the text devata the term ‘devata’ or ‘deva’ generally as here covers both devas of the six lower deva realms and the brahmas of the

the unconquerable community of bhikkhus unconquerable by defilements kilesas then another brahma recited this verse in the presence of the bhagava “there the bhikkhus have their mind composed in concentration and keep their mind straight and up right just as charioteer holds the reins to control the horses the wise bhikkhus guard their sense faculties then another brahma recited this verse in the presence of the bhagava ‘“well tamed by the bhagava the possessor of the eye of wisdom those young arahats susunaga free from craving free from defilements suddha un stained vimala having

indasala cave in the side of the vediyaka mountain north of the brahmin village called ambasanda east of rajagaha in the country of magadha at that time there arose in sakka king of the devas strong longing to see the bhagava then sakka king of the devas wondered “where is the bhagava the homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened one residing now then seeing that the bhagava was residing at the indasdla cave in the vediyaka mountain north of the brahmin village called ambasanda east of rajagaha in the country of magadha sakka king of the devas said to the tavatimsa devas ‘‘friends this bhagava is residing at the indasala cave in the vediyaka mountain north of the brahmin village called ambasanda east of rajagaha in the country of magadha let us go and see that bhagava the homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened one” the tavatimsa devas assented saying “very well sir” then sakka king of the devas said to paficasinkha of the gandhabba devas thus “dear pancasikha the bhagava is residing at the indasala cave in the vediyaka mountain north of the brahmin village called ambasanda east of rajagaha in the country of magadha let us go and see that bhagava the homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened one” replying “very well sir” to sakka king of the devas paficasikha took his lute called beluvapandu and went to accompany sakka king of devas then sakka king of the devas surrounded by the tavatimsa devas and led by pajficasikha of the gandhabba devas vanished from the realm of tavatimsa devas just as instantaneously as strong man stretches his bent arm or bends his stretched arm and appeared on the vediyaka mountain north of the brahmin village called ambasanda east of rajagaha in the country of magadha at that time the vediyaka mountain and the brahmin village ambasanda were shining brilliantly with the radiance maha vagga due to the power of the devas and people from the surrounding villages said thus “today the vediyaka mountain is shining brilliantly today the vediyaka mountain is as if on fire today the vediyaka mountain is as if burning why are the vediyaka mountain and the brahmin village ambasanda shining bril liantly today they were frightened causing goose flesh to appear and hair to rise on their body then sakka king of the devas said to paficasikha of the gandhabba devas “dear paficasikha tathagatas are usually absorbed in jhana meditation they delight in jhana meditation at such times they are in solitary seclusion therefore it is hard for one like me to approach the tathagata dear paficasikha it would be well if you were first to ask the bhagava for permission for me to see the bhagava and then after you have asked for permission we will go and see the bhagava the homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened one” replying ‘very well sir’ to sakka king of the devas paficasikha of the gandhabba devas took his beluvapandu lute and went to the indasala cave when he got there he stood at suitable place thinking ‘here shall not be too far from or too near the bhagavad and the bhagava can hear the sound of my lute verses sung by paficasikha standing at suitable place pancasikha of the gandhabba devas played on the lute named beluvapandu he also sang these verses concerning the buddha the dhamma the samgha the arahats and sensual pleasures “my dear suriyavaccasa you are possessor of exquisite beauty you have captivated my heart bow deeply to your father timbart who has caused you to be born radiant one just as person who is oppressed with heat longs for cool breeze just as person who is oppressed with thirst longs for cool water just as an arahat longs for magga phala and nibbana so also am filled with longing for you my dear one just as medicine cures the disease of sakka pajiha sutta patient food relieves the hunger of starving person just as water extinguishes burning fire so also let your love soothe my loving heart my dear just as mighty elephant oppressed with heat plunges into the lake that is full of cool water and fragrant lotus so also do wish to rest in your bosom my dear just as an elephant overwhelmed by sexual urge loses his reason and becomes uncontrollable so also do overwhelmed with love for you and your pair of exquisite thighs lose my reason my dear my mind is disturbed and is deeply attached to you like fish that has swallowed the hook cannot free myself from my love for you my dear who has pair of exquisite thighs please put your arms around me my dear who is in the habit of glancing with enticing eyes put your arms around me my dear the possessor of five kinds of exquisite beauty please em brace me am yearning for this warm embrace of yours my dear in the beginning my love for you was not much but just as the merit earned as result of making an offering to an arahat increases boundlessly so also my love for you like hair with curling tips grew boundlessly my dear the possessor of all kinds of beauty may all the good deeds of making offerings to the arahats who are unperturbed by the vicisstitudes of life who are full of forbearance bring about our union my dear the possessor of all five kinds of beauty may all the mierit which have earned on earth bring about our union my dear siriyavacchasa just as the bhagava’ of the sakyan clan searched for the deathless nibbana with one pointedness of concentration in jhana with wisdom and mindfulness so also have searched for you my dear the possessor of exquisite beauty just as the muni rejoiced in having attained the noble enlighten just as the bhagava in the text muni maha vagga ment so also may rejoice in being together with you my dear siriyavacchasa if sakka king of the tavatimisa devas should grant me any wish the only wish will make will certainly be to have you my love for you is so steadfast wise one deeply bow to your father who is like freshly blooming sal tree for having such an excellent daughter” when thus sung the bhagavad said to paficasikha of the gandhabba devas thus “paficasikha the sound of the lute is in harmony with the sound of the singing and the singing in harmony with the sound of the lute the sound of your lute does not overwhelm the sound of the singing and the sound of the singing too does not overwhelm the sound of the lute paficasikha when did you compose these verses pertaining to the buddha the dhamma the samgha the arahats and the sensual pleasures “venerable sir at one time the bhagava was staying under the ajapala banyan tree on the bank of the neranjara river in the uruvela wood just after attaining the enlightenment venerable sir at that time was in love with suriyavacchasa also called bhadda the daughter of timbaru king of gandhabba devas but venerable sir that girl loved another she was in love with sikhandi son of charioteer matali ”’ “venerable sir when could not get that girl by any means took my lute beluvapandu and went to the residence of timbaria king of the gandhabba devas having got there played the lute and sang these verses pertaining to the buddha the dhamma the samgha the arahats and sensual pleasures’ “my dear suriyavacchasa you are possessor of exquisite beauty you have captivated my heart bow deeply to your father timbart who has caused you to be born wise one deeply bow to your father timbari who is like freshly blooming sal tree for having such an excellent daughter’ “venerable sir when this was sung bhadda siriyavacchasa sakka pajiha sutta said to me thus ‘sir have not personally seen that bhagava but have heard about that bhagava when was dancing at the sudhamma assembly hall of the tavatimisa devas sir because you have praised that bhagava let there be an intimate meeting between us today’ venerable sir that was the only time had an intimate meeting with that girl from that time up to now there has been no such meeting” the approach of sakka then sakka king of the devas thought paficasikha of the gandhabba devas has exchanged glad greetings with the exalted one then sakka king of the devas said to paficasikha of the gandhabba devas “dear paficasikha go to the bhagava and respectfully say ‘venerable sir sakka king of the devas with his ministers and attending retinue pays homage at the feet of the bhagava’ replying “very well sir to sakka king of the devas pajicasikha of the gandhabba devas respectfully said to the bhagava “venerable sir sakka king of devas with his min isters and attendant retinue pays homage at the feet of the bhagava” the buddha replied ‘very well paficasikha may happiness be to sakka king of the devas and his ministers and his attendant retinue happiness is indeed desired by devas humans asuras nagas gandhabbas and hosts of other beings” the tathagatas usually greet such powerful yakkhas devas in this way after the bhagava’s greeting sakka king of the devas entered the indasdla cave paid homage to the bhagava and stood at suitable place the tavatimsa devas too entered the indasdla cave paid homage to the bhagava and stood at suitable place paficasikha of the gandhabba devas also entered the indasala cave paid homage to the bhagava and stood at suitable place at that time although the indasala cave was originally uneven it became even and smooth although it was originally narrow it became spacious the darkness in the cave vanished and light appeared due to the celestial power of the devas maha vagga then the bhagava said to sakka king of the devas thus “wonderful and marvellous it is that you venerable kosiya having so many affairs to attend to and so many things to do should come here” “venerable sir from long before have desired to come and see the bhagavad but having been intent on some business or other among the tavatimsa devas had not been able to come and see the bhagavad venerable sir at one time the bhagava was residing in the salala chamber at savatthi at that time venerable sir went to savatthi to see the bhagava but at that very time the bhagava was absorbed in certain jhana handmaiden of the deva king vessavana called bhiyjati was present in attendance standing in homage with upraised palms together then venerable sir said to bhuyjati “deva maiden respectfully say to the bhagava that sakka king of the devas with his ministers and attending retinue pays homage at the feet of the bhagava’’ venerable sir on this being said by me bhujati said to me “sir it is not the proper time to see the bhagava the bhagava is in solitary seclusion” “in that case deva maiden when the bhagavad rises from that jhanic absorption respectfully say in homage to the bhagava that sakka king of the devas with his ministers and attending retinue makes obeisance at the feet of the bhagava” “vener able sir did that deva maiden convey my words of homage to the bhagava does the bhagava remember the words of that deva maiden “king of the devas that deva maiden did convey your words to me do remember the words of that deva maiden actually had risen from that jhana at the sound of the venerable’s chariot wheels”’ ‘venerable sir had heard and understood from these devas themselves who had reached the tavatimsa realm before us that when the homage worthy the perfectly self enlight ened tathagatas arise in the world the number of devas in kosiya an epithet of sakka since sakka was of kosiya lineage absorbed in certain jhana this is what sakka thought actually the bhagava was absorbed in the attaimment of fruition sakka pafiha sutta creases and the number of asuras diminishes and venerable sir in this matter myself have seen this from the time the tathagata the homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened one arose in the world the number of devas have increased and the number of asuras have diminished’ the story of deva gopaka “venerable sir there was in this very country of kapilavatthu daughter of the sakyans named gopaka who revered the buddha the dhamma and the samgha and who observed fully the moral precepts that princess loathing the nature of womanhood performed actions that would lead to rebirth as man and on the death and dissolution of her body reached the happy realm of the tavatimsa devas as son of ours there too that deva was addressed as gopaka devaputta’’ venerable sir three others who were bhikkhus in spite of practising the noble life of purity under the bhagava were reborn in the community of the gandhabbas the inferior devas fully and thoroughly enjoying the five kinds of sensual plea sures they came to the assembly of the devas to entertain us to those three gandhabba devas who came to entertain us gopaka devaputta reproved thus “sir where was your attention fixed and turned when you were listening to the bhagava’s teaching even though was woman who revered the buddha the dhamma and the samgha and who observed the moral precepts loathed being woman and performed actions leading to rebirth as man on the death and dissolution of my body have reached the happy realm of the tavatinisa devas as son of sakka king of the devas here too am being addressed as of gopaka devaputta” “sirs as for you in spite of practising the noble life of purity under the bhagava you have been reborn in the commu nity of gandhabba devas the inferior devas sirs it is sorry sight for me to see companions in the noble practice in the community of the gandhabbas the inferior devas “venerable sir of those three gandhabba devas who were reproved by gopaka devaputta two regained mindfulness of the first jhina in that very life and reached the brahma maha vagga realm but one of them remained indulging in the enjoyment of the sensual pleasures “i was female disciple of the possessor of the eye of wisdom the buddha my name was gopaka revered deeply the buddha the dhamma and the samgha with reverential mind “only because of the excellence of the dhamma of that buddha have been reborn in the tavatimsa deva realm possessing great power and great splendour as son of sakka here too am known as gopaka “then saw the former bhikkhus whom had seen previously arisen and dwelling in the community of the gandhabbas indeed formerly when we were humans we had at our homes ministered to those gandhabbas who were then gotama’s disciples with food and drink with cleansing water for the feet and foot salve where was their attention fixed on when the venerables were listening to the buddha’s teaching “the dhamma penetratingly known and well expounded by the possessor of the eye of wisdom can be realized individually indeed it was by closely attending and listening to what the ariyas propounded well that have reached the tavatimsa deva realm possessing great power and great splendour as the son of sakka but sirs as for you in spite of having closely attended on the buddha and in spite of having practised the noble life of purity which is incomparable you have been reborn in the community of gandhabbas the inferior devas “the existence you have reached sirs not fitting it indeed an unpleasant sight to see companions in the noble practice being reborn in the inferior community sirs having arisen in the community of gandhabbas you have to come and entertain us lived the life of householder and yet look at this extraordinary state who was woman in the previous existence have now become male deva fully endowed with the sensual pleasures of the devas” in the text settha the supreme one sakka pafiha sutta those three who were thus reproved by gopaka the disciple of gotama felt remorseful on account of what gopaka had said and said “now let us make an effort let us exert ourselves strenuously let us not be servants of others of those three two exerted strenuously repeatedly reflecting on the teaching of the buddha in this very deva realm itself having freed their minds of attachment they saw the faults of sensual pleasures as strong elephant might break the binding ropes those two devas cutting the bonds and fetters of sensual pleasures which are mara’s yokes so difficult to overcome surpassed the tavatim sa devas by reaching the brahma realm getting rid of attach ment the two mighty devas became anaigamis surpassing all the devas attending the suddhamma deva assembly including sakka and pajapati and reached the brahma realm seeing them vasava sakka king of the devas felt emotional awareness in the midst of the devas saying “those two devas although they had been reborn in the inferior community of the gandhabbas have surpassed the tavatimsa devas and have reached the brahma realm then hearing the words of vasava sakka who was filled with emotional aware ness the deva gopaka said to him “sir there is the buddha lord of all living beings in the human world he is renowned as sakyamuni conqueror over sensual pleasures those devas those gandhabbas were sons of the buddha himself they had forsaken the mindfulness of the first jhadna only being reproved by me they regained the mindfulness of the first jhana of those three one still continues to remain in the community of the gandhabbas two of them however attained the anadgdmi magga and being established firmly in concentration they regard even the devas as inferior’ “there are in this teaching such noble disciples who make evident the truth of the dhamma how can anyone among them have any doubt in the buddha the dhamma and the samgha let us then make obeisance to the buddha who has crossed the whirlpool ogha who has cut off doubt and uncertainty who is the conqueror’ and the lord of all beings” conqueror jina conqueror over five hostile forces or five maras maha vagga “venerable sir of those three two were reborn in the brahmapurohita realm having come to understand your dhamma in this deva realm and having attained anagami magga “venerable sir we have come here to attain this dhamma venerable sir if the bhagava will grant permission we wish to ask question’ thus said sakka then the bhagava thought this yakkha sakka has led for long time pure life whatever question he may ask will be to good purpose it will not be useless and what shall answer to his question that he will quickly understand then the bhagava said in verse to sakka king of the devas “vasara ask me whatever question you have in mind shall answer your question to the end to your satisfac tion end of the first portion for recitation on being given permission by the bhagava sakka king of the devas asked the bhagava this first question “venerable sir devas humans asuras nagas gandhabbas and other groups of beings have this wish “may we live without hatred without violence without enmity without malevolence and without hostility and yet they live in hatred in violence in enmity in distress and in hostility to what fetters is this due in this manner sakka king of the devas asked the bhagava this question the bhagava answered the question of sakka thus “king of the devas devas humans asuras nagas gandhabbas and other groups of beings though wishing to live without hatred without violence without enmity without distress and without hostility yet live in hatred in violence in enmity in distress and in hostility due to the fetters of envy issa and namely devaputta mara kilesa mara khandha mara macca mara and abhisankhara mara issas jeasously envy ill will sakka pafiha sutta stinginess macchariya ”’ this was the way the bhagavad answered the question of sakka king of the devas delighted with what the bhagava said sakka king of the devas received it with gladness “so it is bhagava so it is sugata hearing the bhagava’s answer to the question have overcome doubt am rid of uncertainty in this matter’ having thus expressed delight in what the bhagava had said and having received it with gladness sakka king of the devas asked the bhagava further question “venerable sir what the cause of envy and stinginess what is their origin what is their genesis what is their source what being present do envy and stinginess come about what being not present do envy and stinginess not come about “king of the devas likes and dislikes piya appiya are the cause of envy and stinginess likes and dislikes are their origin likes and dislikes are their genesis likes and dislikes are their source likes and dislikes being present envy and stingi ness come about likes and dislikes not being present envy and stinginess do not come about” “venerable sir what is the cause of likes and dislikes what is their origin what is their genesis what is their source what being present do likes and dislikes come about what being not present do likes and dislikes not come about king of the devas desire chanda is the cause of likes and dislikes desire is their origin desire gives birth to them desire is their source desire being present likes and dislikes come about desire being not present likes and dislikes do not come about “but venerable sir what is the cause of desire what is its origin what is its genesis what is its source what being present does desire come about what being not present does macchariya avarice stinginess selfishness meanness chanda here it is equivalent to tanha craving maha vagga desire not come about “king of the devas initial application of the mind vitakka is the cause of desire intial application of the mind ts its origin initial application of the mind is its genesis initial application of the mind is its source initial

following my teaching keeps his mind steadfastly on the body kaya with diligence comprehension and mindfulness and perceives its impermanent insecure soulless and repulsive nature thus keeping away covetousness and distress which will appear if he is not mindful of the five khandhas the bhikkhu keep his mind steadfastly on sensation vedana with diligence comprehension and mindfulness and perceives its impermanent insecure and soulless nature thus keeping away convetousness and distress which will appear if he is not mindful of the five khandhas the bhikkhu concentrates steadfastly on the mind citta with diligence comprehension and mindfulness and perceives its im permanent insecure and soulless nature thus keeping away convetousness and distress which will appear if he is not

section on breathing bhikkhus how does the bhikkhu keep his mind stead fastly on the body bhikkhus the bhikkhu following the practice of my teach ing having gone to the forest or to the foot of tree or to an empty solitary place sits down cross legged keeping his body erect and sets up mindfulness orienting it towards the object of concen tration then with entire mindfulness he breathes in and with entire mindfulness he breathes out breathing in long inhalation he is conscious of breathing long inhalation or breathing out long exhalation he conscious of breathing out long exhalation breathing in short inhalation he is conscious of breathing in short inhalation or breathing out short exhalation he conscious of breathing in short exhalation he trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the in coming breath at its begining its middle and at its end he trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the out going breath at its begining its middle and at its end by being fully conscious of the inhalation he trains himself to calm down the strong inhalation as he breathes in by being fully conscious of the exhalation he trains himself to calm down the strong exhalation as he breathes out just as bhikkhus skilful turner or turner’s appearentice knows long pull on the string turning the lathe when long pull is made or knows short pull when short pull is made even so dhamma the five dhammas consisting of five nivaranas five khandhas twelve ayatanas seven bojjhangas and four ariya saccas this will become clear in paras to of this sutta no special effort necessary to calm down the strong inhalation and exhalation the more one gets mental concentration the more the strong inhalation and exhalation will calm down when the mental concentration reaches its highest point inhalation and exhalation will become so delicate that the yogi will feel that his breathing has stopped mahasatipatthana sutta bhikkhus the bhikkhu breathing in long inhalation is conscious of breathing in long inhalation or breathing out long exhalation or breathing in short inhalation is conscious of breathing in short inhalation or breathing out short exhalation he trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the in coming breath at its beginnig its middle and at its end he trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the out going breath at its beginnig its middle and at its end he trains himself to calm down the strong inhalation as he breaths in he trains himself to calm down the strong exhalation as he breaths out thus he keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physi cal phenomena which is his own breathing and perceives its impermanent insecure and soulles nature occasionally he real izes that the aggregate of physical phenomena which is the breath ing of others must be of similar nature because of this realiza tion he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which ts the breathing of others in this way he is considered to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which ts his own breathing or which is that of others when he gains more concentration he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of the aggregate of physical phe nomena which is the process breathing he also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the aggregate of physical phe nomena which is the process of breathing he also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of the aggre gate of physical phenomena which is the process of breathing with their causes and further the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there is only the aggregate of physical phenomena which is inhaling and exhaling that mindfulness is solely for gainig vipassana insights progressively solely for gaining further mindfulness stage by stage the bhikkhu remains detached from craving and wrong views without clinging to any of the five khandhas that are continuously deteriorating bhikkhus it is in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body perceiving its true nature end of the section on breathing ne ee oe the causes of the appearing and dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena which is inhalation and exhalation are the existence or the non existence of the body the nose and the mind maha vagga perception of the true nature of the body ii section on body movement and posture and again bhikkhus the bhikku when walking is con scious of walking or when standing he is conscious of standing or when sitting he is conscious of sitting or when lying down he is conscious of lying down or in whatever movement or posture his body is he is conscious of it thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physi cal phenomena which is his body and perceives its impermanent insecure and soulles and repulsive nature occasionally he re alizes that the aggregate of physical phenomena which is the body of others must be of similar nature because of this realization he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physi cal phenomena which is the body of others in this way he is con sidered to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his own body or which that of others when he gains more concentration he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of the aggregate of physical phenomena which the body he also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the ageregate of physical phenomena which the body he also per ceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena which is the body with their causes’ and further the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there is only the aggregate of physical phenomena without soul the causes of appearing of physical phenomena are ignorance of the four ariya truths craving kamma and nutriment they and their effect the continuous appearance of physical phenomena are called five samudaya dhamma the perception of these five samudaya dhamma called samudaya dhammanupassi they are perceived in the following way when the bhikkhu can steadfastly keep his mind on the body postures by means of diligence mindfulness concentration comprehension he perceives the sign or incessant appearance of physical phenomena nibbatti lakkhana this perception usually begins when the bhikkhu achieves the second vipassana fana paccaya pariggaha hana from this perception the bhikkhu draws the conclusion that rebirths of beings take place in similar way therefore whill the bhikkhu is perceiving the continuous appearance of physical phenomena he realizes that endless rebirths are due to ignorance of four ariya truths craving for pleasure of th senses kamma decds words and thoughts which has the potency for rebirth as its mahasatipatthana sutta and or atta directing it that mindfulness is solely for gainig vipassana insights progressively solely for gaining further mind fulness stage by stage the bhikkhu remains detached from craving and wrong views without clinging to any of the five khandhas that are continuously deteriorating bhikkhus it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body perceiving its true nature end of the section on body movement and posture perception of the true nature of the body section on clear comprehension and again bhikkhus the bhikkhu in moving forward and in moving back does so with clear comprehension in looking straight ahead and sideways he does so with clear comprehension in bending and in stretching his limbs he does so with clear com effect nutriment which ts essential for physical phenomena mind citta which is the motivating force heat and cold the cause of dissolution of physical phenomena are the absence of the above factors the bhikkhu then realizes that extinction of ignorance of four ariya truths will cause the extinction of endless appearance of physical phenomena the actual perception of the sign of change or disappearance or deterioration of physical phenomena will begin when the bhikkhu achieves the third vipassana fidna sammasanafiana the sign of change is called viparindma lakkhana in fact the perception of th appearance and disappearance of physical phenomena by means of nibbatti and viprinama lakkhana becomes clearer when the bhikkhu achieves the fourth vipassana nana udayabbaya fiana however the perception of only the disappearance of physical phenomena becomes stronger when he achieves the fifth vipassana fhana bhanga nana this shows the mental state of the bhikkhu when his mindfulness is at its height before he reaches this mental state he occasionally imagines in spite of his efforts to be mindful that body and limbs are his that his jiva soul or atta is directing them to make postures occasionally he even feels proud of and pleased with “his” body and limbs these false views of the body and limbs begin to disappear when he achieves the fifth vipassana fiana bhanga fiana from that stage the bhikkhu perceives only the deterioration of the body and he is not longer conscious of the body and the limbs as such and therefore he does not take pride and pleasure in them with this perception of the non existence of the body and limbs he fully achieves the eleventh vipassana nana sankharupekkhafina —a maha vagga prehension in craving or wearing the great robe alms bowl and the other two robes he does so with clear comprehension in eating drinking chewing and savouring he does so with clear comprehen sion in defecating and urinating he does so with clear comprehen sion in walking standing sitting falling asleep waking apeaking or in keeping silent he does so with clear comprehension thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physi cal phenomena which is his body that are continuously deterioating bhikkhus it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body perceiving its true nature end of the section on clear comprehension perception of the true nature of the body iv section on consideration of repulsiveness and again bhikkhus the bhkkhu examines and reflects closely upon this very body from the soles of the feet up and from the tips of the hair down enclosed by the skin and full of manifold impurities thinking thus “there are in this body hair of the head hairs of the body nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones marrow kidneys heart liver membranes including the pleura the diaphragm and other forms of meberance in the body spleen lungs large intestine small intestine contents of the stomach faeces brain bile phlegm pus blood sweat solid fat tears liquid fat saliva nasal mucus synovic fluid lubricating oil of the joints and urine just as if bhikkhus there were bag with an opening at each end and full of various kinds of grain such as hill paddy paddy green gram cow pea sesame and husked rice and man with sound eyes having opened it should examine and reflect on the con tents thus “this hill paddy this paddy this is green gram this cow pea this is sesame and this is husked rice ”’ even so bhkkhus the bhikkhu examines and reflects on this very body from the soles of the feet up and from tips of the hair down enclosed by the skin and full of manifold impurities thinking thus “there are in this body hair of the head urine thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physi cal phenomena which is his body that are continuously ‘the brain’ is not included in the pali text of this sutta but is included in the patisambihda magga mahasatipatthana sutta deteriorating bhikkhus it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body perceiving its true nature end of the section on consideration of repulsiveness perception of the nature of the body section on consideration of the primary elements and again bhikkhus the bhikkhu examines and reflects on this body in whatever position it remains or is placed as com posed of the primary elements’ “there are in this body only the earth element the water element the fire element and the air ele ment just as if bhikkhus skilful butcher of butcher’s appren tice having slaughtered cow and cut it up into portions should be sitting at the junction of four

bhikkhus is called right action and bhikkhus what is right livelihood bhikkhus the ariya disciple following my teaching completely abstains from wrong way of livelihood and makes his living by right means of liveli hood this bhikkhus is called right livelihood and bhikkhus what is right effort bhikkhus the bhikkhu following my teaching generates will makes effort rouses en ergy applies his mind and strives most ardently to prevent the arising of evil demeritorious states of mind that have not yet arisen he generates will makes effort rouses energy applies his mind and strives most ardently to abandon evil demeritorious states of mind that have arisen he generates will makes effort rouses en ergy applies his mind and strives most ardently to attain meritori ous states of mind that have not yet arisen he generates will makes effort rouses energy applies his mind and strives most ardently to maintain the meritorious states of mind that have arisen to prevent maha vagga their lapsing to increase them to cause them to grow to make them develop in full in samatha vipassana meditation this bhikkhus is called right effort and bhikkhus what is right mindfulness bhikkhus the bhikkhu the disciple following my teaching keeps his mind steadfastly on the body kaya with diligence comprehension and mindfu ness and perceives its impermanent insecure soulless and repulsive nature thus keeping away covetousness and distress which will appear if he is not mindful of the five khandhdas the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on sensation vedana with diligence comprehension and mindfulness and perceives its impermanent insecure and soulless nature thus keeping away cov etousness and distress which will appear if he is not mindful of the five khandhdas the bhikkhu concentrates steadfastly on the mind cifta with diligence comprehension and mindfulness and perceives its im permanent insecure and soulless nature thus keeping away covet ousness and distress which will appear he is not mindful of the five khandhdas the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the dhamma with diligence comprehension and mindfulness and perceives their permanent insecure and soulless nature thus keeping away covet ousness and distress which will appear if he is not mindful of the five khandhdas this bhikkhus is called right mindfulness and bhikkhus what is right concentration bhikkhus the bhikkhu who follows my teaching being detached from sensual pleasures and demeritorious factors achieves and remains in the first jhana which has vitakka initial application of the mind vicara sustained application of the mind pit delightful satisfaction and sukha bliss born of detachment from the hindrances nivaranas having got rid of vitakka and vicara the bhikkhu

having been detached from piti that bhikkhu dwells in equa nimity with mindfulness and clear comprehension and expressions sukha in mind and body he achieves and remains in the third jhana that which causes person vho attains it to be praised by the noble mahasatipatthana sutta ones as one who has equanimity and mindfulness one who abides in sukha by dispelling both pain and pleasure and by the previous disappearance of sadness and gladness that bhikkhu achieves and remains in the fourth jhana state of equanimity and absolute pu rity of mindfulness without pain or pleasure this bhikkhus is called right concentration bhikkhus this is called the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of dukkha thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the dhamma in himself and perceives that they are just phenomena without any entity or soul occasionally he realizes that the dhamma in others must be of similar nature because of this realization he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on the dhamma in others in this way he is considered to keep his mind steadfastly on the dhamma in himself or in others when he gains more concentration he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of the dhmma he also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the dhamma he also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual disso lution of the dhamma with their causes and further the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there are only the dhamma that mindfulness is solely for gaining vipassana insights progressively solely for gaining further mindfulness stage by stage the bhikkhu remains detached from craving and wrong views without clinging to any of the five khandhas that are continuously deteriorating bhikkhus it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the four noble truths perceiving their true na ture end of the section on the noble trurhs end of “perception of the true nature of dhamma” indeed bhikkhus whosoever practises these four meth ods of steadfast mindfulness in this manner for seven years one of two results is to be certainly expected in him arahatship ana the knowledge of final emancipation arahatta phala in this

four months for three months for two months for one months for half month let alone half month bhikkhus whosoever practises these four methods of steadfast mindfulness in this manner for seven days one of two results is to be certainly expected in him arahatship in this very existence or if there yet be any trace of clinging left the state of an anagami because of these beneficial results have declared at the begining thus “bhikkhus this the one and only way for the purification of the minds of beings for overcoming sorrow and lamentation for the complete destruction of physical pain and mental distress for attainment of the noble ariya magga and for the realization of nibbana that only way is the practice of the four methods of steadfast mindfulness satipatthana ”’ thus spoke the

simsapa trees north of setavya at that time governor’ paydsi ruled over setavya which was densely populated teeming with livestock abundant in fodder firewood water and grain the town was granted him permanently by king pasenadi of kosala as royal gift the story of governor payasi at that time there arose in governor paydsi’s mind an evil view “for this reason there is no other world there is no rebirth of beings after death there no fruit phala or result vipaka of good or bad deeds the brahmins and householders of setavya heard thus “indeed friends the samana kumara kassapa disciple of the samana gotama while journeying through the country of the kosalans with large number of bhikkhus numbering five hundred has reached setavya and is staying in grove of sim sapa trees north of setavya now the excellent reputation of that venerable kumara kassapa has spread thus ‘he is wise experienced of great intelligence of wide knowledge bril liant orator capable of good replies elderly and is

prerogatives and taxes from ruling over town or limited domain translated here as ‘governor’ maha vagga out in groups became huge crowd and went northward to the simsapa grove at that time governor payasi had gone up to the upper terrace of his palace for rest during the day governor payasi saw the brahmins and householders of setavya coming out in groups becoming huge crowd and going northward to the simisapa grove seeing them he asked his minister “o minister why are the brahmins and householders of setavya coming out in groups forming crowd and going northward to the simsapa grove “sir the samana kum§arakassapa disciple of the samana gotama while journeying through the kosalan country with large number of bhikkhus numbering five hundred has reached setavya and is staying in the

there is no other world there is no rebirth of beings after death there is no fruit or result of good or bad deeds” replying “very well sir the minister went to the brahmins and householders of setavya and said to them “friends governor payasi has asked you to wait governor payasi also will go to see samana kumarakassapa” then governor paydsi surrounded by retinue of payasi sutta brahmins and householders of setavya went to the venerable kumarakassapa at the simsapa grove and exchanged glad greetings after having concluded amiable and courteous ereet ings he sat at suitable place some of the brahmins and householders of setavya paid homage to the venerable kumarakassapa and sat at suitable places some exchanged glad greetings with the venerable kumarakassapa and having concluded

some announced their names and family and seated themselves at suitable places some silently sat at suitable places the natthika vada the belief that there is no fruit or result of good or bad actions seated at suitable place governor payasi said to the venerable kumarakassapa thus “kassapa sir say this and believe this ‘for this reason there is no other world there is no rebirth of beings after death there is no fruit or result of good or bad deeds’ “governor have not seen or heard of anyone who says thus or who believes thus why do you say that ‘for this reason there is no other world there is no rebirth of beings after death there is no fruit or result of good or bad deeds’ simile of the moon and the sun “if it is so governor shall cross question you in this matter you may answer as may seem good to you governor what do you think of that which shall say are there moon and sun in this world or in another world are they devas or are they humans “kassapa sir the moon and the sun are in another world not in this world they are devas not humans” maha vagga “by this way of reasoning governor let your belief be like this ‘for this reason there is another world there is rebirth of beings

after death there is no fruit or result of good or bad deeds “kassapa sir there is reason for my holding this belief that there is no other world that there is no rebirth of beings after death there is no fruit or result of good or bad deeds’’ “governor what that reason ‘“kassapa sir in this world have had friends compan ions and relations by blood who took life who took what was not given who committed sexual misconduct who told lies who uttered slanderous words who used harsh speech who talked frivolously who were covetous who were malevolent and who held wrong views sometime after they fell sick were in pain and were gravely ill when knew that they were not going to recover from that illness went to them and said ‘frienis there are some samanas and brahmanas who say and believe that

informed me they have not even sent messen ger to tell me ‘“kassapa sir this is the reason for my holding this belief ‘for this reason there is no other world there is no rebirth of beings after death there is no fruit or result of good or bad deeds’”’ ii simile of the thief “if it is so governor shall cross question you in this matter you may answer as may seem good to you governor what do you think of that in this world should your men having caught thief who had committed offences show him to you and say ‘sir this man is thief who has committed offences in your domain impose on him whatever punishment you wish’” “and you might say to them ‘in that case men bind this man’s arms behind him securely with strong ropes shave his head and lead him around from main road to main road crossroad to crossroad announcing his offences and punish ment to the sound of loud sounding big drum and then leaving from the southern gateway take him to the execution ground south of the town and there cut off his head’ ”” “they might then reply ‘very well’ and might bind the maha vagga man’s arms behind him securely with strong ropes shave his head lead him around from main road to main road from crossroad to crossroad to the sound of loud sounding big drum and then leaving from the southern gateway take him to the execution ground and there make him sit” “the thief might then say to the executioners ‘i have at such and such village or town friends and companions and blood relations shall go and show myself or hidden prop erty to them and then shall come back please wait till then executioners’” “now would his request be granted or would the executioners cut off his head even while he was wailing and lamenting ‘“kassapa sir that thief would not get his request granted should he say ‘i have at such and such village or town friends companions and blood relations shall go and show myself or hidden property to them and then shall come back please wait till then executioners’ actually the executioners would cut off his head even while he was wailing and lamenting” “governor indeed that thief human being would not set his request granted by the executioners who are also human beings should he say to them ‘i have at such and such village or town friends companions and blood relations shall go and show myself or hidden property to them and then shall come back please wait till then executioners how then can your friends companions and blood relations who were in the habit of taking life taking what is not given committing sexual misconduct telling lies uttering slanderous words using harsh speech talking frivolously who are covet ous malevolent and holding wrong views who after death and dissolution of their bodies are reborn in miserable existences in wretched destinations states of ruin and realms of continu ous suffering get their request granted by the guards of niraya should they say to them “we have to go and inform governor payasi ‘for this

friends compan ions and blood relations who abstained from taking life abstained from taking what was not given abstained from committing sexual misconduct abstained from telling lies abstained from uttering slanderous words abstained from using harsh speech abstained from talking frivolously who were not covetous who were not malevolent and who hold right views sometime after they fell sick were in pain and were gravely ill when knew that they were not going to recover from that illness went to them and said ‘friends there are some samanas and brahmanas who say and believe thus “those who abstain from taking life abstain from taking what is not given abstain from committing sexual misconduct abstain from tell ing lies abstain from uttering slanderous words abstain from using harsh speech abstain from talking frivolously who are not covetous are not malevolent and who hold right views will after death and dissolution of their bodies be reborn in good destination the happy world

people will know the meaning of what is said suppose governor there is man sunk in an excreta pit up to his head then you might order your men thus “take that man out of that excreta pit’ they saying ‘very well’ might do so then you might order them thus “wipe off completely with bits of split bamboo the excreta clinging to that man’s body’ they saying “very well’ might do so “then again you might order them thus ‘rub that man’s body well with yellow lime three times’ they might do so then again you might order them thus “rub him with oil and then cleanse him thoroughly with soft bath powder three payasi sutta times they might do so then again you might order them thus “trim that man’s hair and beard and they might do so then again you might order them thus ‘give that man costly garlands costly perfumes and costly garments’ and they might do so then again you might order them thus ‘take that man up on to the upper terrace and provide him with the five sensual pleasures’ they might do so “now governor what do you think of that would that man well bathed well anointed with cosmetics with hair and beard well trimmed garlanded well decked with adornments clad in clean garments staying on the upper terrace and fully and thoroughly enjoying the five kinds of sensual pleasures have any desire to be sunk again in that excreta pit “kassapa sir indeed he would not why is it so kassapa sir is because the unclean excreta pit is foul and has the characteristic of foulness it stinking and has the character istic of stink it is disgusting and has the characteristic of disgust it repulsive and has the characteristic of repulsive ness “in the same way governor to the devas human beings are foul and have the characteristic of foulness are stinking and have the characteristic of stinking are disgusting and have the characteristic of disgust are repulsive and have the char acteristic of repulsiveness governor from hundred yozanas away the odour of humans offends the devas since that is so your friends companions and blood relations who abstained from taking life abstained from taking what is not given abstained from committing sexual misconduct abstained from telling lies abstained from uttering slanderous words abstained from using harsh speech abstained from talking frivolously who were not covetous who were not malevolent and who hold right views should they after death and dissolution of the body be reborn in good destination the happy world of the devas how would they come and inform you ‘for this reason there are other worlds there is rebirth of beings after death there is fruit or result of good or bad deeds’ maha vagga “by this way of reasoning governor let your belief be like this ‘for this reason there is another world there is rebirth of beings after death there is fruit or result of good and bad deeds” “although revered kassapa says thus in this matter my belief is thus ‘for this reason there is no other world there is no rebirth of beings after death there is no fruit or result of good or bad deeds” “governor is there another reason kassapa sir there is another reason for my belief “governor what is that reason ‘“kassapa sir in this world have had friends compan ions and blood relations who abstained from taking life ab stained from taking what is not given abstained from commit ting sexual misconduct abstained from telling lies abstained from taking intoxicants sometime after they fell sick were in pain and were gravely ill when knew that they were not going to recover from that illness went to them and said ‘friends there

tavatimsa devas “if it is so governor shall cross question you in this matter you may answer as may seem good to you governor hundred years in the human world are equivalent to one day in the life of tavatimsa devas thirty of those days and nights are month twelve such months make one year thousand of such years is the life span of the tavatimsa devas if your dear friends companions and blood relations who abstained from taking life abstained from taking what is not given abstained from committing sexual misconduct ab stained from telling lies abstained from taking intoxicants who became companions of the tavatimisa devas should have this thought “let us for two or three days fully and thoroughly enjoy the five kinds of sensual pleasures only after that we shall go and inform governor payasi thus ‘for this reason there is another world there is rebirth of beings after death there is fruit or result of good and bad deeds’ would they be able to come and tell you thus ‘there is another world there is rebirth of beings after death there is fruit or result of good and bad deeds “kassapa sir indeed they would not kassapa sir indeed we would be long dead by then but who has told the revered sir that there are tavatimsa devas or that the tavatimsa devas have such long years of life we do not believe the revered kassapa’s words that there are tavatimsa devas or that the maha vagga tavatinisa devas have such long years of life” simile of the man born blind “governor for example man born blind who could not see objects as black or white as dark blue as yellow as red as dark red as even or uneven who could not see the stars or the sun or the moon were to say there is no object as black or white nor anyone who sees black object or white object there is no object as dark blue yellow red dark red colour nor anyone who sees dark blue object yellow object red object dark red object there is no object which is even or uneven nor anyone who sees an even object or uneven object there are no stars nor anyone who sees the stars there no moon nor sun nor anyone who sees the moon or the sun do not know these things do not see these things therefore these things do not

dark blue objects and people who see dark blue objects there are even objects and uneven objects and people who see even objects and uneven objects there are the stars and people who see the stars there are the moon and the sun and people who see them kassapa sir saying ‘i do not know these things do not see these things therefore they do not exist’ not saying the right thing’ “governor similarly what you have said to me makes it clear that you think just like that blind man you have said to me ‘who has told you kassapa sir that there are tavatimsa devas or that the tavatimisa devas have long years of life we do not believe revered kassapa’s words that there are tavatimsa devas or that the tavatimsa devas have long years of life’ governor it is not to be regarded that other worlds are visible to these physical eyes as you think governor the samanas and brahmanas who resort to remote dwellings deep in forest there practising vigilantly strenuously with mind resolutely directed towards nibbana cultivating the development of the payasi sutta divine power of sight dibbacakkhu nana those samanas and brahmanas with the divine power of sight which is extremely clear surpassing the sight of man can see either this world or another world and see beings reborn after death governor this is how other worlds should be understood other worlds should not be regarded as visible to these physical eyes as you think “by this way of reasoning governor let your belief be thus “there is another world there is rebirth of beings after death there is fruit and result of good or bad deeds’” although revered kassapa says thus in this matter my belief is thus ‘for this reason there is no other world there is no rebirth of beings after death there is no fruit and result of good or bad deeds’ “governor is there another reason ‘“kassapa sir there another reason “governor what is that reason ‘“kassapa sir in this world see samanas and brahmanas who are endowed with morality who are virtuous who wish to live and does not wish to die who desire happiness and loathe suffering kassapa sir when see them this thought occurs to me ‘if these revered samanas and brahmanas who are en dowed with morality and are virtuous know ‘when we die we will be reborn in world better than this’ then these revered samanas and brahmanas who are endowed with morality and are virtuous would either take poison or take weapons and kill themselves or hang themselves or throw themselves down precipice it is because these revered samanas and brahmanas who are endowed with morality and are virtuous do not know ‘when we die we will be reborn in better world than this that they wish to live and do not wish to die and desirous of happiness and loathe suffering and do not kill themselves” “kassapa sir this is the reason for my holding this belief ‘for this reason there is no other world there is no rebirth of beings after death there is no fruit and result of good or bad deeds’ maha vagga vi simile of the pregnant woman “if it is so governor shall give you simile in this world by simile some intelligent people will know the meaning of what is said governor what happened in the past was that certain brahmin had two wives one of the wives had son about ten or twelve years old the other was fully pregnant and near her time then that brahmin died then that young boy said to his mother’s enemy his stepmother ‘lady all this wealth all this store of grain all this silver and all this gold are mine there is nothing for you in respect of these lady make over to me my inheritance from my father’ on this being said the brahmani the stepmother said to him ‘wait dear till my child is born if it is boy portion of the inheritance will be his if it girl she shall serve you’ for second time that young boy said to his mother’s enemy ‘lady all this wealth all this store of grain all this silver and all this gold are mine there is nothing for you in respect of these lady make over to me my inheritance from my father for second time the brahmini said to him ‘wait dear til my child is born if it is boy portion of the inheritance will be his if it is girl she shall serve you’ for third time that young boy said to his mother’s enemy ‘lady all the wealth all this store of grain all this silver and all this gold are mine there is nothing for you in respect of these lady make over to me my inheritance from my father’ “then that brahmini taking knife entered an inner chamber and cut open her abdomen so that boy or girl might be born that woman thus destroyed herself her life her unborn child and all the wealth just as that foolish and senseless woman met with disaster through thoughtless seeking after heritage even so governor you who are foolish and senseless will meet with disaster through thoughtless seeking after the other world governor the samanas and brahmanas who are endowed with morality and virtuousity do not forcibly bring to maturity what is not yet mature like that foolish and payasi sutta senseless brahmini who met with disaster through thoughtless seeking after inheritance indeed they wait for that maturity governor the wise samanas and brahmanas who are endowed with morality and virtuosity should live long governor for as long as the samanas and brahmanas who are endowed with morality and virtuosity remain alive for that long they in many ways will produce abundant merit will act for the welfare and happiness of the good of the world and for the benefit welfare and happiness of devas and men “by this way of reasoning governor let your belief be thus “for this reason there is another world there is rebirth of beings after death there is fruit and result of good or bad deeds’ “although revered kassapa says thus in this matter my belief is thus ‘for this reason there is no other world there is no rebirth of beings after death there is no fruit and result of good or bad deeds’”’ “governor is there another reason “kassapa sir there is reason “governor what is the reason “kassapa sir in this world having caught thief who has committed offences my men showed him to me saying ‘sir this man is thief who committed offences in your domain impose on him whatever punishment you wish’ then said to them ‘in that case men put him while still alive in jar close the mouth of the jar and fasten it up tightly with wet leather apply over it thick layer of moist clay put it on the fireplace and make fire under it’ they replied ‘very well’ and put that man while still alive in jar closed the mouth of the jar and fastened it up tightly with wet leather apply over it thick layer of moist clay put the jar on the fireplace and made fire under it when they knew that the man was dead they took the jar off the fireplace removed the covering layer of clay and slowly opened the mouth of the jar thinking ‘we might see the pali word used in the text is jiva lit life maha vagga consciousness of that man leaving the jar but they did not see the consciousness of that man leaving the jar “kassapa sir this is the reason the evidence for my holding this belief ‘for this reason there is no other world there is no

you governor do you remember having had dreams of an enjoyable park an enjoyable woodland enjoyable ground or an enjoyable lake while having nap in the daytime” “kassapa sir remember having had dreams of an enjoyable park an enjoyable woodland an enjoyable ground or an enjoyable lake while having nap in the daytime” “at that time while you were dreaming were the atten dant women of low or high caste very young or maidens watching over you “kassapa sir at that time the attendant women of low and high caste very young girls and maidens were all watch ing over me’ “now then did the attendant women see your conscious ness entering you or leaving you “no kassapa sir’ “indeed governor if those living attendant women who are alive could not see your consciousness entering or leaving you who are alive how then will you be able to see the consciousness of dead man entering or leaving him “by this way of reasoning governor let your belief be thus ‘for this reason there another world there is rebirth of beings after death there is fruit and result of good or bad deeds” this question was put to paydsi because the revered kassapa knew that paydst held the wrong view that when man is draeming his consciousness leaves his body and wanders about various objects that appear in his dream and re enters his body paydsi sutta although the revered kassapa says thus in this matter my belief is thus ‘for this reason there is no other world there is no rebirth of beings after death there is no fruit and result of good or bad deeds “governor is there another reason “kassapa sir there is another reason “governor what is the reason “kassapa sir in this world having caught thief who has committed offences my men showed him to me saying ‘sir this man is thief who has committed offences in your domain impose on him whatever punishment you wish’ then said to them ‘in that case men weigh him while still alive on the scales then strangle him to death with bow string so that there might be no outgoing or incoming breath and then weigh him again on the scales “they replied ‘very well’ and weighed him while still alive on the scales then strangled him to death with bow string so that there might be no outgoing or incoming breath and then weighed him again on the scales” that man while alive was lighter more supple and more easier to handle but when he was dead he was heavier stiffer and less easy to handle “kassapa sir this is the reason for my holding this belief ‘for this reason there is no other world there is no rebirth of beings after death there is no fruit and result of good or bad deeds’ viii simile of the red hot ball of iron “if it is so governor shall give you simile in this world by simile some intelligent people will know the meaning of what is said suppose governor man weighs on the scales red hot ball of iron ablaze and flaming which had been heated in the fire all day long suppose he later weighs it again on the scales when it has been cooled and its heat has been quenched in which state would that ball of iron be lighter more supple more easy to handle when it is red hot ablaze and flaming or when it is cool and quench maha vagga ‘“kassapa sir that ball of iron when it is red hot ablaze and flaming due to its coming together with the heat and air element will be lighter more supple and more easy to handle than when it is cool and quench as in that state it will lack the combination of the heat element and the air element and it will be heavier stiffer less easy to handle” “even so governor this body when it is in conjunction with the life principle body heat and consciousness is lighter more supple and more easy to handle when it is not accom panied by the life principle body heat and consciousness it heavier stiffer and less easy to handle” “by this means of reasoning governor let your belief be thus ‘for this reason there is another world there rebirth of beings after death there ts fruit and result of good and bad deeds” “although revered kassapa says thus in this matter my belief is thus ‘for this reason there is no other world there is no rebirth of beings after death there is no fruit and result of good or bad deeds” “governor is there another “kassapa sir there another reason “governor what is that reason “kassapa sir in this world having caught thief who has committed offences my men showed him to me saying ‘sir this man is thief who has committed offences in your domain impose on him whatever punishment you wish’ then said to them ‘in that case men without destroying the outer skin the under skin the flesh the sinews the bones the marrow deprive this man of his life we might see his consciousness leaving “they replied “very well’ and without destroying the outer skin the under skin the flesh the sinews the bones the marrow they deprived that man of his life” when that thief was at the point of death said to the men ‘in that case men lay this man on his back we might see his consciousness leave they laid that man on his back but we did not see his payasi sutta consciousness leave then said to them ‘in that case men lay him prone face downward lay him on his side lay him on his other side stand him up upright stand him on his head strike him with the hand hit him with stones beat him with sticks cut him with swords on this side on that side again and again we might see his consciousness leaving” “those men struck that man as they were told from this side from that side from all sides but we did not see his consciousness leave that man had eyes and there were visible objects but there was no perception by those eyes he had ears and there were sounds but there was no hearing by those ears he had nose and there were odours but there was no smelling by that nose he had tongue and there were tastes but there was no savouring of those tastes by that tongue he had body and there were tangible objects but there was no sensation of touch of those tangible objects by that body” “kassapa sir this is the reason the evidence for my holding this belief ‘for this reason there is no other world there is no rebirth of beings after death there is no fruit and result of good or bad deeds’ ix simile of the conch blower “if it is so governor shall give you simile in this world by simile some intelligent people will know the meaning of what is said governor what happened in the past was that certain conch blower taking his conch went to the border countryside he went to certain village and having got there stood in the middle of the village and blew the conch three times he then laid the conch on the ground and sat at suitable place then governor the people of the border village thought ‘friends what is this sound that is so delight ful so desirable so intoxicating so enticing so entrancing they then assembled together and asked the conch blower ‘friends what is this sound that is so delightful so desirable so intoxicating so enticing so entrancing ‘friends this is called conch the sound that is delight ful so desirable so intoxicating so enticing so entrancing is maha vagga its sound’ “then they laid the conch face up and said to it “o conch make sound conch make sound that conch did not make any sound then they laid the conch face down laid it on one side laid it on the other side placed it upright placed it upside down they struck it with hands hit it with stones beat it with sticks cut it with swords beat it on this side on that side again and again they said to it ‘make sound conch make sound conch that conch did not make sound “governor then the conch blower thought “these border village people are so stupid why do they seek so senselessly for the sound of the conch’ while the villagers were looking on the conch blower held the conch blew on it three times and taking it left “then governor the people of the border village thought thus ‘indeed friends this thing called conch makes sound only when it in conjunction with man blower effort the act of blowing and air that is blown friends this thing called conch does not make any sound when it is not tn conjunction with man effort or air “in the same way governor when this body is in con junction with life principle body heat and consciousness it moves forward moves backward stands sits lies down it sees visible objects with the eye it hears sounds with the ear it smells odours with the nose it savours taste with the tongue it feels tangible objects with the body and cognizes mind objects with the mind when this body is not in conjunction with life principle body heat and consciousness it does not move forward nor move backward nor stand nor sit nor lie down it does not see visible objects with the eye does not hear with the ear does not smell odours with the nose does not savour tastes with the tongue does not feel tangible objects with the body does not cognize mind objects with the mind” “by this means of reasoning governor let your belief be thus ‘for this reason there is another world there is rebirth of beings after death there is fruit and result of good or bad payasi sutta deeds’”’’ “although the revered kassapa says thus in this matter my belief is thus ‘for this reason there is no other world there is no rebirth of beings after death there is no fruit and result of good or bad deeds’” “governor is there another reason “kassapa sir there is reason “governor what is that reason “kassapa sir in this world having caught thief who has committed offences my men showed him to me saying ‘sir this man is thief who has committed offences in your domain impose on him whatever punishment you wish’ then said to them ‘in that case men flay his outer skin we might see his consciousness’ they flayed that man we did not see his consciousness said to them ‘in that case man remove his under skin cut out the flesh cut the sinews break his bones extract the bone marrow and we might see his con sciousness’ they extracted his bone marrow and still we did not see his consciousness “kassapa sir this is the reason for my holding this belief ‘for this reason there is no other world there is no rebirth of beings after death there is no fruit and result of good or bad deeds” simile of the fire worshipping ascetic “if it is so governor shall give you simile in this world by simile some intelligent people will know the meaning of what is said governor what happened in the past was that certain fire worshipping ascetic was living in leaf roofed hut in forest governor about that time caravan of carts was travelling through the countryside and encamped for one night near the hermitage of the fire worshipping ascetic and then went away then governor the fire worshipping ascetic had this thought ‘it would be good if were to go to where the caravan encamped might get something useful for myself “then the fire worshipping ascetic rose early and went to maha vagga where the caravan had encamped there at the site of the camp he saw an abandoned male child who was very young and weak who was only able to lie on its back then the ascetic thought thus ‘it would not be proper for me that should let human being die while look on will carry this infant to my hermitage and foster tend and rear it’ then the fire worshipping ascetic carried the boy to his hermitage and fostered tended and reared it when the boy got to the age of ten or twelve years there arose some business or other for the fire worshipping ascetic to do in the countryside then the fire worshipping ascetic said to the boy “dear boy wish to go to the countryside dear boy tend the fire don’t let it go out if it should go out here is an adze here are pieces of firewood and here is set of drill stick and drill block rekindle the fire should it go out and tend to it’ “having instructed the boy thus the fire worshipping ascetic went to the countryside while the boy was playing the fire went out then the boy thought thus ‘father told me dear boy tend to the fire don’t let it go out if it should go out here is an adze here are pieces of firewood and here is set of stick and drill block rekindle the fire and tend to it’ now then it would be well for me if were to rekindle the fire and tend to it then the boy hacked the set of fire drill with the adze thinking ‘perhaps in this way might get fire’ he did not get any fire he split the fire drill into two pieces into three four five ten hundred pieces he chopped it up into small bits and pounded them in mortar having pounded them in mortar he scattered them in strong wind thinking ‘perhaps in this way might get fire’ he did not get any fire then the fire worshipping ascetic having finished his business in the countryside came back to the hermitage and asked the boy ‘dear boy how is it is your fire still going the boy said ‘father while was playing here the fire went out father then thought ‘now then it would be well for me if were to rekindle the fire and tend to it’ then hacked the payasi sutta set of fire drill with the adze thinking ‘perhaps in this way might get fire’ did not get fire split the fire drill into two pieces into three four five ten and hundred pieces chopped it up into small pieces and pounded them in mortar scattered them in strong wind thinking ‘perhaps in this way might get fire but did not get any fire “then the fire worshipping ascetic thought ‘how foolish how unintelligent this boy is why should he be seeking fire in this senseless manner while the boy was looking on the ascetic took set of fire drill and making fire said to him ‘dear boy this is how fire should be made not as you so foolish and unintelligent seek to make fire senselessly’ “in the same way governor you being foolish and unintelligent seek another world senselessly give up gover nor this evil wrong view give up governor this evil wrong view do not let disadvantage and suffering that will last long time happen to you” “even though the revered kassapa says thus am not able to give up this evil wrong view king pasenadi of kosala knows me and also the kings of foreign countries know me as holding the creed and the belief ‘for this reason there is no other world there is no rebirth of beings after death there is no fruit and result of good or bad deeds kassapa sir if should give up this evil wrong view there will be people who say to me ‘how foolish how unintelligent governor payasi is to have held on to this evil wrong view’ shall stick to it in anger against them shall stick to it to refute them and shall stick to it to oppose them” xi simile of the two caravan leaders “if it is so governor shall give you simile in this world by simile some intelligent people will know the meaning of what is said “governor what happened in the past was that great caravan of thousand carts was going from country in the east to country in the west wherever it in the pali text only ‘kalapa’ quiver is mentioned maha vagga reached grass firewood water and green leaves were soon exhausted in that great caravan there were two caravan lead ers each leading five hundred carts then those caravan leaders had this thought “there are thousand carts in this great caravan wherever we go grass firewood water and green leaves are soon exhausted it would be good if we were to divide this caravan into two groups each containing five hundred carts’ “they then divided the caravan into two groups each containing five hundred carts one of the caravan leaders having taken on large quantities of grass firewood and water caused his caravan to set out after they had proceeded two or three days that leader saw swarthy red eyed man armed with bow and quiver of arrows wearing lotus flowers with wet clothes and wet hair coming from the opposite direction in an excellent carriage with mud splattered wheels seeing him the caravan leader said ‘friend from where have you come ‘from such and such country’ ‘where are you going ‘to such and such country’ ‘friend how is it has it been raining very heavily in the stretch of journey ahead ‘it is so friend it has been raining very heavily in the stretch of journey ahead the road tracks are covered with water there are large quantities of grass firewood and water friend throw away the grass firewood and water you have go quickly with lightly laden carts let not the oxen be unduly tired’ then the caravan leader said to the cartmen ‘friends this man says it has been raining very heavily in the stretch of journey ahead the road tracks are covered with water friends throw away the old stack of grass firewood and water that you have go quickly with lightly laden carts let not the oxen be tired friends throw away the old stock of grass firewood and water that we have drive on the caravan with lightly laden carts’ the cartmen replied ‘very well sir to the caravan payasi sutta leader and throwing away the old stock of grass firewood and water that they had drove the caravan on with lightly laden carts at the first camp lit caravan resting place they did not find any grass firewood or water at the second camp also at the third camp also at the fourth camp also at the fifth camp also at the sixth camp also at the seventh camp also they did not find any grass firewood or water all of them met with ruin and destruction the demon under human disguise yakkha devoured all the men and the cattle in that caravan only the bones remained when the second caravan leader knew that it had been long time since ‘that caravan had left he took on large quantities of grass firewood and water and caused the caravan to set out after they had proceeded two or three days that leader saw swarthy red eyed man armed with bow and quiver of arrows wearing lotus flowers with wet clothes and wet hair coming from the opposite direction in an excellent carriage with mud splattered wheels seeing him the caravan leader said ‘friend from where have you come ‘from such and such country’ ‘where are you going to ‘to such and such country’ ‘friend how is it has it been raining very heavily in the stretch of journey ahead ‘it is so friend it has been raining very heavily in the stretch of journey ahead the road tracks are covered with water there are large quantities of grass firewood and water friend throw away the grass fire wood and water that you have go quickly with lightly laden carts let not the oxen be unduly tired then the caravan leader said to the cartmen ‘friends this man says “it has been raining very heavily in the stretch of journey ahead the road tracks are covered with water there are large quantities of grass firewood and water throw away the grass firewood and water that you have go quickly with lightly laden carts let not the oxen be unduly tired’ friends this man is neither our maha vagga friend nor our blood relation why should we believe him and go as he says those old stock of grass firewood and water that we have should not be thrown away drive on the caravan with all the goods we have we will not throw away the old stock that we have “those cartmen assented replying ‘very well sir’ to the caravan leader and drove on the caravan with all the goods they had at the first camp they did not find any grass firewood or water at the second camp also at the third camp also at the fourth camp also at the fifth camp also at the sixth camp also at the seventh camp also they did not find any grass firewood or water they found only that caravan which had met with ruin and destruction they found only the bones of the men and the cattle from that caravan having been devoured by the yakkha under human disguise “then that caravan leader said to the cartmen ‘friends that caravan met with ruin and destruction due to the leader ship of the foolish caravan leader that being the case friends throw away these wares of little value from our caravan and take from that caravan such wares as are of great value” “the cartmen assented replying ‘very well sir’ to the caravan leader and threw away their wares of little value and took on wares of great value from that caravan and got the journey over safely under the leadership of that wise caravan leader” “in the same way governor you being foolish and unintelligent in senselessly seeking another world will meet with ruin and destruction like that first caravan leader those who think your words should be listened to should be be lieved will also meet with ruin and destruction like those members of the first caravan give up governor this evil wrong view give up governor this evil wrong view do not let disadvantage and suffering that will last long time happen to you” “even though the revered kassapa says so am not able to give up this evil wrong

result of good or bad deeds kassapa sir if should give up this evil wrong view there will be people who say of me ‘how foolish how unintelligent governor paydsi is to have held on to this evil wrong view shall stick to it in anger against them shall stick to it to refute them shall stick to it to oppose them” xii simile of one who carries away excrements “if it so governor shall give you simile in this world by means of simile some intelligent people will know the meaning of what is said “governor what happened in the past was that certain pig breeder went from his village to another village there he saw large heap of dry excrements which had been thrown away seeing that he thought “this is lot of dry excrements thrown away it will be good for my pigs it would be good if were to carry away the dry excrements from here’ that man spread his upper robe put the large amount of dry excrements on it tied it into bundle and carrying it on his head went away during his journey before he reached his village there was heavy downpour of rain he went on carrying the bundle of excrement that was oozing and flowing out so that he was smeared all over with excrements down to the tips of his fingernails and toenails “seeing that man people said to him “man are you mad is your mind deranged why are you carrying that bundle of excrement which is oozing and flowing out so that you are smeared all over with excrements down to the tips of your fingernails and toenails the man replied ‘indeed it is you who are mad it is you whose minds are deranged this bundle of excrement is my pigfeed’ “governor inthe same way it is evident that you are maha vagga like one in the simile who carried the bundle of excrement give up governor this evil wrong view give up governor this evil wrong view do not let disadvantage and suffering that will last long time happen to you” “even though the revered kassapa says so am not able to give up this evil wrong view king pasenadi of kosala and also the kings of foreign countries know me as ‘governor payasi holds this creed and this belief “for this reason there is no other world there is no rebirth of beings after death there is no fruit and result of good or bad deeds’ shall stick to it in anger against them shall stick to it to refute them shall stick to it to oppose them” xiii simile of the dice player “if it is so governor shall give you simile in this world by means of simile some intelligent people will know the meaning of what is said” “governor what happened in the past was that two dice players were playing dice one of the dice players swallowed every losing dice that fell the other dice player saw that player swallowing every losing dice that fell seeing that he said to the first player ‘friend you certainly have won friend give me the dice shall make an offering of them to the devas ‘very well friend’ said the dice player and handed over the dice to the second dice player then the second player smeared poison on the dice and said to the first player ‘come friend let us play dice’ the first player replied “very well friend’ and they played dice for second time the second time also the first dice player swallowed every losing dice that fell the second player saw that player swallowing every losing dice that fell seeing that he said to that dice player “the man swallowing the dice does not know it has been smeared over with an extremely strong poison swallow you wicked dice player swallow soon bitter fate will be yours” “in the same way governor it is evident that you are like the first dice player in the simile give up governor this evil payasi sutta wrong view give up governor this evil wrong view do not let disadvantage and suffering that will last long time happen to you” “even though the revered kassapa says so am not able to give up this evil wrong view king pasenadi of kosala and also the kings of foreign countries know me as ‘governor payasi holds this creed and this belief ‘for this reason there is no other world there is no rebirth of beings after death there is no fruit and result of good or bad deeds’ kassapa sir if should give up this evil wrong view there will be people who say of me ‘how foolish how unintelligent governor payasi is to have held on to this evil wrong view shall stick to it in anger against them shall stick to it to refute them shall stick to it to oppose them’ xiv simile of the man who carried hemp “if it is so governor shall give you simile in this world by simile some intelligent people will know the meaning of what is said governor what happened in the past was that certain village tract moved away then man said to his friend ‘come friend let us go to the site of that village tract perhaps we might get some valuable things there his friend agreed replying ‘very well friend’ then they went to village within that village tract seeing there large amount of hemp which had been thrown away one of them said to his friend ‘friend here is great deal of hemp thrown away so friend you bundle up load of hemp and also will bundle up load of hemp we both will take bundle of hemp each and go’ his friend agreed saying ‘very well friend’ and making two loads of hemp the two friends carried them away and went to another village there they saw large amount of hemp thread which had been thrown away seeing that one of the friends said to the other ‘friends one needs hemp to get hemp thread this large amount of hemp thread has been thrown away so friend throw away your load of hemp and also will throw away my load of hemp let us both carry bundle of hemp thread each maha vagga and go away’ his friend said ‘friend have carried this load of hemp long way it is also well tied up this is enough for me for yourself you may make your own choice’ then the first friend threw away the load of hemp and took away bundle of hemp thread they then went to the site of another village there they saw large amount of hemp cloth which had been thrown away seeing that one of the friends said to the other ‘friend one needs hemp or hemp thread to get hemp cloth here is large amount of hemp cloth thrown away so friend throw away the load of hemp and also will throw away my load of hemp thread let us both carry bundle of hemp cloth each and go away his friend said ‘friend have carried this load of hemp long way it is also well tied up this is enough for me for yourself you may make your own choice’ then the first friend threw away the load of hemp thread and took away bundle of hemp cloth then they went to the site of another village there they saw large amount of thrown away flax seeing that seeing large amount of thrown away linen thread seeing large amount of thrown away linen cloth seeing large amount of thrown away cotton seeing large amount of thrown away cotton thread seeing large amount of thrown away cotton cloth seeing large amount of thrown away iron seeing large amount of thrown away copper as before seeing large amount of thrown away lead as before seeing large amount of thrown away tin seeing large amount of thrown away silver seeing large amount of thrown away gold the first friend said to the other ‘friend one needs hemp or hemp thread or hemp cloth or flax or linen thread or linen cloth or cotton or cotton thread or cotton cloth or iron or copper or lead or tin or silver to get gold here is large amount of gold thrown away so friend throw away the load of hemp and also will throw away the load of silver let us both carry away load of gold each and payasi sutta go away’ his friend said ‘friend have carried this load of hemp long away it is also well tied up this is enough for me for yourself you may make your own choice’ then the first friend threw away the load of silver and took away load of gold then they went back to their own village of the two friends the parents the wife sons and daughters the friends and companions of the friend who had brought the load of hemp were not pleased with him for that reason he gained neither happiness nor satisfaction but the parents the wife sons and daughters the friends and companions of the friend who had brought the load of gold were pleased with him for that reason he gained happiness and satisfaction “in the same way governor it evident that you are like the one in this simile who carried the load of hemp give up governor this evil wrong view give up governor this evil wrong view do not let disadvantage and suffering that will last long time happen to you” taking refuge in the three gems “even by the first simile of the revered kassapa was pleased and very much satisfied to the point of accep tance but thought should seem to oppose the revered kassapa only because wanted to hear the wonderfully intel ligent answers to the questions kassapa it is excellent kassapa it is excellent the revered kassapa has taught the dhamma in many ways it is “o kassapa as if one turns up what lies upside down as if one uncovers what lies covered as if one shows the way to another who is lost as if one holds up lamp in the darkness for those with eyes to see visible objects kassapa sir take refuge in the revered gotama take refuge in the dhamma and take refuge in the samgha may the revered kassapa regard me as lay disciple who has taken refuge in the buddha the dhamma and the samgha from today onwards till the end of my life” “o kassapa sir maha vagga wish to make great sacrificial offering please instruct me “q kassapa on that offering which will bring me benefit and happiness for long time” exposition on sacrificial offerings “governor there are sacrificial offerings in which oxen are slain goats are slain fowls and pigs are slain in which various living things meet with death and where the recipients of the offerings are holders of wrong view wrong thinking wrong speech wrong action wrong livelihood wrong effort wrong mindfulness and wrong concentration governor such sacrificial offerings are not of great benefit are not of great advantage are not of great splendour and are not at all pervading for example governor if cultivator were to enter wood taking with him seed and plough and in bad field of very uneven ground where stumps and thorny obstacles had not been removed were to plant seeds that were broken rotten damaged by wind and sun with no kernel intact not properly stored and there were not sufficient rain in season then would those seeds grow prosper and attain full develop ment and would the cultivator gain much benefit “no indeed kassapa sir’ “in the same way governor there are sacrificial offer ings in which oxen are slain goats are slain fowls and pigs are slain in which various living things meet with death and at which the recipients of the offerings are holders of wrong view wrong thinking wrong speech wrong actions wrong livelihood wrong effort wrong mindfulness and wrong concen tration governor such sacrificial offerings are not of great benefit are not of great advantage are not of great splendour and are not all pervading governor there are offerings in which oxen are not slain goats are not slain fowls and pigs are not slain in which various living things do not meet with death and at which the recipients of the offerings are holders of right view right thinking right speech right actions right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentra tion governor such sacrificial offerings are of great benefit payasi sutta are of great advantage are of great splendour and are all pervading” “for example governor if cultivator were to enter wood taking with him seed and plough and in good field of even ground where stumps and thorny obstacles had been removed were to plant seeds that were not broken not rotten not damaged by wind or sun with good kernel intact properly stored and if there were sufficient rain in season then would those seeds grow prosper and attain full development and would the cultivator gain much benefit “yes indeed kassapa sir’ “in the same way governor there are offerings in which oxen are not slain goats are not slain fowls and pigs are not slain and various living things do not meet with death and where the recipients of the offerings are holders of right view right thinking right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration governor such offerings are of great benefit great advantage great splendour and are all pervading” the story of young uttara then governor payasi arranged for offerings to be made to samanas and brahmanas solitary indigents wayfarers alms seekers and beggars the offerings were such foods as porridge of broken rice with sour gruel and coarse with knots and loose threads thick clothing the giving of offerings was supervised by young man by the name of uttara that young man uttara in making the offerings expressed this wish “by this alms giving may be associated with governor payasi only in this existence but not in another’ governor payasi heard that the young man uttara in making the offerings had expressed the wish ‘by this alms giving may be associated eve ee ee the venerable gavanipati was disciple of the buddha and was an arahat he was born deva in the catumahiarajika deva realm in one of his previous existences and had occupied this serisaka mansion when he became an arahat in this existence he remembered this mansion and used to go there continually to spend the day maha vagga with governor payasi only in this existence but not in an other’ then governor payasi called the young man uttara to him and asked him “is it true uttara that in making the offerings you expressed the wish ‘by this alms giving may be associated with governor payasi only in this existence but not in another “sir it true” “but why uttara do you express the wish ‘by this alms giving may be associated with governor pay asi only in this existence but not in another uttara surely we desire of merit and hope for the fruits of alms giving do we not “at your lordship’s alms giving such foods as porridge of broken rice with sour gruel are given that kind of food your lordship will not even want to touch with your foot much less eat coarse thick clothings are given that kind of clothing your lordship will not even want to touch with your foot much less wear indeed we love and respect you how can we combine what is agreeable with what is disagreeable “in that case uttara give as offerings the kind of food that eat the kind of clothing that wear” “very well sir replied the young man uttara and gave as offerings the kind of food governor payasi ate and the kind of clothing governor payasi wore then because he had made the offerings without due respect without giving them personally with his own hands without enthusiasm and as if discarding them governor payasi on the death and dissolution of the body became only companion of the catumaharajika devas in the empty serisaka mansion but the young man uttara who supervised the giving of offerings because he had made the offerings with due respect giving them with his own hands with enthusiasm and not as if discarding them on the death and dissolution of his body reached happy destination as companion of the tavatimsa devas the story of the payasi deva at that time the venerable gavanipati was in the habit of continually going to the empty serisaka mansion to spend the day then paydsi deva approached the venerable gavamipati’ and having paid homage to him stood at suitable place to payadsi deva who was thus standing the venerable gavampati asked “who are you friend “venerable sir was the governor payasi’” “friend did you not have the belief ‘for this reason there is no other world there is no rebirth of beings after death there is no fruit and result of good or bad deeds ’” it is true venerable sir held the belief ‘for this reason there is no other world there is no rebirth of beings after death there is no fruit and result of good or bad deeds but the revered kumara kassapa dissuaded me from that evil wrong view “friend where has the young man uttara who super vised your alms giving been reborn “venerable sir the young man uttara who supervised my alms giving because he had made the offerings with due respect giving them person ally with his own hands with enthusiasm and not as if discarding them has on the death and dissolution of his body reached happy destination as companion of the tavatimsa devas but venerable sir as for me because gave the offerings without due respect not with my own hands without enthusiasm and as if discarding them on the death and dissolution of my body became only companion of the catumaharajika devas in the empty serisaka mansion therefore when the venerable gavampati goes back to the world of humans please tell them thus ‘give offerings with due respect give with your own hands give with enthusiasm do not give the offerings as if discarding them the governor of paydsi because he had made the offerings without due respect without giving them with his own hands without enthusiasm and as if discarding them had on the death and dissolution of his body became only companion of the catumaharajika devas but the young man maha vagga uttara who supervised his alms giving because he had made the offerings with due respect giving them personally with his own hands with enthusiasm and not as if discarding them had on the death and dissolution of his body reached happy destination as companion of the tavatimsa devas then the venerable gavampati came back to the world of humans and told them thus “give offerings with due respect give with your own hands give with enthusiasm do not give the offerings as if discarding them the governor payasi because he had made the offerings without due respect without giving them with his own hands without enthusiasm and as if discarding them had on the death and dissolution of his body became only companion of the catumaharajika devas but the young man uttara who supervised his alms giving because he had made the offerings with due respect giving them personally with his own hands with enthusiasm and not as if discarding them had on the death and dissolution of his body reached happy destination as companion of the tavatimsa devas” end of the payasi sutta the tenth in

promotion and propagation of the sasana kaba aye yangon dated december digha nikaya pathika vagga pali introduction pathika vagga pali is the third of the three divisions or vaggas that makes up the digha nikaya the collection of long discourses by the buddha it is named after the pathika sutta the first of the eleven suttas comprising the vagga of these eleven suttas in this vagga four of them viz cakkavatti sutta sampasadaniya sutta pasadika sutta singala sutta are already included in the ten suttas from diganikaya in the present book all the eleven suttas are included of the eleven suttas in this vaggas three of them the sampasddaniya suttas the sangiti sutta and the dasuttara sutta are discourses given by the venerable sariputta the remaining eight taught by the buddha himself some of the discourses given by the buddha are appro priate to the occasion as it arises while sometimes he gave specific words of admonition or instruction to suit the tempera ment and intelligence of particular hearer after judging by his all seeing knowledge the readiness of the hearer to receive the advice accordingly the reader will find in this vagga variety of discourses each different in the subject matter or on the mode of teaching brief summary of the eleven discourses will be given here so that the reader may have general background knowledge about them pathika sutta when the buddha was staying at the market town of anupiya in the province of the mallas he paid visit on his alms round to the hermitage of bhagava an ascetic there he vi introduction was welcomed by bhagava who related to him about his friend sunnakkhatta this friend of his was lacchavi prince who had been bhikkhu under the buddha after three years of bhikkhu hood he left the order on the ground that the buddha did not show feats of miraculous powers and also did not tell him the beginning of the world after leaving the order sunakkhatta went to his friend bhagava the ascetic and told him that he had forsaken the buddha this news was reported to the buddha by bhagava the buddha told bhagava how sunakkhatta even as bhikkhu had high opinions about naked ascetics and how he instigated pathikaputta the ascetic to compete with the buddha in showing feats of miraculous powers pathikaputta however did not even dare to face the buddha and went into hiding explained the buddha to bhagava ii udumbarika sutta ascetic nigrodha residing at the udumbarika monastic complex at rajagaha was engaged in loud discussion with his followers on all sorts of unprofitable talk at that time sandhana the householder disciple of the buddha happened to be on the scene quite accidentally thereupon sandhana remarked that his teacher the buddha never indulges in such noisy talk but resorts to quiet forest abodes then nigrodha the ascetic retorted “samana gotama does not dare to speak in assemblies that’s why he shies away from gatherings and hides himself in out of the way places just as he was making that slanderous speech the buddha made his appearance unexpectedly ascetic nigrodha welcomed the bud dha and then said to the bhagava “with what sort of teaching does the revered gotama instruct his disciples” the buddha replied “as one holding different view you will not easily understand the teaching give to my disciples you had better ask questions concerning your own doctrine ascetic nigrodha’s doctrine consisted in washing away evil by means of extreme ascetic practice known as tapojiguccha introduction vil he therefore put this question to the buddha “in what manner is the practice of tapojiguccha well accomplished in what manner is tapojiguccha poorly practised the buddha explained the impurities surrounding the practice of tapojiguccha and pro ceeded to define at length the tapojiguccha practice that is pure and the tapojiguccha practice that is impure iii cakkavatti sutta in this discourse made by the buddha at matula town in the province of magadha the buddha exhorted the bhikkhus to remain making the four methods of stedfast mindfulness as their sole reliance then he continued to discourse on the advantages of consistant practice of meritorious dhammas and how benefits both mundane and supramundane grow by such practice in this connection he referred to the story of dalhanemi universal monarch dalhanemi and long line of his successors consistenlly adopted the practice pertaining to the universal monarch with the result that they reigned supreme over the entire expanse of the earth bounded by the four great oceans when it came to the reign of the seventh king the usual practice pertaining to the universal monarch was neglected consequently the people be came immoral killing stealing and all such wicked deeds came to be committed human life spans gradually declined when the life span stayed at ten years chaos the world dreadful era of mass killings decimated the population then those few who survived the scourge repented and took up meritorious dhammas again such as refraining from killing as consequence human life span would be doubled to twenty years after the trend of growth of the life span reached infinity reversal would take place when it declined to eighty thousand years there would arise metteyya buddha vill introduction thus the buddha extolled the virtue of taking up meritorious dhammas that ensure long life good appearance and prosperity as for bhikkhus he laid stress on the need for life dedicated to the four methods of steadfast mindfulness iv agganna sutta this discourse was given to two novices sdmaneras known as vasettha and bharadvaja during the buddha’s stay at the pubbarama monastery in savatthi it was in response to the statement said to be by brahmins that “brahmins alone are the noblest of men because they were born from mouth of brahma” the buddha replied that brahmins say so because they do not know how the human species evolved at the beginning of the world he proceeded to discourse on how mankind evolved at the primordal days and how the four different castes known as kkhattiya brahmana vessa and suddha appeared then the buddha explained how anyone belonging to any of those four castes at his or her death is destined according to his her own actions the evil doer goes to the four miserable existences the doer of good deeds to the happy destinations of devas as matter of fact dhamma is the noblest in the world anyone who cultivates the thirty seven factors which are the associates of enlightenment bodhipakkhiya dhamma dhammas attains to in this very life the extinction of defilements said the buddha sampasadaniya sutta during the buddha’s sojourn at the pavarika mango grove near the city of nalanda the venerable sariputta ap proached the buddha and said “in the matter of discerning the dhamma there never lived in the past any samana or brahmana nor will there be any samana or brahmana in the future nor is here any samana or brahmana living in the present who sur passes the bhagava and that he sariputta believed it so introduction thereupon the buddha said to riputta ‘sariputta do you possess special power of seeing with your mind the minds of the buddhas that belong to the past the future and the present “venerable sir do not replied sariputta “and yet why do you make this bold steatment like the roar of the lion “venerable sir although do not possess any special power that enables me to see with my mind the minds of the buddhas know that all the buddhas are established in the four methods of steadfast mindfulness and cultivate the seven factors of enlightenment bojjhanga where they attain perfect self enlightenment this knowledge by inference from the usual conduct of the buddhas that has arisen in me makes me bold enough to pronounce such sweeping statement the venerable sariputta continued with praise for the buddha’s various discourses that were excellent and inspiring he said that after hearing these discourses his devotion to the buddha increased by leaps and bounds in fact the discourse came to be known as sampasadaniya sutta because of its vivid portrayal of the buddha’s glorious virtues vi pasadika sutta this sutta was delivered during the buddha’s sojourn at the market town of vedhafifia in the province of sakka at that time ataputta the leader of the niganta sect had died in the city of pava leaving his followers in bitter dissension among themselves this news reached the buddha through the vener able nanda who had passed his rains retreat period in pava the buddha remarked that dissension among adherents of deficient teaching propounded by teacher who was not perfectly self enlighented was only to be expected he then introduction defined defecient teaching as against complete teaching he further elaborated on the features of complete teaching he proceeded to reassure his disciples that he had perfect knowledge of all true dhammas that he had taught them well and laid before them the perfect practice accordingly he urged his disciples to have recourse to the thirth seven associates of enlightenment comprising the four methods of steadfast mind fulness the four right exertions etc that he had taught at the same time they should find no cause for dissension in these teachings but should recite them in unison and remember them well in closing the discourse the buddha said that since this discourse aroused piety and delight in the hearer let it be known as the ‘delectable discourse’ pasadika sutta vil lakkhana sutta the lakkhana sutta discoursed by the buddha at the jetavana monastery in savatthi deals with the marks of great man mahapurisa the term ‘mahapurisa’ denotes man of noble caste clan or family if man endowed with the marks of great man were to remain in lay life he is destined to become the universal monarch reigning over the four island continments if he leaves hearth and home to become bhikkhu he is sure to gain supreme enlightenment the knower of all knowable things by his own intellect and insight the buddha the possessor of these distinctive marks on his body has just these two possibilities open to him the buddha declared in this sutta the buddha enumerates the marks one by one then he explains the specific merits earned as human aspirant to buddhahood in his long long past that have bloomed forth for every mark there had previously been causative merit particular merit however might be responisible for the appearance of two or three marks that is why there are twenty kinds of past merit as against marks introduction xi as matter of fact the buddha to be who went through the period of four asankheyyas and hundred thousand aeons kappas perfecting himself morally had been reborn in various forms of existence other than the human existence the merits done in those other existences such as deva brahma or animal would not be easy to account for hence merits performed only as human being during that long period has been retold thus explains the commentary vi singala sutta this suttas is commonly known as singalovada sutta because it contains the buddha’s advice to singala youth it was taught by the buddha during his stay at the veluvana monastery in rajagaha while the buddha was on his alms round in the city of rajagaha he met youth named singala who was worshipping the six directions such as east west etc on making an inquiry by the buddha the youth explained that he was dutifully carrying out his father’s instructions made when he was about to die the buddha explained to the youth that under ariya teaching the six direction do not mean the six cardinal points but the six persons such as one’s parents teachers etc proper discharge of one’s duties to those six persons means worshipping them then one’s duties towards each of them was explained in as much as one has to do one’s duties towards one’s parents the parents also have their duties towards their offspring thus there is reciprocity of social duties as between father and son pupil and teacher etc before describing those six kinds of social duties the buddha advised the youth on the four defiling practices the four factors instigating evil acts the six evil ways that dissipate one’s wealth the six bad effects of indulging in intoxicant as well as on characteristics of false friends and true friends xi introduction as this discourse gives comprehensive account of social duties and conduct the commentary suggests that it might be called gihivinaya set of rules for lay persons after listening to the discourse singala the youth ac quired the right view and obtained discipleship under the bud dha ix atanatiya sutta during the buddha stay at the gijjakuta mountain near rajagaha the four great deva kings led by vessavana together with their retinues came before the buddha and recited to him the protective stanzas composed by them meant to protect bhikkhus and bhikkhunis against the harassment that might be expected from some yakkhas or powerful ogres these protective stanzas composed at the deva city of atanata whence the name atanatiya came into vogue con tained words of devotion for the seven buddhas beginning with vipassi buddhas by the four great deva kings as well as by such powerful yakkhas as gandhabbas and kumbandas the four great deva kings repectfully told the buddha that those stanzas would make bhikkhus and bhikkhunis safe against harassment by yakkhas in case yakkas were to prove threat to any one of the bhikkhu community the aggreived one would bring the matter to the notice of twenty eight deva generals such as inda varuna etc on the next morning the buddha related the event to his bhikkhu disciples and recited the protective stanzas to them he also advised them to recite the same as protiection against evil yakkhas today the myanmar buddhists recite the eleven parittas in which atanatiya paritta is included this paritta is compo sition by the ancient teachers based on the seven devotional stanzas contained in the pali text introduction xu sangiti sutta on certain occasion the buddha was making tour of the province of mallas when he got to the city of pava the malla princes invited the buddha and five hundred bhikkhus to the city hall where they listened to discourse by the buddha given in the early part of the night when the malla princes left the congregation hall after the discourse was ended the buddha asked the venerable sariputta to give discourse to the five hundred bhikkhus it was during the time when nigantha nataputta teacher of the nigantha sect had just died and his disciples were locked in dissension refering to them the venerable sariputta said that the niganthas were in disarray because nataputta was not perfectly enlightened buddha and his teachings were taught in bad way that was why his pupils were now in disarray the buddha on the other hand was perfectly self enlightened one and taught the dhamma in the right manner that being so all the bhikkhu disciples should not engage themselves in arguements about the dhamma they should recite the dhamma in unison by doing so the noble practice would last long to the benefit of men and devas having made this preliminary talk the venerable sariputta discoursed on the dhammas that were grouped into single dhammas two dhammas three dhammas four dhammias etc progressing up to ten dhammas in doing so in the category of single dhammas he declared that nutriment or food ahara is the single factor that sustains living beings in the category of two dhammas he mentioned mind and matter ignorance and craving for existence mindfulness and comprehensions tranquillity of mind and insight etc in three dhammas he mentioned the three roots of demeritoriousness the three roots of meritoriousness the three kinds of misconduct the three kinds of good conduct the three trainings the three kinds of development etc xiv introduction in the last category of ten dhammas he spoke of ten spheres of kasina ten kinds of action productive of unwhole some effects ten kinds of action productive of wholesome effects etc in the sangiti suttas the ten categories of dhammas beginning with single dhamma to ten dhammas all sum up to kinds of dhamma there is no other sutta where greater number of kinds of dhamma is enumerated the buddha called this sutta sangitipariyaya’ which the commentary defines as the discourse that provides for condition or cause for unanimity among the samghas with regard to dhammas xi dasuttara sutta this sutta also was taught by the venerable sariputta during his stay near the vagara lake at campa he made this discourse to the bhikkhus saying “bhikkhus shall discourse on dassuttara sutta that will release you from the bonds of defilements thereby leading to nibbana the end of dukkha in making this discourse as with the sangiti sutta the venerable sariputta presented the dhamma under ten groups such as the single dhammas two dhammas three dhammas and so on the difference here is that the teacher uses formula such as for instance in the single dhamma “one dhamma brings much benefit one dhamma should be developed one dhamma should be understood fully etc then he explains “which single dhamma brings much benefit not neglecting in doing good deeds is the single dhamma which brings much benefit in the two dhammas and the remaining groups of dhammas too the same formula is employed thus in two dhammas he expounds mindfulness and comprehension as the two dhammas which bring much benefit he further states that tranquillity of mind and insight are the two dhammas which should be developed introduction xv the commentary explains that this sutta is called dasuttara because it sets out to present some important dhammas from the buddha’s words in ten graduated groups from single dhamma to ten dhammas most of the dhammas described in the dasuttara sutta are found in sangiti sutta however there are certain dhammas that are found only in this sutta to name some of them in the sangiti sutta in the two dhamma group sankhata and asankhata vijj and vimutti are not found in the three dhammas of that sutta the three knowledges pertaining to the past the future and the present are not found in the four dhammas of that sutta the four sampatti cakkas and the four ariya truths are not found in the six dhammas the six abhififids are not found in the seven dhammas the seven khindsavabalas are not found in the eight dhammas the eight causes which are con ducive to attaining knowledge the eight ariya maggas and the eight thoughts of great man are not found further in the nine dhammas the nine dhammas which are based on yonisomanasikara or the right attitude of mind the nine dhammas which are based on craving and the nine kinds of perception are not found in the ten dhammas the ten perceptions and the ten causes of destruction are not found in the singiti sutta in

discourse concerning pathikaputta the naked ascetic the story of sunakkhatta thus have heard at one time the bhagava was staying at market town named anupiya in the country of the malla princes then in the morning the bhagava having rearranged his robes and taking his alms bowl and great robe set out for the market town of anupiya for alms food then this thought occurred to the bhagava ‘it is still too early to go round for alms food in the market town of anupiya it would be good if were to go to the monastic dwelling belonging to the wandering ascetic bhaggava of the bhaggava clan’ then the bhagava approached the monastic dwelling belonging to the wandering ascetic bhaggava of the bhaggava clan then the wandering ascetic bhaggava addressed the bhagava thus “may the bhagava please come venerable sir the com ing of the bhagava is good venerable sir it has taken long time for the bhagava to visit us here here is seat duly prepared may the bhagava take the seat then the bhagava took the prepared seat the wandering ascetic bhaggava took low seat and sat at suitable place seated thus he said to the bhagava “venerable sir previously on some days sunakkhatta licchavi prince came

with ropes and have him dragged along by team of bullocks either the ropes would break off or the naked ascetic pathikaputta himself would be torn apart if the naked ascetic pathikaputta would not withdraw that word would not abandon that thought would not give up that view he should not come and face me should this thought occur to him ‘without withdrawing that word without abandon ing that thought without giving up that view would go and face samana gotama his head would break asunder and fall off friend pathikaputta do come just by your coming we will make you the winner and samana gotama the loser when this was said bhaggava the naked ascetic pathikaputta said “friend am coming friend am coming’ but he only wriggled and was unable to rise up from his seat then bhaggava jaliya the disciple of darupattika said to the naked ascetic pathikaputta “friend pathikaputta are your buttocks stuck to the seat or else is the seat stuck to your buttocks saying ‘friend am coming friend am coming’ you just wriggled and were unable to rise up from the seat bhaggava in spite of being told thus the naked ascetic pathikaputta merely said ‘friend am coming friend am coming’ but he only wriggled and was unable to rise up from his seat pathika sutta bhaggava when jaliya the disciple of darupattika knew that the naked ascetic pathikaputta could only say ‘friend lam coming friend am coming’ but only wriggled and was unable to rise up from his seat and that he was likely to lose in the contest he said these words to pathikaputta ‘friend pathikaputta what happened in the past was that the lion king of the beasts had this thought “it would be good if were to make my home base in jungle thicket come out from this base in the evening stretch my limbs and roam about surveying the four quarters make three brave roars after making the three brave roars go out in search of food after killing the finest animals and eating the choicest tenderest meat return to my home base then friend that lion king of beasts made his home base in the jungle thicket came out from that base in the evening stretched its limbs and roamed about surveying the four quarters went out in search of food after making three brave roars after killing the finest animals and eating the choicest tenderest meat returned to the home base friend pathikaputta there was an old fox who had grown fat and strong living on the remains of the food of that lion king of the beasts then this thought occurred to that old fox ‘who am and who is the lion the king of beasts it would be good if also were to make my home base in jungle thicket come out from that base in the evening stretch my limbs and roam about surveying the four quarters make three brave roars after surveying the four quarters go in search of food after making the three brave roars after killing the finest animals and eating the choicest tenderest meat return to my home base’ then friend that old fox made his home base in jungle thicket came out from that base in the evening stretched its limbs and roamed about surveying the four quarters at tempted to make three brave roars after surveying the four quarters but only produced the barks of fox only very unpleasant sound who is the wretched fox what is the lion’s roar to him meaning the wretched fox has nothing to do with lion’s roar pathika vagga in the same way my friend pathikaputta while you exist by depending on the three fold training of the buddha’s teach ing and by partaking of the leftovers of the food served to the buddha” you imagine you can insult the tathagata who is worthy of special veneration and who truly comprehends all the dhammas by his own intellect and insight who are you wretched pathikaputta to insult the tathagata who is worthy of special veneration and who truly comprehends all the dhammas by his own intellect and insight bhaggava when jaliya the disciple of darupattika could not make the naked ascetic pathikaputta move from that seat by this parable he said to him thus “the fox imagined itself to be not just lion but to be the king of the beasts although it imagined itself thus it could only bark like fox as it used to do in its young days who is the wretched fox what is the lion’s roar to him in the same way my friend pathikaputta while you exist by depending on the threefold training of the buddha’s teaching and by partaking of the leftovers of the food served to the buddha and his disciples you imagine you can insult the tathagata who is worthy of special veneration and who truly comprehends all the dhammas by his own intellect and insight who are you wretched pathikaputta to insult the tathagata who is worthy of special veneration and who truly comprehends all the dhammas by his own intellect and insight the commentary says that the people support the naked ascetic pathikaputta with the four requisites in the belief that he is buddha the enlightened one who is accomplished in the threefold training of sila samadhi and pafifia pathikaputta in fact was not buddha but since he lives on the requisites offered to him in the belief that he was accomplished in the threefold training of the buddha teaching he was said to exist by depending on the three fold training of the buddha’s teaching actually what is meant here is the food left over after making offerings to the buddha and his disciples people give away such food to the naked ascetics who go round for food in the evenings the commen tary pathikaputta’s saying that he would compete with the buddha in showing feats of supernormal psychic power is an insult to the buddha pathika sutta bhaggava when jaliya the disciple of darupattika could not make the naked ascetic pathikaputta move from that seat by this parable he said to him thus “the fox mere follower imagined itself to be lion so long as it did not see the reflection of its true self in the water although it imagined itself thus it just barked like fox as it was used to in its young days who is the wretched fox what is the lion’s roar in the same way my friend pathikaputta while you exist by depending on the three trainings of the buddha’s teaching and by partaking of the leftovers of the food served to the buddha you imagine you can insult the bhagava who is worthy of special veneration and who truly comprehends all the dhammas by his own intellect and insight who are you wretched pathikaputta to insult to the bhagava who is worthy of special veneration and truly comprehends all the dhammas by his own intellect and insight bhaggava when jaliya the disciple of darupattika could not make the naked ascetic pathikaputta move from that seat by this parable also he said to him thus “living on frogs field rats and decomposed corpses discarded in cemetries the fox who had grown up in the wilderness of great forest imagines itself to be lion although it imagined itself thus it just barked like fox as it used to do in its young days who is the wretched fox what is the lion’s roar in the same way my friend pathikaputta while you exist by depending on the threefold training of the buddha’s teaching and by partaking of the leftovers of the food served to the buddha you imagine you can insult the bhagava who is worthy of special veneration and who truly comprehends all the dhammas by his own intellect and insight who are you wretched pathikaputta to insult the bhagava who is worthy of special veneration and who comprehends all dhammas by his own intellect and insight pathika vagga bhaggava when jaliya the disciple of darupattika could not make the naked ascetic pathikaputta move from that seat by this parable also he returned to the crowd and told them thus ‘friends the naked ascetic pathikaputta said ‘friend am coming friend am coming’ but he only wriggled and was unable to rise up from his seat he is likely to lose in the contest’ when this was said bhaggava told the crowd thus ‘if the naked ascetic pathikaputta would not withdraw that word would not abandon that thought would not give up that view he should not come to my presence should this thought occur to him “without withdrawing that word with out abandoning that thought without giving up that view would go and face samana gotama his head would break asunder and fall off and should this thought occur to you friend licchavis ‘we will tie up the naked ascetic pathikaputta with ropes and have him dragged along by elephants either the ropes would break off or the naked ascetic pathikaputta would be torn apart if the naked ascetic pathikaputta would not withdraw that word would not abandon that thought would not give up that view he should not come and face me should this thought occur to him ‘without withdrawing that word without abandoning that thought without giving up that view will go and face samana gotama his head would break asunder and fall off then bhaggava with talk on the dhamma showed the assembly the benefits of the dhamma exhorted them to practise the dhamma filled them with enthusiasm for the practice of the dhamma and gladdened them in the dhamma after thus showing them the benefits of dhamma after exhorting them to practise the dhamma after filling them with enthusiasm for the practice of the dhamma after glad dening them in the dhamma with talk on the dhamma and having freed eighty four thousand sentient beings from the vari ous bonds of kilesa and having taken them out of the difficult journey of the four oghas whirlpools entered into the mental absorption of tejo dhatu the fourth jhana pathika sutta rose to height seven times the length of palm tree further creating flames blazing with smoke and rose to height of seven times the length of palm tree and returned to and stayed at the pinnacled monastery in mahavanna the great forest then bhaggava sunakkhatta the licchavi prince approached me and after paying homage to me sat at suitable place bhagava to sunakkhatta the licchavi prince who was thus seated said thus ‘sunakkhatta what do you think of this concerning what had told you about the naked ascetic pathikaputta did the events prove my words to be true or otherwise “venerable sir concerning what the bhagava had told me about the naked ascetic pathikaputta the events had proved your words to be true and not otherwise “sunakkhatta what do you think of this such being the case does it or does it not amount to showing the supernormal feats of psychic power which transcends the dhamma practised by ordinary human beings “venerable sir such being the case if amounts to showing the supernormal psychic powers which transcend the dhamma practised by ordinary human be ings it does not amount to not showing them ‘you empty man to me who showed in this manner the supernormal feats of psychic power which transcend the dhamma practised by ordinary human beings you said ‘venerable sir the bhagava has not shown me the supernormal psychic powers which transcend the dhamma practised by ordinary human be ings you empty man look at this offence that you have done bhagava although spoke to him thus sunakkhatta the licchavi prince departed from this teaching in the manner of one doomed to suffer in niraya in the apaya doctrine concerning the beginning of the world bhagava know the doctrine concerning the begin ning of the world know it and also know the dhamma pathika vagga which surpasses it although know thus do not view these dhammas in the wrong way since do not view these dhammas in the wrong way realize by myself the extinction of defile ments kilesas in me the tathagata who thus knows does not meet with distress bhaggava there are samanas and brahmanas teach ing the doctrine concerning the beginning of the world as traditionally handed down to them by their teachers who be lieved that the world was created by supreme power or brahma approached them and asked them ‘friends is it true that you teach the doctrine concerning the beginning of the world as traditionally handed down to you by your teachers who believed that the world was created by supreme power or brahma when asked them thus they said it was true then asked them ‘in what manner by what arrangement or system do you teach the doctrine concerning the beginning of the world as traditionally handed down to you by your teachers who believed that the world was created by supreme power or brahma they could not answer my question they only asked me back and replied to them thus there indeed is such time friends as when this world system gets dissolved as it does at times after lapse of many aeons when the world system becomes thus dissolved beings are reborn mostly in the abhassara plane of existence of radiant brahmas when they are born there because of jhana mind they are nurtured by rapture piti resplendant with light from their own bodies sojourning in the heavens and living in splendour and they remain there for aeons there indeed is such time friends as when the world system rises again as it does at times after lapse of many aeons when the world system thus rises again there appears palatial brahma abode brahma vimana void of all life at that time certain being from the abhassara plane of existence dies abhassara see appexdix to brahmayjala sutta silakkhanda vagga pathika sutta either at the end of his span of life or on the exhaustion of the stock of his meritorious deeds and is reborn in that empty palatial brahma realm when he is born there because of jhana mind he is nurtured by rapture resplendant with light from his own body sojourning in the heavens and living in splendour thus he remains there for aeons living there alone for aeons there arises in him mental weariness and longing for company thus “would that some other beings come to this place’ and then other beings from the abhassara plane of existence die either at the end of their span of life or on the exhaustion of the stock of their meritorious deeds and are reborn in that palatial brahma abode as compan ions of that being the first one when they are born there because of jhana mind they are nurtured by rapture resplendant with light from their bodies sojourning in the heavens and living in splendour thus they remain there for aeons then friends this thought occurred to the being who was the first to be reborn there “i am the brahma the great brahma the conqueror the unconquered the all seeing the subjector of all to his wishes the omnipotent the maker the creator the supreme the one who assigns each to his own station the one confirmed in the practice of jhana the father of all that have been and shall be have created these other beings why is it so can say so because in the past thought to myself “would that some other being come to this place as wished so other beings have appeared in this place this thought also occurred to other beings who appeared later “this honorable person is the brahma the great brahma the conqueror the unconquered the all seeing the subjector of all to his wishes the omnipotent the maker the creator the supreme the one who assigns each to his own station the one confirmed in the practice of jhana and the father of all that have been and shall be this honorable brahma has created us why is it so we can say so because as we see he appeared in this place first whereas we appeared only after him pathika vagga among them friends the one who appeared first lives longer and is more beautiful and more powerful than the others those beings who appeared later have shorter life and are less beautiful and less powerful than the one who first appeared then friends there arises this possibility certain being dies in the brahma plane of existence and is reborn in this human world and there he renounces the worldly hfe for the homeless life of recluse and having thus renounced the worldly life and become homeless recluse he achieves mental concentration by dint of ardent steadfast persevering exertion mindfulness and right attentiveness having established his mind in concentration he can recollect that former existence of brahma but he cannot recollect beyond that he says thus “that honorable person is the brahma the great brahma the conqueror the unconquered the all seeing the subjector of all to his wishes the omnipotent the maker the creator the supreme the one who assigns each to his own station the one confirmed in the practice of jhana and father to all that have been and shall be that honorable brahma has created us he is permanent stable eternal immutable and as everlasting as all things

about it just as the revered gotama has told us’ bhaggava know the doctrine concerning the beginning of the world know it and also know the dhamma which surpasses it although know thus do not view these dhammas in the wrong way since do not view these dhamma in the wrong way realize by myself the extinction of defilements kilesas in me the tathagata who thus knows does not meet with distress

of the world as traditionally handed down to you by your teacher who believed that the world first began with khiddapadosika deva they could not answer my question they only asked me back and replied to them thus friends there are devas known as khiddapad sikas who absorbed in merry making and pleasure seeking for long time forget to take nutriment and through such forgetfulness die in that abode of the devas then friends there arises this possibility certain being dies in that world of devas and is reborn in this human world and there he renounces the worldly life for the homeless life of

plea sure seeking for long time we forget to take nutriment through such forgetfulness we die in that world of the devas pathika vagga we are impermanent unstable short lived and mortal thus we have come into this human world’ friends did you teach in this manner the doctrine con cerning the beginning of the world as traditionally handed down to you by your teachers who believed that the world first began with khiddapadosika devas they said thus ‘friend gotama we have heard about it just as the revered gotama has told us’ bhaggava know the doctrine concerning the beginning of the world know

only asked me back and replied to them thus friends there are devas known as manopadosikas who stare hard and long at one another with jealousy staring hard and long thus at one another they develop mutual hatred becoming exhausted both physically and mentally they die in that world of devas then friends there arises this possibility certain being dies in that world of devas and is reborn in the

brahmas who are known as asafifiasatta beings devoid of saffia lit perception here the commentary says mind and mental concomitants are meant they pass away from the brehma world by the arising of

dhammas in the wrong way since do not view these dhammas in this way realize by myself the extinction of defilements kilesas in me the tathagata who thus knows does not meet with distress bhaggava some samanas and brahmanas have falsely accused me as one who used to say and teach in this manner only with words that are groundless stupid untrue and inaccu rate thus “samana gotama is erratic his bhikkhu disciples are also erratic samana gotama teaches that ‘when one is absorbed in the jhana of subha vimokkha all things pleasant as well as unpleasant objects are perceived as unpleasant bhaggava have never thought that ‘when one is absorbed in the jhana of subha vimokkha all things pleasant as well as unpleasant objects are perceived as unpleasant’ only teach ‘when one is absorbed in the jhana of subha vimokkha the pleasant is perceived as pleasant’ pathika sutta venerable sir those people accuse the bhagava and his bhikkhu disciples as being erratic but in fact only they are erratic venerable sir am devoted to the bhagava in such manner ‘the bhagava will be able to teach me the dhamma so that may attain and abide in the jhana of subha vimokkha bhaggava it is hard for you holding different view belonging to different faith having different inclination in belief pursuing different practice and following teacher of another school of doctrine to attain and abide in the jhana of subha vimokkha bhaggava exhort you to keep on just maintaining well your devotion to me venerable sir if it is hard for me holding different view belonging to different faith having different inclination in belief pursuing different practice and following teacher of another school of doctrine to attain and abide in the jhana of subha vimokkha will keep on just maintaining well my pious devotion and faith in the bhagava thus spoke the bhagava delighted the wandering as cetic bhaggava of the bhaggava clan rejoiced in the words of the bhagava end of pathika sutta the first sutta subha vimokkha means release from defilements through attainment of jhdna by contemplation of brightness and clarity of colors such as dark blue yellow red or white namo tassa bhagavato arahato sammasambuddhassa ii udumbarika sutta il udumbarika sutta discourse at udumbarika’s monastic dwelling the story of nigrodha the wandering ascetic at one time the bhagava was staying on the gijjhaktta hill near rajagaha at that time there was staying in queen udumbarika’s monastic dwelling nigrodha the wandering as cetic with company of followers numbering three thousand then one afternoon the householder sandhana set out from rajagaha to see the bhagava but on the way he thought thus “it is not the time yet to see the bhagava he is in solitary seclusion absorbed in jhana nor is it the time yet to call on the community of bhikkhus who are capable of inspiring devo tion and meritorious thoughts” they will also be in solitary seclusion absorbed in jhana it will be good if were to go to nigrodha the wandering ascetic in udumbarika’s monastic dwell ing” then the householder sandhana went to see the wandering ascetic nigrodha in queen udumbarika’s monastic dwelling at that time nigrodha the wandering ascetic was seated amidst his large company of followers who were all talking loudly vociferously and resoundingly on various unprof itable subjects contrary to and not conducive to moral conduct leading to the attainment of the deva world and nibbana such kinds of talk are talk about kings thieves ministers armed forces calami lies battles food drinks clothing beds flowers unguents relatives vehicles villages market towns cities provinces wom enfolk menfolk heroes streets waterfronts the dead and the the householder sandhana sandhana gahapati distinguished dis ciple of the buddha an anagami highly praised by the buddha himself for being firmly established in faith in the virtues of the buddha the dhamma and the samgha and being well accomplished in the practice with attainment of andgami magga and phala capable of inspiring devotion and meritorious thoughts manobhavaniya bhikkhus by virtue of their moral conduct and practice of pure life in solitude inspire devotion and meritorious thoughts in the lay people talk on unprofitable subjects tiricchanakatha pathika vagga departed and other useless talk the universe the oceans pros perity adversity and so on on seeing the householder sandhana coming in the distance nigrodha the wandering ascetic called his assembly to order saying “remain quiet sirs make no noise here comes the householder sandhana disciple of samana gotama the householder sandhana is one amongst the many white clad lay disciples of samana gotama living in rajagaha these worthy people appreciate silence they are well trained in the mainte nance of silence they admire quietness perhaps on seeing how quiet our assembly is he may think it worthwhile to come here on being addressed thus the company of the wandering ascetics remained silent then the householder sandhana approached nigrodha the wandering ascetic after exchanging courteous greetings and having said memorable words of felicitations he sat at suitable place thus seated the householder sandhana said to nigrodha the wandering ascetic “different from the bhagava in their conduct are these wandering ascetics of another view when they meet or congre gate they talk loudly vociferously and resoundingly on various unprofitable subjects contrary to and not conducive to moral conduct leading to the attainment of the deva world and nibbana such kinds of talk are talk about kings thieves prosper ity adversity and so on wnereas the bhagava being different from the wandering ascetics reside in remote secluded forest abodes where there is little noise and little soft babble which is free from human intrusions which is suitable for performing secret acts by human beings and suitable for solitary life when this was said nigrodha the wandering ascetic said to the householder sandhana “do you know householder and so on by this it means ‘forest mountains rivers and islands’ free from human intrusion vijanavatani the commentary renders it as ‘free from the noise of people moving about in the monastic com pound udumbarika sutta sandhana with whom samana gotama talks with whom does he hold discussions by debating with whom does he attain distinction in wisdom samana gotama’s wisdom has disap peared in secluded place by living solitary life samana gotama lacks confidence to face crowd he is unskilled as public speaker he dwells only in remote secluded forest abodes just as blind cow stays and grazes on the outer edge of the herd so also samana gotama dwells only in remote secluded forest abode and thus his wisdom has disappeared samana gotama lacks confidence to face crowd he is unskilled as public speaker he dwells only in remote secluded forest abodes indeed householder if samana gotama were to come to this gathering we could subdue him with single question we could bind him and turn him round like an empty pot then the bhagava with his divine power of hearing which is extremely clear surpassing the hearing power of men heard this conversation between nigrodha the wandering ascetic and the householder sandhana and descending from gijjhakita hill the bhagava came to the feeding ground of the peacocks on the banks of sumagadha lake and there he was walking up and down on the wide stretch of jand when nigrodha the wander ing ascetic saw the bhagava walking up and down on the wide stretch of land which serves as the feeding ground of the peacocks on the banks of sumagadha lake he called his assembly to order saying ‘remain quiet sirs make no noise samana gotama is walking up and down on the wide stretch of land which serves as the feeding ground of the peacocks on the banks of sumagadha lake this venerable one appreciates silence he admires quietness perhaps on seeing how quiet our assembly is he may think it worthwhile to come here if samana gotama comes to this assembly we might ask him this question “venerable sir what is this dhamma which you teach your disciples and with which you have trained them so that they attain the ancient ariya magga the noble support and acknowledge such attainment with delight when he had said thus those wandering ascetics re mained silent pathika vagga tapojiguccha vada then the bhagava went to nigrodha the wandering ascetic then nigrodha the wandering ascetic said to the bhagava thus “be pleased to come venerable sir your coming is good venerable sir it has taken long time for the bhagava to visit us may it please the bhagava to take seat here is seat duly prepared’ then the bhagava sat on the prepared seat nigrodha the wandering ascetic took low seat and sat at suitable place when he was thus seated the bhagava said to him ‘nigrodha what were you talking about as you were sitting down here together what was the subject of your conversation before came when this was said nigrodha the wandering ascetic made this reply “venerable sir on seeing the bhagava pacing up and down the wide stretch of land which serves as the feeding ground of the peacocks on the banks of sumagadha lake had said ‘if samana gotama comes to this assembly we might ask this question “venerable sir what is this dhamma which you teach your disciples and with which you have trained them so that they attain the ancient ariya magga the noble support and acknowledge such attainment with delight “venerable sir this was our unfinished conversation be fore the bhagava came here nigrodha it is hard for you holding different view belonging to different faith having different inclination in belief pursuing different practice and following teacher of another school of doctrine to understand the dhamma which have taught my disciples and with which have trained them so that they attain the ancient ariya magga the noble support and acknowledge such attainment with delight come now nigrodha you ask me instead questions on adhijeguccha prac tice of extreme austerity in order to avoid detestable wrong doing which is the doctrine of your own teachers you should ask ‘venerable sir how does tapojuguccha the practice of udumbarika sutta extreme self mortification in order to avoid detestable wrong doing become perfect how does it become imperfect when the bhagava had said thus the wandering ascetic acclaimed loudly vociferously and astoundingly ‘o friends how wonderful how marvellous are the great might and powers of samana gotama he sets aside his own doctrine and invites discussion on the doctrine of others’ then nigrodha the wandering ascetic bade those wandering ascetics to remain quiet and addressed the bhagava in those words venerable sir by word of mouth we profess tapoyjiguccha the practice of extreme self mortification in order to avoid detestable wrong doing we hold tapojiguccha to be the essence and we practise tapojiguccha constantly and stead fastly venerable sir how does the practice of tapojiguccha become perfect how does it become imperfect in this world nigrodha an ascetic who practises self

imperfect udumbarika sutta nigrodha say that although you say that this practice of tapojiguccha is perfect there are many and varied defile ments it defilement of the mind venerable sir how does the bhagava say that there are many and varied defilements in this perfect practice of tapojiguccha in this world nigrodha an ascetic engages himself in the practice of austerity being thus engaged he is delighted his intentions have been fulfilled nigrodha an ascetic engages himself in such practice of austerity being thus engaged he is delighted his intentions have been fulfilled nigrodha such delight and sense of fulfilment itself is defilement in the ascetic and again nogrodha an ascetic engages himself in the practice of austerity being thus engaged he extols himself and disparages others nigrodha an ascetic engages himself in such practice of austerity being thus engaged he extols himself and disparages others nigrodha such extolling himself and dispar aging others itself is defilement in the ascetic and again nigrodha an ascetic engages himself in the practice of austerity being thus engaged he becomes intoxicated with conceit bewilderment and unmindfulness nogrodha an

bewilderment and unmindfulness nigrodha such intoxication with conceit bewilderment and unmindfulness through acquisition of material benefits honour and fame itself is defilement in the ascetic and then again nigrodha an ascetic makes distinc tions as regards food saying ‘this is what like this is what don’t like’ he rejects what he dislikes even though he has craving for it what he likes he eats greedily with unmindfulness with strong attachment without seeing the fault without knowl edge nigrodha such eating with greed etc itself is defilement in the ascetic and again nigrodha an ascetic engages himself in the practice of austerity with longing for material benefits honour and fame hoping that kings ministers members of the ruling class brahmins householders and leaders of religious sects will pay him respect nigrodha such longing for material benefits etc itself is defilement in the ascetic and again nigrodha an ascetic disparages certain samana or brahmana accusing him thus “he lives on various things ”’ what are such things they are root germs stem germs udumbarika sutta node germs plumule germs and seed germs what is the use of calling such person with

not like it he would reply ‘no don’t though he likes it’ in this way he tells deliberate lies nigrodha such telling deliberate lies itself is defilement in the ascetic and again nigrodha when the tathagata or his disciples teach the dhamma an ascetic would not acknowledge what is the truth and what ought to be acknowledged as the truth nigrodha such failure to acknowledge what ought to be acknowledged itself is defilement in the ascetic and again nigrodha an ascetic harbours anger and grudge nigrodha an ascetic has such harbouring of anger and grudge nigrodha such harbouring of anger kodha and grudge upanaha itself is defilement in the ascetic pathika vagga and again nigrodha an ascetic denigrates others makkha and is given to improper rivalry palasa is given to envy issa and

these ascetic practices are indeed impure and not pure venerable sir there is the possibility that an ascetic is possessed of all these impurities not to say of anyone of them ‘purity comparable to the outer crust of tree’ in this world nigrodha an ascetic engages himself in the practice of austerity being thus engaged he is not delighted his intentions have not been fulfilled nigrodha an

such being the case is the ascetic practice pure or impure such being the case venerable sir the ascetic practice is indeed pure and not impure it has reached the apex the heartwood in this way nigrodha it has reached the apex reached the heartwood nigrodha you have said to me ‘vener able sir what is this dhamma which you teach your disciples and with which you have trained them so that they attain the ancient ariya magga the noble support and acknowledge such attainment with delight nigrodha this is the dhamma which teach my disciples and with which have trained them so that they attain the ancient ariya magga the noble support and acknowledge such attainment with delight and this dhamma of which you have asked me is higher and more pleasing than the ascetic practice when the bhagava had said thus the wandering ascetic cried loudly and vociferously “we together with our teachers are lost we know nothing of this dhamma which is higher and more pleasing than psychic power of divine sight concentration and insight vodaniya dhamma which the commentary explains to be the practice of concentration and insight meditation pathika vagga crestfallen nigrodha when the householder sandhana knows that these wandering ascetics of different views are now indeed in mood to listen to the words of the bhagava and have become attentive and desirous of hearing the dhamma he said to nigrodha the wandering ascetic “wenerable nigrodha you had said these words to me ‘householder do you know with whom samana gotama talks with whom does he hold discussions by debat ing with whom does he attain distinction in wisdom samana gotama’s wisdom has disappeared in secluded place by living solitary life samana gotama lacks confidence to face crowd he is unskilled as public speaker he dwells only in remote places just as blind cow grazes on the outer edge of the herd and stays in remote places so also samana gotama’s wisdom has disappeared by living in secluded place samana gotama lacks confidence to face crowd he is unskilled as public speaker he dwells only in remote places indeed householder if samana gotama were to come to this gathering we could subdue him with single question we could bind him and turn him round like an empty pot’ now venerable one the homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened the exalted one has arrived here prove that he lacks confidence to face crowd prove that he is like blind cow grazing on the outer edge of the herd subdue him now with single question bind him and turn him round like an empty pot when this was said nigrodha the wandering ascetic sat silent confused with droop ing shoulders and bent head downcast and incapable of making an answer then the bhagava realising that nigrodha the wan dering ascetic sat silent confused with drooping shoulders and bent head downcast and incapable of making an answer said to him “nigrodha is it true that you had said so “it is true venerable sir that had said so being foolish bewildered and unwise” ‘“nigrodha what do you think of this have you ever heard it said by the aged elderly wandering ascetics who are your teachers or teachers of your teachers thus “the udumbarika sutta homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened ones who had appeared in the past used to engage themselves when they met and congregated in conversations loudly vociferously and re soundingly like you all with your teachers do now talking about kings about thieves prosperity adversity and on various unprofitable subjects contrary to and not conducive to moral conduct leading to the attainment of magga phala or have you heard them say thus ‘those exalted ones like me now used to reside in remote secluded forest abodes where there is little noise and little soft babble which is from human intrusions which is suitable for performing secret acts by human beings and which is suitable for solitary life “venerable sir have heard it said by the aged elderly wandering ascetics who are my teachers or teachers of my teachers thus “the homage worthy the perfectly self enlight ened ones who had appeared in the past did not engage themselves when they met and congregated in conversations loudly vociferously and resoundingly like me and my teacher do now talking about kings about thieves prosperity adversity and so on unprofitable subjects contrary to the attain ment of magga phala have heard them say ‘those exalted ones like the bhagava now used to reside in remote secluded forest abodes where there is little noise and little soft babble which is from human intrusions and which is suitable for performing secret acts by human beings and which is suitable for solitary life nigrodha even though you are learned and elderly this thought has not occurred to you “the bhagava having himself truly and clearly comprehended the four ariya truths and teaches others to let them know the four ariya truths the bhagava having himself well tamed teaches others so as to tame them the bhagava having calmed himself teaches others so as to make them calm the bhagava having himself crossed over to the other shore he teaches others so as to help them cross over the bhagava having himself extinguished all the defilements kilesas teaches others to extinguish all the defilements” pathika vagga realizing the ultimate goal of the noble practice when this was said nigrodha the wandering ascetic addressed the bhagava thus venerable sir being foolish bewil dered and unwise was overwhelmed by misdeed in saying thus about the bhagava venerable sir request the bhagava to accept this admission of my guilt so that can restrain myself from committing such misdeed in the future nigrodha true indeed that being foolish bewildered and unwise you were overwhelmed by misdeed in saying thus about me nigrodha but now as you have realized your guilt and admitted it to make amends we accept your admission nigrodha realizing one’s guilt making amends and abstaining from such misdeed in the future means enhancement according to the injunctions of the ariyas nigrodha indeed say this ‘let man of wisdom who is not crafty not deceitful who is straightforward come to me shall instruct him shall teach him the dhamma’ by practising for seven years as instructed he will realizing by himself in this very life through magga insight abhififia attain and abide in the fruit of the noblest and supreme arahatship which is the ultimate goal of the noble practice and for which worthy men rightly renounce hearth and home for the homeless life of bhikkhu nigrodha let alone seven

renounce hearth and home for the homeless life of bhikkhu for five years for four years for three years for two years for one year nigrodha let alone one year let man of wisdom who is not crafty who is not deceitful who is straightforward come udumbarika sutta to me shall instruct him shall teach him the dhamma by practising for seven months as instructed he will realizing by himself in this very

through magga insight attain and abide in the fruit of the noblest and supreme arahatship which is the ultimate goal of the noble practice and for which worthy men rightly renounce hearth and home for the homeless life of bhikkhu crestfallen wandering ascetics nigrodha maybe this thought occurs to you some times samana gotama invites us to come to him in this way out of desire to make us his pupils nigrodha you should not take it in this way let only your teacher be still your teacher nigrodha maybe this thought also occurs to you occasionally too samana gotama invites us to come to him in this way out of desire to distract us from reciting or learning our scriptures you should not thus construe my invitation let that which is your scriptures be still your scriptures or maybe this thought occurs to you samana gotama invites us to come to him in this way out of desire to take us away from our mode of living nigrodha you should not take it in this way let only your mode of living be still your mode of living again maybe this thought also occurs to you occasionally “samana gotama invites us to come to him in this way out of desire to see us with our teacher remaining with dhammas which are demeritorious or pathika vagga which we regard to be demeritorious’ nigrodha you should not take it in this way let such dhammas which are demeritorious or which you and your teachers regard to be demeritorious be as they are maybe nigrodha this thought also occurs to you sometimes samana gotama invites us to come to him in this way out of desire to see us together with our teacher detached from such dhammas that are meritorious or which are regarded as meritorious nigrodha you should not take it in this way let such dhammas that are meritorious or which you and your teachers regard as meritorious be as they are nigrodha say these words not because wish to make you my pupils say these words not because wish to distract you from your scriptures say these words not because wish to take you away from your mode of living say these words not because want to see you with your teacher remaining with dhammas which are demeritorious or which you regard as demeritorious say these words not because want to see you detached from dhammas which are meritorious or which you regard to be meritorious nigrodha as matter of fact these are the demeritorious dhammas which are not yet abandoned which are objects of defilements not yet abandoned and which give rise to new existence which is accompanied by sorrow which lead to suffering and which give rise to birth ageing and death it is for the abandoning of these akusala dhammas that teach in you who practise as instructed the dhammas which are objects of defilement will be eradicated the dhammas which are condu cive to purification will develop you will realizing by yourself through magga insight in this very life attain and abide in full accomplishment of knowledge magga paffia and in full devel opment of fruition knowledge plala panna when this was said the wandering ascetics sat silent crestfallen with slumped shoulders and bent back confused and dumb founded like those whose hearts have been taken over by mara udumbarika sutta then this thought occurred to the bhagava ‘all these empty men have been oppressed by the evil one mara this thought does not occur to even one of them “come just to know let us go and take up the noble practice under samana gotama what does period of seven days matter then the bhagava having made these bold utterances destroying the wrong doctrines of others and establishing his own right view in queen udumbarika’s monastic dwelling for the wandering ascetics traversed through the air and alighted on gijjhakuta hill and the householder sandana made his way to rajagaha end of udumbarika sutta the second sutta namo tassa bhagavato arahato sammasambuddhassa ilj cakkavatti sutta if cakkavatti sutta being one’s own firm support being one’s own refuge thus have heard at one time the bhagav was staying at the town of matula in the country of magadha then the bhagavad addressed the bhikkhus as ‘bhikkhus’ and they replied pape ‘venerable sir’ and the bhagavad spoke as ollows be your own firm support lit island bhikkhus be your own fefuge do not take any other refuge let the dhamma be your firm support let the dhamma be your refuge do not take any other refuge and how bhikkhus does bhikkhu take himself as his own firm support as his own refuge and not any other refuge how does he take the dhamma as his firm support and his refuge and not any other refuge bhikkhus the bhikkhu the disciple following the practice of my teaching keeps his mind steadfastly on the body kdya with diligence comprehension and mindfulness and perceives its imperamnent insecure soulless and unpleasant nature thus keeping away covet ousness and distress which will appear if he is not mindful of the five khandhas the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on sensation vedund and perceives its impermanent insecure and soulless nature the bhikkhu concentrates steadfastly on the mind citta and perceives ts impermanent insecure and soulless nature the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the dhamma with diligence comprehension and mindfulness and perceives its impsrmanent insecure and soulless nature thus keeping away covetousmess and distress which will appear if he is not mindful of the five khandhas pathika vagga in this way bhikkhus bhikkhu takes himself as his own firm support himself as refuge and not any other refuge and he takes the dhamma as his firm support and his refuge not any other refuge keep yourselves bhikkhus within your own range of contemplation as has been taught and instructed by the buddha lit the father bhikkhus if you keep yourselves within the range of contemplation as has been taught and instructed by the buddha evil such as moral detfilements will have no opportunity no ground to arise in you bhikkhus it is by cultivation of wholesome dhammas that meritorious results accrue and develop dalhanemi the universal monarch bhikkhus this happened long time ago at that time there was universal monarch named dalhanemi king by right who ruled ina righteous manner over the four continents bounded by the four oceans the conqueror of all foes the promoter of peace and stability in his territories the possessor of seven precious treasures he possessed these seven precious treasures namely the wheel treasure the elephant treasure the horse treasure the gem treasure the queen treasure the rich man treasure and seventhly the eldest son treasure the king had more than thousand sons all brave men of heroic features able to conquer hosts of enemies he ruled over the earth to the extent of its ocean boundaries having conquered territories aot by force or by arms but by righteousness bhikkhus aftera lapse of many years many hun dreds of years many thousands of years king dalhanemi instructed certain man saying ‘o man if you should see this mighty wheel treasure make the slightest shift from its resting place slipping down little uring me word ‘very well your majesty replied the man range gocara lit pasture resort range here range of con templation means objects of steadfast mindfulness the bhikkhus ate exhorted to keep their minds occupied with these four stead fact mindfininess cakkavatti satta bhikkhus after lapse of many years many hiuii dreds of years many thousands of years the man saw the mighty wheel treasure make slight shift from its resting place slipping down little on seeing that the man went to king dalhanemi and said ‘may it please your majesty to know for atruth that the mighty wheel treasure had made atte shift from its resting place slipping dowa little upon this bhikkhus king dalhanemi sent for his eldest son and said to him ‘dear son my mighty wheel treasure has made slight shift from its resting place slipping down little have heard it said thus “should the mighty wheel treasure of universal monarch make slight shift from its rest ing place slipping down little the king has not much longer to live ‘i have had my full share of human pleasures it is time now for me to seek celestial bliss come my dear son take over charge of ruling the earth bounded by the ocean as for me shaving off my hair and beard and putting on the bark dyed robes shall go forth from the household life into the homeless life of an ascetic then bhikkhus king dalhanemi after giving his son full instructions on kingship shaved off his hair and beard put on the bark dyed robes and went forth from the household life into the home less life of an ascetic on the seventh day after the royal ascetic had gone forth the mighty wheel treasure disappeared then certain man went to the anointed king of the khattiya caste and said to him ‘may it please you majesty to know fora truth that the mighty wheel trea sure has disappeared thereupon the anointed king of the khattiya caste was stricken with grief over the disappearance of the mighiy wheel treasure and showed great distress and he went to the royal ascetic and reported to him ‘know for truth your majesty that the mighty wheel trea has disappeared then bhikkhus the royal ascetic said to the anointed king of the khattiya caste ‘grieve not my dear son show no distress over the disappear ance of the mighty wheel treasure the mighty wheel treasure is not paternal heritage of yours come now dea son fulfil the noble duties re quired of universal monarch on sabbath day the fifteenth day of the month perform the ceremonial ablution of your head then ascend to the upper most terrace of your palace’ and observe the moral precepts in fulfilment of the noble duties required of universal monarch there is reason to believe

not see any power as hard to conquer as that of mara the only power that can subdue this force of madara is the power of the arahattaphala bhikkhus it is by cultivation of wholesome dhammas that meritorious results thus accrue and develop thus spoke the bhagava and the bhikkhus glad at heart rejoiced at the words of the bhagavad end of cakkavatti sutta tue third sutta namo tassa bhagavato arahato sammdasambuddhassa iv agpafina sutta iv agganna sutta vasettha and bharadvaja thus have heard at one ume the bhagava was staying at pubbarama the pinnacled monastery built by migdramata visakha in sdvatthi vasettha and bharadvaja aspiring to become full members of the order were staying with the bhikkhus then in the evening the bhagava having arisen from solitary meditation came down from the pinnacled monastery and was walking up and down in the open space under the shade of the monastery then vasettha saw the bhagava who having arisen from solitary meditation had come down from the pinnacled monastery and was walking up and down in the open space under the shade of the monastery having thus seen the bhagava he said to bharadvaja ‘friend bharadvaja the bhagava having risen from solitary meditation has come down from the pinnacled monastery and is walking up and down in the open space under the shade of the monastery fricnd bharadvaja let us go to the bhagava we may perhaps get an opportunity to hear discourse from the bhagava ‘very well my friend’ replied bharadvaja to vasettha then vasettha and bharadvaja went to the bhagava having paid homage to the bhagava they followed him walking up and down then the bhagava said to vasettha “vasettha you who are brahmin by birth and of high class brahmin family have left the houschold life of the brahmin tamily for the homeless life of bhikkhu how is it do not the brahmins abuse you revile you “venerable sir indecd the brahmins did abuse us as they liked and to their heart content not sparingly” and how did the brahmins abuse you revile you most thoroughly as they like and to their heart content they were waiting to become twenty years of age which is the required age for full admission into the order of bhikkhus pathika vagga he replied “venerable sir they said thus ‘only the brahmin class is noble other classes are lowly only the brahmin class is fair other classes are dark only the brahmins are pure non brahmins are not only the brahmins are offspring of the brahma who are developed in his breast are born from his mouth descended from him created by him are heirs to the brahma “you have abandoned your own family of the highest class and joined the shaven headed lowly swarthy samanas born of the feet of the brahma and are associates of mara this course of action is not good “you have abandoned your own family of the highest class and joined the shaven headed lowly swarthy samanas born of the feet of the brahma and are associates of mara this course of action not proper ‘venerable sir in this manner the brahmins have abused us reviled us most thoroughly as they liked and to their heart content not sparingly’ vasettha as matter of fact only because the brahmins do not know the process of development of social classes in the past that they say thus ‘only the brahmin class is noble other classes are lowly only the brahmin class is fair other classes are dark only the brahmins are pure non brahmins are not only the brahmins are offspring of the brahma who are developed in his breast are born trom his mouth descended from him created by him and are heirs to him’ vasettha it is common knowledge® that the wives of the brahmins having menstrual discharges are apparent also their becoming pregnant are apparent also their bearing children and nursing them are pure sujjhanu pure with respect to breed not open to attack with reyard to one’s birth offspring of the brahma according to the commentary that is reference to the brahmins who hold that all beings are descended from the great brahma by him are heirs to the brahma it is commom knowledge dissanti literally are seen perceived apparent aggafifia sutta apparent these brahmins although born from the female organs of generation are saying “only the brahmin class is noble other classes are lowly only the brahmin class is fair other classes wre dark only the brahmins are pure non brahmins are not only the brahmins are offspring of the brahma who are devel oped in his breast are born from his mouth descended from him created by him and heirs to him they are slandering the brahmin also telling lics and also bringing forth much demerit for themselves purity of the four social classes now vasettha there are four social classes the ruling class the brahmins the traders and the working class in this world vasettha certain member of the ruling class takes lite of beings takes what is not given indulges in sexual misconduct tells lies speaks malicious words uses harsh words and indulges in frivolous talk is covetous is full of ill will holds wrong views thus vasettha there are these dhammas which are demeritorious and are regarded as demeritorious which are blameworthy and are regarded as blameworthy which are to be resorted to and are regarded as not to be resorted to which are not capable of making one an ariya and are regarded as not capable of making one an ariya which defile the mind and which result in evil and are reproached by the wise in this world vasettha these dhammas are also found in some members of the ruling class in this world vasettha certain member of the brahmin class in this world vasettha certain member of the trading class in this world vasettha certain member of the working class takes the life of beings takes what is not given indulges in sexual misconduct tells lics speaks malicious words uses harsh words indulges in irivolous talk thus vasettha there are these dhammas which are demeritorious and are re garded as demeritorious which defile the mind and which result in evil and are reproached by the wise in this world those dhammas are also found in some members of the working class pathika vagga in this world vasettha certain member of the ruling class abstains from taking the life of beings abstains from taking what is not given abstains from indulging in sexual misconduct abstains from telling hes abstains from speaking malicious words abstains from using harsh words and abstains from indulging in frivolous talk he is not covetous is free of ill will and holds the right view thus vasettha there are these dhammas which are meritorious and are regarded to be meritorious which are praiseworthy and are regarded to be praiseworthy which are to be resorted to and are regarded to be resorted to which are capable of making one an ariya and are regarded to be capable of making an ariya which purify the mind which result in meritoriousness and are praised by the wise in this world those dhammas are also found in some members of the ruling class in this world vasettha certain member of the brahmin class in this world visettha certain member of the trading class in this world vasettha certain member of the working class abstains from taking the lite of beings is nol covetous is free of ill will holds right view thus vaseltha there are those dhammas which are meritorious and are regarded to be meritorious which are praiseworthy and are regarded to be praiseworthy which are to be resorted to and are regarded to be resorted to which are capable of making one an ariya and are regarded to be capable of making one an ariya which purify the mind which result in meritoriousness and are praised by the wise in this world those dhammas are also found in some members of the working class vasettha in spite of the fact that there are the two types of dhamma one which defiles the mind the other which purifies the mind one which is reproached by the wise the other praised by the wise they are mixed together in the four social classes yet in spite of this fact the brahmins say thus ‘only the brahmin class is noble other classes are lowly only the brahmin class is fairy other classes are dark only the brahmins are pure non brahmins are not only the brahmins are the offspring of the brahma who are developed in his breast born from his mouth descended from him created by aggafina sulla him and are heirs to him the wise do not acknowledge this claim of the brahmins and why is it so vasettha from amongst the four classes certain person becomes bhikkhu who is devoid of kilesas defilements is rid of asavas has fulfilled magga practice has done all there is to be done has laid down the burden of the khandas has achieved the benetit of arahatta phala has done away with the fetters binding him to existence has attained liberation from defilements through true knowledge that person is acknowl edged to be the noblest among them according to the dhamma not at variance with the dhamma indeed vasettha in this world of sentient beings dhamma is the noblest for this life as well as for the next vasettha as the following account will also illus trate in this world of sentient beings dhamma ts the noblest for this life as well as for the next vasettha king pasenadi of kosala indeed knows ‘samana gotama has gone forth from the sakyan clan which is not different from my own clan’ now va settha the sakyans have to yield to the wishes of king pasenadi of kosala vasettha the sakyans attend upon king pasenadi of kosala in humbleness they pay homage to him they welcome him respectfully they salute him differentially with joined palms raised to the forehead they pay respect to him vaselttha in this manner the sakyans attend upon king pasenadi of kosala in humbleness pay hom age to him extend welcome to him with joined palms raised to the forehead in reverence vascttha in this manner king pasenadi of kosala at tends upon the tathagata in humbleness pays homage to him extends welcome to him shows deference to him by saluting and pays homage to him but in so doing the king did not reflect thus “samana gotama is of noble birth am not of noble birth samana gotama is fully endowed with strength of virtues am not so endowed samana gotama is of respectable and pleasing appearance am not of such appearance samana gotama is of great power am not of great power” pathika vagga as matter of fact it is because king pasenadi of kosala honours the dhamma esteems the dhamma venerates the dhamma reveres the dhamma and worships the dhamma that he attends upon me in humblcness pays homage to me welcomes me respectfully salutes me deferenuially and pays respect to me thus vasettha it should be understood that in this world of sentient beings dhamma is the noblest for this life as well as for the next vasettha you who are of different castes of difter ent names of different clans and of different families have gone forth from the household life to the homeless life in spite of that should someone ask you “who are you you should reply “we are samanas sons of the buddha of the sakyan clan” indeed vasettha certain person has faith in the tathagata which is steadfast well rooted established firmly settled and which cannot be shaken by any samanas or brahmanas deva mara brahma or by anybody in the world it is proper for that person to say thus “i am son of the bhagava developed in his breast born from his mouth arisen from the dhamma created by the dhamma and heir to the dhamma” and why is it so it is because the dhamma kaya also brahma kaya also dhamma bhuta and also brahma bhuta are the names of the tathagata indeed vasettha there is such time as when this world system gets dissolved as it does at times after lapse of many aeons when the world system becomes thus dissolved beings are reborn mostly in the abhassara plane of existence of radiant brahmas when they are born there because of jhana mind they are nurtured by rapture resplendent with light from dhamma kaya brahma bhdta the buddha thinks out the dhammas which torm the tipitaka in his mind and expounds them by word of mouth he is thus the embodiment of the dhamma hence is known as the dhamma kaya and as the dhamma is noble the tathagata embodies nobleness hence is known as brahinad kaya dealing only with pure dhamma the tathagata is also known as dhamma bhdta and hence brahma bhdta as well living in splendour and they remain there for aeons aggafinia sutta their own bodies sojourning in the heavens and indeed vasettha there is such time when this world system rises again as it does at umes after lapse of many aeons when this world system rises again beings of the abhassara realm radiant brahmas generally pass away from there to be reborn in the human world because of jhina mind they are nurtured by rapture resplendent with light from their own bodies sojourning in the heavens and living in splendour and they remain there for acons appearance of earth essence at that time vasettha the whole universe was one big mass of water completely dark enveloped in darkness there was no moon no sun no stars nor constellation had appeared no night nor day was manifest neither was there month nor half month nor year nor season there was no female nor male beings were just known as beings then vasettha after lapse of very long time there appeared for those beings the carth essence rasapathavi widely spread out on the surface of water even as boiled milk on cooling forms taut filmy layer of cream on top so was the earth essence formed on the surface of the mass of water that earth essence had pleasant colour and smell and was endowed with taste just as butter and ghee have colour so also the earth essence had colour and just as the pure honey was tasty so also the earth essence had swect laste then vasettha being of wanton greed saying ‘friend wonder how this will taste sampled the taste of the earth essence after taking it with his fingers on tasting thus the earth essence he became suffused with its favour and craving for it arose in him vasettha seeing him other beings followed his example and sampled the taste of the earth essence with their fingers on tasting thus the earth essence they became suffused with its flavour and craving for it arose in them pathika vagya appearance of the moon and the sun then vasettha those beings attempted to feast on the savoury earth essence after making it into lumps with their hands vasettha when these beings attempted to feast on the earth essence after making it into lumps with their hands their radiance disappeared as their radiance from their bodies disap peared the moon and the sun appeared as the moon and the sun appeared the stars and the constellations appeared as the stars and the constellations appeared night and day became manifest as night and day became manifest month and half month became manifest as month and half month became mani fest seasons and years became manifest in this way vascttha this world system arose again vasettha these beings existed for very very long lume feeding on the carth essence having it as their food and being nourished by it vasettha to such an extent they fed on the earth essence had it as their food and were nourished by it that their bodies became coarse and change in their appearance became manifest some beings became beautiful others became ugly amongst them the beauuful beings thought highly of themselves regard ing the ugly ones thus “we are more beautiful than those beings they are uglier than us’ because these beings became haughty through pride in their appearance the earth essence disappeared from them who were of over conceited nature when the earth essence disappeared these beings gathered to gether and lamented ‘oh how delicious oh how delicious’ nowadays people use the same expression “aho rasam aho rasan when they happen to get something tasty although they use these words they do not know their original meaning appearance of soil crust when the earth essence disappeared vasettha there appeared for these beings soil crusts just as mushrooms appear so also soil crust appeared that soil crust had pleasant colour smell and was endowed with taste just as butter and ghee have aggatifia sutta colour so also the soil crust had colour and just as pure honey is tasty so also the soil crust was tasty then vasettha those beings attempted to feed on the soil crust vasettha those beings existed for very long me feeding on the soil crust having it as their food and being nourished by it vasettha to such an extent they fed on the soil crust had it as their food and were nourished by it to that extent their bodics became coarser than before and change in their appearance became manifest some beings became beautiful others became ugly amongst them the beauuitul beings thought highly of themselves and regarded the ugly ones thus we arc more beautiful than those beings they wre uglhicr than us because those beings became haughty through pride in their appearance the soil crust disappeared from them who were over conceited in nature appearance of swect creepers when the soil crust disappeared there appeared sweet creepers just as the sweet potato vine appears so also the sweet creeper appeared the sweet creeper had pleasant colour and smell and was endowed with taste just as butter and vhee have colour so also the sweet creeper had colour and just as pure honey is tasty so also the swect creeper was lasly viaseltha those beings attempted to feed on the sweet creeper vaseltha those beings existed for very very long tme feeding on the sweet creeper having it as their food and being nourished by it vasettha to such an extent they fed on the sweet creeper had it as their food and were nourished by it to that extent their bodics became coarser than before and the change in their appearance became manifest some beings be came beautiful others became ugly amongst them the beautiful beings thought highly of themselves regarding the ugly ones thus we are more beautiful than those beings they are uglier than us’ because these beings became haughty through pride in their appearance the sweet creeper disappeared from them who were over conecited im nature when the sweet creeper disappeared those beings gath ered together and lamented “ahu vata no ahayi vata no pathika vagga “we had the sweet creeper belore now the sweet creepers are gone nowadays people use the same expression “ahu vata no ahadyi vata no when they meet with certain misfortune although they use these words they do not know the original meaning appearance of sali ricc which grows by itself when the sweet creeper disappeared there appeared for those beings the sali rice which grew by itself in unploughed fields which had no bran which had no husk which was clean and fragrant and which yields whole grains when the grains were curried away in the evening for dinner they grew again fully ripe in the morning when they were taken away in the moming for breakfast they grew again fully ripe in the evening the site from which the rice had been cut was not evident vasettha those beings existed for long long time feeding on the sah rice which grew by itsell in unploughed fields having it as their food and being nourished by it appearance of female and male organs vasettha those beings existed for very long long lime feeding on sali rice which ripened in unploughed fields having it as their food and being nourished by it to that extent their bodies became coarser than before and the changes in their appearance became manifest then female sexual organs ap peared in female bodics and male organs in male bodies with these distinctive sexual features manifesting themselves women stared at men and men stared at women thus gazing closely and intensely at one another fierce passion was aroused and consequently feverish burning was developed in their bodies because of this passion on account of this burning passion men and women began to indulge in sexual intercourse vasettha on seeing them indulging in sexual intercourse other beings threw dust at them saying “perish lowly fellow perish lowly fellow how could being treat another being in such manner others threw ash at them and still others threw cow dung at them at the present time in some districts some aggafifia sutta people threw dust some threw ash and others threw cowdung when bride is being iced away in doing so they did not know the original meaning of this custom indulgence in the habitual practice of sexual intercourse vasettha what was considered as dhamma in those primordial mes is considered as dhamma nowadays in those days beings who indulged in sexual acts were not allowed to enter the village or town for one whole month or two whole months vasettha when indulgence in the practice of sexual intercourse became excessive those beings tried to build houses to conceal their immoral acts vaseltha at thal ume this thought occurred to being who was of lazy disposition “friends why should wear myself out by fetching sali rice in the morning for the morning meal and then again in the evening for the evening meal it would be good if were to fetch sali rice only once for both the evening and the morning meal vasettha then that being fetched sali rice only once for both the evening and the morning meal visettha at that time another being approached him and said ‘come friend let us go and fetch the sali rice’ and he replied ‘friend no have fetched sali rice in single trip for both the evening and the morning meal vasettha the second being taking the example of that being fetched sali rice in one trip enough for two days ‘friend it is said that this also is good’ he said then vasettha another being approached the other be ing and said ‘come friend let us go and fetch the sali rice’ and he replied friend no have fetched sali rice in single trip enough for two days vasettha this being taking the example of that being fetched sali rice in one trip enough for four days “friends it is said that this also is good he said then vasettha another being approached the other being and said ‘come friend ict us go and fetch sali rice’ and he replied ‘friend no have fetched sali rice in single trip enough for four days vasettha this being taking the example of that being fetched sali rice in one wip cnough for eight days pathika vagga vaseltha when these beings made efforts to hoard the sali rice to feed themselves the whole grain of rice became encrusted with bran and sheathed in husk the cut olf rice stalk did not grow again into whole plant the site from which the rice had been cut became evident sali rice plants remained in clusters division of sali rice then vascttha those beings gathered together and lamented “oh friends evil dhammas have become evident in the beings formerly we were born of jhana mind we were nurtured by rapture resplendent with light from our own bodies sojourning in the heavens living thus in splendour and we remained for acons after lapse of very long long ume there appeared for us the earth essenee widely spread out on the surface of the water that carth essence had pleasant colour and smell and was endowed with taste we attempted to feast on the earth essence after making it into lumps with our hands when we atlempted to feast on the earth essence after making it into lumps with our hands our radiance disappeared as our radiance disappeared the moon and the sun appeared as the moon and the sun appeared the stars and the constellations appeared as the stars and constellations appeared might and day became manifested as night and day became manifested month and half month became manifested as month and half month be came manifested scasons and years became manifested we had existed for very long time feeding on the carth essence having it as our food and being nourished by it because evil demeritorious dhammas have become evi dent in us the earth essence had disappeared when the earth essence disappeared there appeared for us soil crust that soil crust had pleasant colour and smell and was endowed with taste we then attempted to feast on the soil crust we had existed for very long ume feeding on the soil crust having it as our food and being nourished by it because evil demeritorious dhammas had become evident in us the soil crust disappeared when the soil crust disappeared aggafifia sutta there appeared tor us sweet creeper that sweet creeper had pleasant colour and smell and was endowed with taste we then attempted to feast on those sweet creepers we had existed for very long time feeding on the sweet creeper having them as our food and being nourished by it because evil demeritorious dhammas had become evident in us the sweet crecpers disappeared when the sweet creepers disappeared there appeared for those beings sali rice which erew by itself in unploughed ficlds which had no bran which had no husk and which was clean and fragrant which yielded whole grains when the grains were carried away in the evening for dinner they grew again fully ripe in the morning when they were taken away in the morning for breakfast they grew again and became fully ripe in the evening the site from which the rice had been cut was not evident we existed for very long ume feeding on the sali rice which grew by itself in unploughed fields having it as our food and being nourished by it because evil demeritorious dhammas had become evident in us the whole grains of rice became encrusted with bran and sheathed in husk the cut off rice stalk did not grow again into whole plant the site from which the rice had been cut off became evidant sali rice plants remained in clusters it would be good if we were to divide the rice plants amongst ourselves and make demarcations then vaseltha those beings divided the rice plants amongst themselves and made demarcations then vasettha certain being of greedy disposition preserved his own allotument and took and ate another allotument which was not given to him they caught this being and told him thus ‘friend indeed you have done an evil deed while preserving your own allotment you took and ate another’s allottment which was not given to you friend don’t do such an evil deed again’ vasettha that being replied to them saying ‘yes friend’ but vasettha for the second time that being for the third ume vascttha that being preserved his own allolument took and ate another allotment which was not given to him other beings caught him and told him thus ‘friend indeed you have done an evil deed while preserving pathika vagga your allotument you look and ate another allottment which was not given to you friend don’t do such deed again’ and some beings struck him with their hands some threw stones at him some beat him with sticks vasettha this is how since that lume the practice of stealing taking what is not given appeared reviling others appeared telling lics appeared using the stick as weapon appeared the great elected king then vasettha these beings gathered together and lamented ‘oh friends indeed evil dhammas have become evi dent in the beings the practice of taking what is not given appeared reviling others appeared telling lies appeared using the slick as weapon appeared it would be good if we were to elect certain being who will reprimand one who should rightly be reprimanded revile one who should rightly be reviled and banish one who should rightly be banished and we would give him an extra share of the sali rice’ viasettha then they approached certain being trom amongst themselves who was very handsome very fair to be hold very pleasing to the eye and was very powerful and said to him ‘come man reprimand one who should rightly be reprimanded revile one who should rightly be reviled banish one who should rightly be banished shall we give you an extra share of the sali rice’ vasettha that being replied to them ‘very well friends’ then he reprimanded one who should rightly be reprimanded reviled one who should rightly be reviled and banished one who should rightly be banished and they gave him an extra share of sali rice vasettha because he was elected by the people the first appellation ‘mahasammata mahasammata’ came into use because he was ruler over all fields the second appellation ‘khattiya khattiya’ came into use because he was pleasing to the people through his righteousness the third appellation ‘raja raja’ came into use vasettha such was the appearance of the ruling class according to the original ancient appellation this aggafina sutta appellation belongs only to those beings not to any other being this appellation belongs only to beings of the same class not to those of different class this appellation appeared only in accordance with the dhamma not at variance with the dhamma indeed vasettha in this world of sentient beings dhamma is the noblest for this life as well as for the next the brahmin class then vdsettha to some of those beings it occurred thus ‘friends indeed evil dhammas have become evident in the beings the practice of taking what is not given appeared reviling others appeared telling lics appeared using the stick as weapon appeared banishing others appeared it would be good if we were to wash away the evil demeritorious dhammas and they washed away the evil demeritorious dhammas vasettha because they washed away the evil demeritorious dhammas the first appellation ‘brahmana brahmana’ came into use building huts with leaf roofs in forests they practised jhana there for them extinguished were the kitchen fires and extinct were the smoke from them unuuilized lay the mortar and pestle since they did not cook their meals they visited villages towns and royal cities seeking food in the evenings for evening meals and in the morning for morning meals having got their food they again practised jhana in the leaf roofed huts in the forest when men saw them they said “friends these beings build huts with leaf rools in the forest and there they practise jhana for them extinguished were the kitchen fires and extinct were the smoke from them unutilized lay the mortar and pestle since they did not cook their meals they visited villages towns and royal cities seeking food in the cvening for evening meals and in the morning for morning meals having got their food they again practised jhina in the leaf roofed huts in the forest’ vasettha because they practised jhana the second appellation ‘jhayaka jhayaka’ came into use for them vasettha some of those beings failing to achieve jhana in the leaf roofed huts in the forests approached and settled pathika vagga down on the outskirts of villages and towns and wrote and taught vedic books when men saw them they said ‘friends these beings unable to achieve jhana in the leaf roofed huts in the forests approached and setthd down on the outskirts of towns and villages they wrote and taught the vedas they could not now achieve jhana vasettha because they could not achieve jhana the third appellation “ajjhdyaka ajjhadyaka’ came inlo use vasettha in those days that occupation and teaching vedas was considered lowly nowadays it is considered quite respectable noble vasettha such was the arising of the brahmin class brahmana mandala is according to the original ancient appellauion this appellation belongs only to those beings not to any other this appellation belongs only to beings of the same class not to those of different class this appellation arose only in accordance with the dhamma not at variance with the dhamma indeed vasettha in this world of sentient beings dhamma is the noblest for this life as well as for the next the trading class vasettha some of those very beings who indulged in sexual acts took to married hfe and engaged themselves in various trades such as commerce animal husbandry and ftarm ing and because they indulged in sexual acts and engaged themselves in various trades the appellation vessa vessa’ came into use vasettha such was the arising of the trading class vessa mandala according to the ancient original appellation this appellation belongs only to those beings not to any other this appellation belongs only to beings of the same class not to those of different class this appellation arose only in accor dance with the dhamma not al variance with the dhamma indeed vasettha in this world of sentient beings dhamma is the noblest for this life as well as for the next aggaftina sutta the working class vasettha of those very beings the remaining ones earned their living by hard toil and petty occupations because they earned their living by petty occupations the appellation ‘suddha suddha” came into use vasettha such was the arising of the working class suddha mandala according to the original ancient appellation this appellation belongs only to those be ings not to any other this appellation belongs only to beings of the same class not to those of different class this appellation arose only in accordance with the dhamma not on variance with the dhamma indeed vascttha in the world of sentient beings dhamma is the noblest for this life as well as for the next vasettha there came time when there were members of the khattiya class disapproving their own dhammas went forth from houschold life into the homeless life saying will become samana vasettha there were also members of the brahmin class vasettha there were also members of the urading class wasettha there were also members of the working class disapproving their own dhamma went forth from household life into homeless life saying ‘i will become samana’ vasettha it is only from these four classes that the class of samanas arose this appellation samana mandala belongs only to those beings not to any other this appellation belongs only to beings of the same class not to those of different class this appellation arose only in accordance with the dhamma not at variance with the dhamma indeed vasettha in this world of sentient beings dhamma is the noblest for this life as well

sensible your speech is not coherent and sensible what you should say first you say last and what you should say last you say first what you have long practised to say has been upset now have exposed the fault in your doctrine you stand’ rebuked try to escape from this censure or explain it if you can it seemed that these disciples of nigantha nataputta had only one thought that of destroying one another just as one gets wearied of is displeased with and has no more high regard for teaching which is not well taught not well imparted not conducive to attain ment of the path and fruition nor to eradication of defilements which is taught by one who is not perfectly enlightened and which has lost its mainstay and is devoid of any refuge even so nigantha nataputta’s white robed lay followers became disgusted with and displeased with the disciples of nigantha taputta they lost respect for them pathika vagga then cunda samanuddesa having passed the rains retreat at pava cane to sec the

thus ‘samapa gotama manifests an infinite knowledge and insight concerning the past but concerning the future he does not manifest such knowledge and insight why is it so what is the reason for this the wandering ascetics of other faiths just like stupid and foolish persons are under the impression that knowledge and insight of certain set of thin should be similarly manifested in knowledge and ‘cdiait of another set of things cunda concerning the past the tathagata has the knowledge and mindfulness by which he recollects pre vious existences he can recall existences as far back as he wishes

recluses outside of this teaching have memorized these thirty two bodily marks of great man but they do not know thus ‘for having done this action this bodily mark is acquired’ mark of level touching feet bhikkhus during the rounds of previous births existences and abodes when he happened to be born in the human world the tathagata was steadfast and firmly fixed in the practice of meritorious acts namely good actions in deeds words and thoughts acts of charity and distribution of alms keeping the moral precepts observing uposatha precepts on uposatha days attending to filial duties that should be done for mother and father attending to duties due to samanas and brahmanas venerating the elders in the family he engages himself steadtastly and firmly also in other acts of extraordinary merits that will lead to attainment of sabbafifiuta nana for having done these meritorious deeds constsntly and continuously having accumulated it in abundance and having performed it extensively and unlimitedly after death and dissolu tion of his body he was reborn in the happy world of the devas there in the deva world the bhagava surpassed other devas in ten aspects of celestial qualities namely durauion of life appearance happiness retinue authority and the five celes tial sense objects of sight sound odour taste and touch having passed away from the deva world he is reborn in this human world and becomes endowed with this mark of great man namely having feet the soles of which touch the performance of meritorious acts in the human world the bodhisatta had also had previous existences in the deva world the brahma realm and as some kind of animal because there is excessive pleasures for enjoyment in the deva world and brahma realm lithe opportunity exists for performance of meritorious deeds in the animal world too because of much suffering very litthey opportunity exists there for performance of meritorious deeds it is only in the human world where there is comparatively less pleasures to enjoy and less suffering opportunity exists for performance of such meritorious deeds as to result in the appearance of thirty two bodily marks of great man lakkhana

brahmanas or devas or maras or brahmas or by anyone else in the world this is what he gains as an enlightened one the bhagavad spoke on this pathika vagga at this stage the theras of the great synod recited this verse the bhagava finds delight in the practice of speaking only what is true in the performance of ten kinds of merito rious deeds in the restraint of the faculties in controlling the actions by deed word or thought and keeping these actions pure in the observance of precepts which form the foundation for the practice of concentration meditation and vipassana meditation in the observance of updsatha precepts on updsatha days in giving alms in causing no harm to beings and in not maltreating them he is steadfast in these meritorious practices and is fully accomplished in them in consequence of that kamma he was reborn in the deva world where he enjoys the happiness the merry making and pleasure seeking of the deva realm he passes away from there and is again reborn in the human world where he touches the ground squarely and evenly with the soles of his fect the prophesying brahmin seers come together and declare no recluse or laymen can cause obstruction to him who is born with level touching feet this mark of level touching feet indicates such benefits to one born with it if he remains as householder in consequence of his previous deeds of merit he cannot be removed from his position by any human being he conquers others and cannot be crushed by enemies there is no human being in this world who can remove him from his position if one who possesses that mark goes forth from the household life into the homeless life he is bound to become buddha who desires for and finds delight in renunciation of all worldly things and who is endowed with wisdom being topmost supreme amongst beings indeed he cannot be re moved trom his position such is the nature of that mark this is in accordance with the commentary the verse is attributed to the venerable ananda

superior status who do not believe in the bhagava and there are yakkhas of superior status who believe in the bhagava there are yakkhas of medium status who do not believe in the bhagava and there are yakkhas of medium status who believe in the bhagava and there are yakkhas of inferior status who do not believe in the bhagava and there are yakkhas of inferior status who believe in the bhagava

misconduct from telling lies from taking or using intoxicants which causes negligence venerable sir the yakkhas do not generally abstain from taking life from taking what is not given from sexual misconduct from telling lies and from indulging in intoxicants which cause negligence they do not like that teaching and are not pleased with it eet eg fe guards at the fourth quarter inside of the

the bhagava to teach the protecting stanza known as the atdnatiya paritta so that bhikkhus bhikkhunis lay male disciples and lay female disciples may be well guarded well protected” the bhagava gave his consent by remaining silent then the great deva king vessavana noting the accep tance of the bhagava recited at that time this atanatiya paritta my veneration to vipassi buddha possessor of the

which removes all sufferings in this world all these buddhas such as vipassi buddha etc who had extinguished the flames of defilements perceived the true nature of all phenomena as they really are these buddhas do not slander’ they are noble persons they are free from all fears although vessavana in his recitation ascribed seven different attributes to the seven buddhas in fact all the buddhas possess each of these attributes it should be taken also that they refrain from telling lies from using abusive language and engaging in frivolous talks as well the com mentary atanatiya sutta the devas and men pay homage to gotama buddha who is their benefactor who is endowed with penetrative knowledge and perfect course of practice who is noble and who is fearless my veneration to that gotama

delighted those bhikkhus re joiced at the words of the bhagava end of atanatiya sutta the ninth sutta namo tassa bhagavato arahato sammasambuddhassa sanigiti sutta sangiti sutta discourse given at the newly built congregation hall in pava the capital city of the malla princes thus have heard at one time while the bhagava was journeying through the country of the mallas with large company of bhikkhus numbering five hundred he arrived at pava the capital city of the malla kingdom and stayed in the mango grove of cunda the son of goldsmith “new congregation hall named ubhataka” now there was new congregation hall of the mallas of pava it had not yet been occupied by any samana or brahmana or by any other human being it was built recently and was named ubhataka the mallas of pava heard the news thus “while the bhagava was journeying through the country of the mallas with large company of bhikkhus numbering five hundred he had arrived at pava the capital city of the malla kingdom and was staying in the mango grove of cunda the son of goldsmith the mallas of pava then came to the bhagava after making homage to the bhagava they sat down at certain place having thus taken their seats they addressed the bhagava thus “venerable sir in this city there is new recently built assembly hall of the mallas of pava which was named ubhataka and which has not yet been occupied by any samana or brahmana or any human being venerable sir may it please the bhagava to be the first to make use of the hall after the bhagava has made use of it the mallas of pava will use it later making use of that assembly hall by the bhagava first would mean prosperity and happiness for the mallas of pava for long time the bhagava assented by remaining silent then the mallas of pava knowing that the bhagava had consented rose from their seats paid obeisance to the bhagava and left respectfully keeping their right side to him they went to the new assembly hall covered the floor all over pathika vagga with floor coverings prepared seats for the bhagava placed big water pot in position and set up oil lamps in their holders then they went back to the bhagava made obeisance to him stood in suitable place and addressed the bhagava thus ‘venerable sir floor coverings have been spread al over the hall seats have been prepared for the bhagava water pol has been placed in position oil lamps have been set up in their holders venerable sir now the bhagavad knows the ume to leave for the hall’ then the bhagava suitably re arranged the robes he wore and taking alms bowl and great robe proceeded to the assembly hall together with the company of bhikkhus there he washed his feet entered the hall and seated himself against the middle post facing east the bhikkhus also washed their feet entered the assembly hall and sat down against the west wall facing east with the bhagava in front of them the bhikkhus also washed their feet entered the assem bly hall and sat against the east wall facing west with the bhagava in front of them then for large part of the night the bhagava dis coursed on the dhamma to the mallas of pava revealing to them the benefits urging them to take it up stirring up their zeal and gladdening their hearts then the bhagava said to them thus ‘mallas of vasettha it is past the first watch of the night you know the time to leave’ ‘very well venerable sir said the mallas of pava and rose from their seats did obeisance to the bhagava and left respectfully keeping their right side to him then soon after the mallas of pava had left the bhagava after looking over the whole company of bhikkhus vasettha is the name of the lineage to which the mallas belong looking over the whole company of bhikkhus anuviloketva the commentary explains that the buddha looks at the bhikkhus not only with the mansa cakkhu the physical eye but also with dibba cakkhu the divine power of sight with which he sees the mental states of the bhikkhus sangiti sutta sitting in complete silence said to the venerable sariputta “sariputta the bhikkhus are free from sloth and torpor let the dhamma be clear to you so as to give discourse on it to the bhikkhus my back is aching shall stretch it’ ‘very well venerable sir’ replied the venerable sariputta to the bhagava then the bhagava had the great robe folded into four layers laid it on couch and lay down on it on his right side in noble reclining posture placing the left foot on and little beyond the right foot completely mindful and aware making mental note of the time to get up ‘story of split amongst niganthas’ at that time nigantha son of nata had just passed away at pava because of his death his disciples were split into two parties they were argumentative quarrelsome discordant and were bickering at one another with piercing words “you do not know the doctrine and the discipline know this doctrine and discipline how can you ever know this doctrine and discipline your practice is

to the sanigha and without fulfilling the training to completion causes contention among the samgha and this contention does not tend to welfare and happiness of the multi tude it tends to the

accomplishments to dwell in suitable locality to associate with the virtuous to set one self on the right course to have done good deeds previously these four dhammas bring much benefit which four dhammas should be developed the four methods of steadfast mindfulness in this teaching friends bhikkhu remains keeping his mind steadfastly on the body with diligence comprehension and mindfulness thus dispelling covet ousness and distress concerning the world on sensation on the mind he remains keeping his mind on the dhammas with diligence comprehension and mindfulness thus dispelling

item of sangiti sutta dasuttara sutta the five dhammas five dhammas bring much benefit five dhammas should be developed five dhammas should be realized which five dhammas bring much benefit five quali ties required of one who is striving in the practice of meditation in this teaching friends bhikkhu has conviction fully believ ing in the perfect enlightenment of the tathagata ‘thus indeed that bhagava is worthy of special veneration he truly compre hends the dhamma by his own intellect and insight he possesses penetrative knowledge and perfect course of practice he speaks only what is beneficial and true he knows all the three lokas he is incomparable in taming those who deserve to be tamed he is the teacher of devas and men he is the enlightened one knowing and teaching the four ariya truths he is the most exalted’ he is free from illness and affliction and is endowed with the element of internal heat promoting food digestion neither too strong nor too weak but moderate and appropriate for meditative endeavour he is without hypocrisy or guile acting openly and presenting himself as he truly is to the teacher or to the wise companions in the noble practice he dwells with strenuous resolution to eleminate demeritorious factors and to acquire meritorious factors and he is steadfastly energetic without ever laying down his task of striving for meritorious factors he has wisdom being endowed with vipassana insight which leads to discriminative discernment of the arising and disappearance of the five khandhas and which is noble which is able to penetrate and destroy the mass of defilements and which effectively leads to the end of all dukkha these five dhammas bring much benefit which five dhammas should be developed right concentration characterised by five factors suffusion of piti in the first and second jhanas suffusion of sukha in the first second and third jhanas suffusion of the mind of other people suffusion of light in dibbacakkhu fiana and sign of reviewing knowledge these five dhammas should be developed pathika vagga which five dhammas should be understood fully five aggregates which are the objects of clinging the aggregate of

which is the object of clinging the aggregate of consciousness which is the object of clinging these five dhammas should be understood fully which five dhammas should be abandoned five mental obstructions in this teaching friends bhikkhu has doubt uncertainty perplexity and lack of clarity concerning the teacher friends the mind of that bhikkhu who is doubtful uncertain perplexed and unclear concerning the teacher does not incline to exertion repeated exertion continued exertion and strenuous exertion this lack of inclination to make exertion repeated exertion continued exertion and strenuous exertion of that bhikkhu is the first mental obstruction and again friends bhikkhu has doubt uncertainty concerning the teaching has doubt uncertainty concerning the samgha has doubt uncertainty concerning the practice of training he is angry displeased sore at heart and fractious with his companions in the noble practice the mind of that bhikkhu who is angry displeased sore at heart and fractious with his companions in the noble practice does not incline to exertion repeated exertion continued exertion and strenuous exertion this lack of inclination to make exertion repeated exertion continued exertion and strenuous exertion of that bhikkhu is the fifth mental obstruction which five dhammas lead to progress the five faculties faculty of conviction faculty of endeavour faculty of mindfulness faculty of concentration faculty of wisdom these five dhammas lead to progress which five dhammas are hard to penetrate five elements which tend to release the mind from opposite factors in this teaching friends when bhikkhu thinks about sense desires his mind does not leap forwards to them does not find satisfaction in them does not become established in them dasuttara sutta does not lean towards them but when he thinks about the renunciation of sense desires his mind leaps forward to it finds satisfaction in it becomes established in it and leans towards it this frame of mind of that bhikkhu gets well established well developed emerges from sense desires well liberated and de tached from them he is free from asavas and other destructive and burning defilements that might arise in consequence of sense desires and he is freed from them and does not experience that sensation this is said to be liberation from sense desires and again friends when bhikkhu thinks about ill will his mind does not leap forward to it does not find satisfaction in it does not become established in it does not lean towards it but when he thinks about goodwill his mind leaps forward to it finds satisfaction in it becomes established in it and leans towards it this frame of mind of that bhikkhu gets well established well developed emerges from ill will well

destructive and burning defilements that might arise in conse quence of corporeality and he does not experience that sensation this is said to be liberation from corporeality and again friends when bhikkhu thinks about bodily entity khandha which are the object of clinging his mind does not leap forwards to it does not find satisfaction in it does not become established in it does not lean

bhikkhu gets well established well developed emerges from it well liberated from it and detached from it he is free from asavas and other destructive and burning defilements that might arise in conse quence of bodily entity and he does not experience that sensa tion this is said to be liberation from the bodily entity these five dhammas are hard to penetrate which five dhammas should be caused to arise right concentration associated with five kinds of knowledge the reflective knowledge arises in one as personal experience ‘this concentration makes him happy in the present and it will result in happiness in the future too’ the reflective knowledge arises in one as personal experience ‘this concentration is pure and unrelated to worldly things’ the reflective knowledge arises in one as personal experience “this concentration is one that is pursued by noblest persons’ the reflective knowledge arises in one as personal experience ‘this concentration is calm it is excellent it arises in consequence of calming of defilements it is gained as ‘one pointedness’ of mind this concentration is achieved without any effort to suppress the hindrances’ the reflective knowledge arises in one as personal experience ‘mindfully enter this state of concentration mind fully emerge from this state of concentration’ these five dhammas should be caused to arise dasuttara sutta which five dhammas should be known by special apperception five bases for emancipations in this teaching friends the teacher or respectable companion in the noble practice teaches the dhamma to bhikkhu to that extent that teacher or respectable companion teaches the dhamma to the bhikkhu he comes to know the meaning and the text of the dhamma to him who comes to know the meaning and the text of the dhamma there arises delight to him who is delighted there arises satisfaction to him who has delightful satisfaction the mental and physical body calms down the bhikkhu whose mental and physical body calms down experiences happiness for him who experi ences happiness the mind becomes concentrated this is the first base for emancipation and again friends neither the teacher nor any respect able companion in the noble practice teaches the dhamma to bhikkhu and yet he himself teaches the dhamma to others in detail as he has heard and learnt it friends the extent that he teaches the dhamma to others in detail as he has heard and learnt it he comes to know the meaning and the text of the dhamma to him who comes to know the meaning and the text of the dhamma there arises delight to him who is delighted there arises satisfaction to him who has delightful satisfaction the mental and physical body calms down the bhikkhu whose mental and physical body culms down experiences happiness for him who experiences happiness the mind becomes concen trated this is the second base for emancipation and again friends neither the teacher nor any respect able companion in the noble practice teaches the dhamma to bhikkhu he does not teach the dhamma to others in detail as he has heard and learnt it and yet he repeatedly goes over the dhamma reciting it in detail as he has heard and learnt it friends to the extent that he recites the dhamma in detail as he has heard and learnt it he comes to know the meaning and the text of the dhamma to him who comes to know the meaning and the text of the dhamma there arises delight to him who is delighted there arises salisfaction to him who has pathika vagga delightful satisfaction the mental and physical body calms down the bhikkhu whose mental and

text of the dhamma there arises delight to him who is delighted there arises satisfaction to him who has delightful satisfaction the mental and physical body calms down the bhikkhu whose mental and physical body calms down experiences happiness for him who experiences happiness the mind becomes concentrated this is the fourth base for emanci pation and again friends neither the teacher or

reciting it in detail as he has heard and learnt it nor does he repeatedly think about it repeatedly goes over it in the mind and repeatedly contemplates it as he has heard and learnt it and yet he has grasped at one of the signs of concentration he fixes his mind intently on it observes it well and gains penetrative knowledge of it friends to the extent that he grasps at one of the signs of concentration fixes his mind intently on it observes it well and gains penetrative knowledge of it he comes to know the meaning and the text of the dhamma to him who comes to dasuttara sutta know the meaning and the text of the dhamma there arises delight to him who is delighted there arises satisfaction to him who has delightful satisfaction the mental and physical body calms down the bhikkhu whose mental and physical body calms down experiences happiness for him who experiences happiness the mind becomes concentrated this is the fifth base for emancipation which five dhammas should be realised the five groups of dhamma the group of morality the group of concen tration the group of wisdom the group of emancipation the group of knowledge and insight of emancipation these five dhammas should be realized thus these fifty dhammas which are true real correct not incorrect not otherwise are fully and clearly comprehended by the tathagata the six dhammas six dhammas bring much benefit six dhammas should be developed six dhammas should be realized which six dhammas bring much benefit six memorable factors in this teaching friends bhikkhu shows goodwill to the companions in the noble practice in deed both in their presence and in their absence this kind of act which is memo rable which tends to loving kindness and which tends to respect is conducive to fraternity concord harmony and unanimity and again friends bhikkhu shows goodwill to the companions in the noble practice in speech this kind of speech is conducive to harmony and unanimity and again friends bhikkhu shows goodwill to the companions in the noble practice in thought this kind of thought is conducive to unanimity and again friends when bhikkhu receives offerings righteously to say the least even if the contents of his alms bowl were just sufficient for himself he shares them with his compan ions in the noble practice without making use of them apart from others this kind of act too which is memorable conducive to unanimity pathika vagga and again friends bhikkhu remains observing the same precepts with his companions in the noble practice both in their presence and in their absence those precepts which are unbroken intact unspoiled unblemished and which lead to liberation from slavery to cravings which are praised by the wise which are not subject to craving and wrong views and which are conducive to concentration of the mind this obser vance of morality too which is memorable is conducive to unanimity and again friends bhikkhu remains abiding the same precepts with his companions in the noble practice both in their presence and in their absence in pure insight which leads to nibbana and which truly leads one who acts upon it to the utter destruction of dukkha this kind of abiding too which is memo rable which tends to loving kindness and which tends to respect is conducive to fraternity concord harmony and unanimity these six dhammas bring much benefit which six dhammas should be developed six dhammas should be repeatedly recollected recollection of the buddha recollection of the dhamma recollection of the samgha recol lection of morality recollection of generosity recollection of the virtues of the devas these six dhammas should be developed which six dhammas should be understood fully six internal sense bases eye base ear base nose base tongue base body base and mind base these six dhammas should be understood fully which six dhammas should be abandoned six groups of craving craving for visible objects craving for sound craving for odours craving for taste craving for tangible objects craving for mind objects these six dhammas should be abandoned which six dhammas lead to decline six kinds of disrespect in this teaching friends bhikkhu remains without respect for and without deference to the teacher he remains without respect for and without deference to the teaching samgha training mindfulness he remains without respect for and

the full collection of fifty suttas from mdlapannasa the first division of majjhima nikaya the collection of medium length suttas of the fifty suttas from the milapannasa twenty five suttas have been pub lished by the myanmar pitaka association in the present book fills up the gaps in that book “twenty five suttas from milapannasa subsequently this book will be followed by full collections of suttas from majjhimapannasa and uparipannasa both from majjhima nikaya we sincerely hope that the present book will be warmly reccived by all our readers is sann lwin director general kaba aye yangon introduction the majjhima nikaya or collection of medium length discourses is the second of the five nikayas or collections of the sayings of the buddha it consists of three divisions containing suttas or discourses the first division called mialapannasa contains fifty suttas the second division called majjhimapannasa has fifty suttas and the third division called uparipannasa has fifty two suttas each of the three divisions is sub divided into five vaggas with ten suttas under each vagga in the first and second divisions pannasas and twelve suttas under the last sub division of the third division of the fifty suttas of the mdlapannasa twenty five have been published by the myanmar pitaka association mpa in the remaining twenty five have now been edited and together with the first twenty five complete book of milapannasa is brought out for the reading public the majority of the discourses here are made by the buddha himself while discourses by sariputta moggallana and mahakacc ana also feature prominently htogue between bhikkhuni arahat dhammadinna and bhikkhu visdkha on abstruse points of dhamma is also memorable culavedalla sutta variety of themes can be found in this collection these are presented with interesting similes for instance there is the simile of the elephant’s footprint just as the footprint of the elephant is the biggest among the footprints of all animals and can contain any one of them all the merito rious states of mind are included in the four ariya truths as regards the truth of dukkha or woefulness of repeated re births of the cessation of dukkha and the way leading to the cessation of dukkha in this discourse made to the bhikkhus by the venerable sariputta the first chief disciple of the buddha vi vill introduction and “the marshal of the dhamma” the doctrine of dukkha is explained in detail rebirth repeated coming into exist ence is dukkha ageing is dukkha death is also dukkha grief lamentation pain distress and despair are also dukkha not getting what one wants is also dukkha in brief the five aggregates which are the objects of clinging are dukkha the five aggregates which are the objects of clinging are corporeality aggregate sensation aggregate perception aggregate volition aggregate and consciousness aggregate fur ther each of these five aggregates which are the objects of clinging is elaborated for instance corporeality is made up of four primary elements namely pathavi or the element of extension or solidity po or the element of fluidity and cohesion tejo or the element of heat and cold and vayo or the element of motion besides the pathavi element in oneself there is also the pathavi element outside oneself both the internal pathavi and external pathavi are merely primary element and the four primary elements either external or internal are liable to change and destruction they have the character of imperma nence that which is impermanent should not be clung to as “this is mine this is this is my self atta bhikkhu reflecting thus will no more cling to the primary elements in oneself furthermore the nature of sensation is explained sen sation arises due to cause the cause is sensory impingement the contact between sense base and its respective sense object such as ear and sound contact is transitory imperma nent ‘the discourse likewise explains the transitory nature of the five aggregates that are the objects of clinging all of these dhammas are impermanent woeful or unsatisfactory and non self anicca dukkha anatta sariputta points out the buddha’s saying “he who sees the causal law paticcasamuppada sees the dhamma he who introduction sees the dhamma sees the causal law the five aggregates which are the objects of clinging are dependent on condi tioned by appropriate factors desire for attachment to these five aggregates which are the objects of clinging is the cause of dukkha the abandonment of desire for and attachment to them mean the cessation of dukkha mahahatthipadopama sutta there was bhikkhu named sati who said “as understand the dhamma as taught by the buddha it is the same consciousness that runs on from existence to existence and not another his pronouncement came to the ear of the buddha sati was summoned before the presence of the bud dha who severely reprimanded the bhikkhu and gave dis course on the causal arising of consciousness without cause there arises no consciousness dependent on certain cause consciousness arises for instance dependent on eye and vis ible object consciousness arises then it is simply called eye consciousness similarly dependent on ear and sound con sciousness arises then it is simply called ear consciousness gradually the buddha proceeded to expound the law of cause and effect paticcasamuppada often rendered as dependent origination or conditioned arising when this cause exists that effect comes to be when this cause does not exist that effect does not come to be because of the cessation of this cause that effect also ceases so it is that dependent on ignorance volitional activities arise dependent on volitional activity consciousness arises dependent on consciousness mind and body nama rupa arises dependent on nama rupa the six sense bases arise dependent on the six sense bases contact arises dependent on contact sensation arises dependent on sensation craving arises dependent on craving clinging arises dependent on clinging bhava kammic causal process leading to further rebirth arises dependent on bhava rebirth arises dependent on rebirth there arise ageing death grief lamenta tion pain distress and despair in this way occurs the arising xx introduction of this entire mass of dukkha only with the total cessation of ignorance through rahatta magga volitional activities cease with the cessation of volitional activity consciousness ceases with the cessation of consciousness mind and body nama rupa ceases with the cessation of nama ripa the six sense bases cease with the cessation of the six sense bases contact ceases with the ces sation of contact sensation ceases with the cessation of sen sation craving ceases with the cessation of craving clinging ceases with the cessation of clinging bhava kammic causal process leading to further rebirth ceases with the cessation of bhava rebirth ceases with the cessation of rebirth ageing death grief lamentation pain distress and despair cease in this way occurs the cessation of this entire mass of dukkha mahatanhasarikhaya sutta the causal law or paticcasamuppada is the noble insight that leads to enlightenment or the understanding of the four ariya truths it is the insight that led to the perfect enlightenment of the buddha accordingly it is recurring topic in many of the discourses in all the collections here in this collection we have further discussion on paficcasamuppada in ciasihanada sutta in this discourse the buddha makes the “lion’s roar” of declaring boldly that only in this teaching there are the four types of samanas namely the stream winner sotapanna the once returner sakadagami the non returner anagdmi and the arahat these cannot be found in other systems of teaching the buddha continues with the question of clinging other teachers outside the buddha’s teaching claim to know ‘linging but they know only about clinging to sense pleasures whereas there are four kinds of clinging clinging to sense pleasures clinging to wrong beliefs clinging to practices outside the ariya path of eight constituents and clinging to the wrong view about self atta the buddha declares that those teachers are not set free from rebirth and its woeful introduction xi consequences they are liable to fare along the journey of continued existence why is it so it is because they do not comprehend clinging to atta self as the one factor that causes the continuation of samisara the buddha points out that clinging arises due to craving clinging has craving as cause as source craving has sensation as cause sensation has contact as cause thus tracing the cause or source of contact and the conditioning factors in the chain of causality there are the six sense bases mind and body nama ripa conscious ness sankhara or volitional activities ignorance when bhikkhu rids himself of ignorance and knowledge leading to arahatta magga has arisen in him with the absence of igno rance and by the arising of knowledge he does not cling to sense pleasures nor to wrong view nor to rites and practices outside the ariya path of eight constituents nor to the wrong view about the ego through the quenching of the burning defilements he attains in this very life the ultimate peace nibbana culasithanada sutta the causal law in connection with right view involv ing the twelve factors of paticcasamuppada is discussed in an elaborate way also in the sammaéaditthi sutta the simile of the pith or heart wood is employed in the buddha’s discourse to the bhikkhus on mount gijjhakuta near rajagaha one who searches for heart wood needs to know what is heart wood not knowing it and collecting leaves of big tree or the outer crust or sapwood would not fulfil his purpose on the same analogy in this teaching if one who takes up the noble practice feels contented with material gains honour and fame he is like the one who went into the forest in search of heart wood but comes back gath zring leaves of big tree bhikkhu who feels contented with the gaining of perfection in morality is like the one who went into the forest in search of heart wood and finding big tree comes away taking the outer crust there are higher things to be achieved by him under the teaching and then bhikkhu xii introduction who feels contented with complete concentration is like the one who went into the forest in search of heart wood and comes away taking the bark he ought to strive for higher things in the noble practice attainment of supernormal psy chic powers is like the sap wood it is only the bhikkhu who like the man knowing what is heart wood strives for the extinction of defilements and thereby makes an end of dukkha is the true son of the buddha mahasaropama sutta the perils of sense pleasures is subject often recur ring in the discourses the five kinds of sense pleasures are then named the buddha expounds on the evils of sense pleasure as source of civil strife destruction and unhappi ness and also as sure passport to the realms of continuous suffering niraya he then relates his encounter with group of niganthas who were followers of najaputta they were in the course of practising whereby they refrained from sitting down and by remaining in standing posture all the time that brought them painful sharp and bitter suffering they said to the buddha “friend gotama happiness cannot be achieved through happiness it can only be achieved through pain friend gotama if happiness is achieved through happiness king seniya bimbisara of magadha should have happiness king bimbisara should be living in greater happiness than the venerable gotama to this the buddha put counter ques tion what do you think of this is king seniya bimbisara of magadha able to live in the enjoyment of nothing but happi ness for seven nights and days without moving his body or uttering word “no friend he is not on further questioning by the buddha the niganthas said that king seniya bimbisara would not be able to live without moving his body or uttering word for one day in the enjoyment of nothing but happiness the buddha said that he could live without moving his body or uttering word for seven mights and seven days in the enjoyment of nothing but happiness this means that the buddha was able to dwell in introduction xi the absorption of fruition phala samapatti ca adukkhakkhandha sutta in ancient india holiness was identified with asceticism only through ascetic practice could one attain saintliness prince siddhattha the buddha to be himself tried asceticism to the extreme alone in uruvela forest in recounting these painful years of his ascetic practice the buddha said “sdriputta because ate so little my gaunt ribs became like the crazy rafters of tumble down shed if thought ‘i will touch the skin of my belly’ it was my backbone that took hold of if thought ‘i will touch my backbone it was the skin of my belly that took hold of for because ate so little the ‘skin of my belly came to be cleaving to my backbone mahasihanada sutta the buddha found out the hard way that self torment was no good for enlightenment and he preached the doctrine of the middle way the practical way that neither veers to sensuality nor to self torture sunakkhatta lacchavi prince spoke words in dispraise of the buddha he said the buddha possessed no special knowledge and insight that enable one to become an ariya and that transcends the dhamma practised by ordinary human be ings when the venerable sariputta heard that speech as it was spoken to group of people in vesali the venerable one reported about it to the bhagava on learning the news the bhagavad made bold decla ration about the ten powers of the buddha that entitle him to claim the leader’s place to roar his lion’s roar in assemblies and to set rolling the wheel of dhamma he explained the ten powers in detail then he declared that he possesses the four convictions vesarajja and explained them in detail further he explained about the four kinds of conception and the five destinations and the names of individuals faring in the various destinations which the buddha sees with his mind comprehending the mind of those individuals the bhagava xiv introduction then described how he became an ascetic and carried out various extreme ascetic practices that made him claim as the foremost ascetic and now if people were to say that in his old age this man is old and worn out his faculties would fail and he falls from his lucidity of wisdom he says the buddha now at eighty has lucidity of wisdom as sharp as ever he declared “a being not liable to delusion has arisen in the world for the welfare of the multitude for the happiness of the many during the days when the buddha was residing in the gosinga sal wood the venerable moggallana and five other great bhikkhu elders happened to be together in the sal wood under clear moonlight the sal trees were in full bloom their scents being wafted around as the fragrance of deva world the venerable sdriputta said to the venerable ananda “revered ananda what kind of bhikkhu can grace the gosin ga sal wood the venerable ananda replied that bhikkhu who has heard much of the expositions of the teaching remembers them well reflects on them and teaches the dhamma is one who can grace the gosinga sal wood the other bhikkhus also were asked in turn about their opinions and each answered according to his natural bent of mind thus one who can grace the gosinga sal wood is one who delights in solitary seclusion who strives constantly for tranquillity who is en dowed with jhana and vipassana insight he is one who has gained the psychic power of the divine eye one who practises the prescribed austerities such as forest dwelling rag robe wearing keeping only three robes etc and who praises the virtue of austerity practice who makes energetic effort who is possessed of perfect morality concentration and wis dom and who attains liberation one who discusses abhidhamma with another bhikkhu one who has complete mastery over his mind being able to enter upon my sustained jhana or phala at will introduction xv when the six elder bhikkhus reported about their dis cussions to the bhagava the teacher praised them all for their opinions as right and proper since each reflected the natural bent of mind of the speaker the bhagava himself said the bhikkhu who establishes mindfulness in meditation firmly resolved to persist in it till he is free of defilements is one who can grace the gosiniga sal wood mahagosinga sutta peace and harmony among the community of bhikkhus is subject dealt with in the discourses in cilagosiniga sutta the venerables anuruddha nandiya and kambila are shown as living in harmony in the gositiga sal wood on the buddha asking whether they are living in harmony the venerable anuruddha replies that they are living in harmony as milk and water blend regarding one another with the eye of affection the details of their daily routine are given here which makes an interesting and inspiring reading anuruddha is saying here “venerable sir having surrendered my own mind am living only according to the mind of these venerable ones venerable sir we have diverse bodies but assuredly only one mind the venerable anuruddha further tells the bhagava that the three of them can remain aloof from sensual pleasures and demeritorious states of mind so that they can achieve jhanas with due diligence they progress along the ariya practice till they pass beyond the plane of neither perception nor non perception and passing that plane enter upon the stopping of perception and sensation and abide in it there through intui tive wisdom they see the utter destruction of all the defile ments beyond that stage they enter upon and dwell in the state of an excellent knowledge and vision that surpasses the dhamma of men and that is befitting the ariyas that he says is an abiding in comfort that excels all other abidings in constrast to anuruddha and his two companions in the noble practice there were alt one time group of way ward bhikkhus in kosambi who were living quarrelsome life wounding one another with the weapon of the tongue lit ‘using the spears of words’ xvi introduction the buddha reproached the bhikkhus and admonished them he told them of six things to be remembered that make for affection for respect that are conducive to concord har mony and unity thus bhikkhu should offer his companions in the noble practice friendly act of body both in public and in private he should offer them friendly act of speech both he should offer them an act of thought both in public and in private whatever acquisitions lawfully acquired should be shared with the companions in the noble practice companions in the noble practice should dwell united in virtuous conduct they should dwel united in ariya views that lead onwards and that promote action for the complete destruction of dukkha both in public and in private of these six points to be well remembered by bhikkhus the bhagava emphasised the importance of the sixth one as the topmost kosambiya sutta it was at the hermitage of the brahman rammaka in savatthi that the buddha related his story of the noble pursuit the quest for deathlessness to group of bhikkhus who were awaiting those expecting to hear talk on dhamma by the buddha the buddha opened his discourse by telling them that there are two pursuits the noble pursuit and the ignoble pursuit the ignoble pursuit is pursuing the course that leads to rebirth with its consequences of ageing disease and death etc by person who is in the nature of being reborn with the consequences of ageing disease and death etc the noble pursuit is pursuing the course that leads to birthlessness with iis consequences of non ageing non disease and deathlessness the incomparable state of safety which is nibbana by introduction xvil person who is himself subject to rebirth and its consequences of ageing disease and death etc after discussion of the above subject the bhagava relates the story of his renunciation and his quest for the ending of sorrow he narrates how he became pupil of alara of kalama and udaka rama’s son and learnt from the two great teachers and gained proficiency in the jhanas leading to the state of akificaifidyatana noth ingness under aldara and the state of nevasafifianasafifiayatana neither perception nor non perception under udaka the two teachers honoured him with teacher’s status with co equal standing but the bodhisatta by his inherent wisdom saw that this dhamma is not for the weariness of life not for non attachment not for cessation of dukkha it was not what he was after he left the two teachers to seek the deathless dhamma on his own he recounts his earnest endeavour to gain enlightenment in uruvela forest his reluctance to preach the dhamma to the world brahma sahampati’s entreaty to teach the truth for the benefit of the sorrowing humanity and then his first sermon to the group of five ascetics at the deer park near baranasi then he admon ishes the bhikkhu audience to keep away from the five strands of sensual pleasures for escaping from the peril of mara the death dealing evil one he exhorts them in these terms “bhikkhus these samanas and brahmanas who enjoy the five kinds of sense pleasure with greed with bewilder ment with strong attachment without seeing the fault and without knowledge of escape should be known thus “they have fallen into misfortune they have fallen into ruin they are subjected to whatever the evil one wishes to do “bhikkhus for instance if deer living in the forest were to fall asleep on heap of snares in which he was caught he should be known thus ‘he has fallen into misfor tune he has fallen into ruin he is subjected to whatever the hunter wishes to do even so those samanas and brahmanas who enjoy the five kinds of sense pleasure with greed without seeing the fault without knowledge of escape would be subjected to mara’s will xviil introduction “bhikkhus for instance if deer living in the forest were to fall asleep on heap of snares in which he was not caught he should be known thus ‘he has not fallen into misfortune he has not fallen into ruin he is not subjected to whatever the hunter wishes to do when the hunter comes he will be able to get away “even so those samanas and brahmanas who enjoy these five kinds of sense pleasure without greed without be wilderment without strong attachment seeing the fault and knowing the way of escape should be known thus “they have not fallen into misfortune they have not fallen into ruin they are not subjected to whatever the evil one wishes to do ’” pasardsi sutta once when the buddha was staying at the jetavana monastery of anathapindika in savatthi he gave discourse to the bhikkhus on how to control the wayward mind bhikkhus bhikkhu striving for higher consciousness leading to insight might be distracted by evil thoughts associ ated with attachment or hatred or bewilderment in such situation he should think of five objects of thought and these are the five bhikkhus just as skilled carpenter might knock out big peg with small peg bhikkhu grappling with evil thought associated with attachment hatred or bewilderment should try and think of some meritorious thought other than the evil thought that has arisen in him in this way he should drive away the evil thought bhikkhus in spite of driving away the evil thoughts by thinking of meritorious thoughts should that bhikkhu still be harassed by evil thoughts he should think of the faults of those evil thoughts just as someone who might find himself loaded with putrid carcass around his neck would feel great disgust with it so also the bhikkhu should investigate the faults that go together with that evil thought in this way he should drive away those evil thoughts introduction xix bhikkhus if in spite of investigating the fault inherent in those evil thoughts that bhikkhu should still be troubled by those evil thoughts he should try to refuse to think of them and forget them completely in this way he will overcome them bhikkhus if in spite of complete forgetting of those evil thoughts that bhikkhu should still be troubled by evil thought he should ponder on the source of those evil thoughts “whence do they arise bhikkhus for the bhikkhu who ponders on the forma tion of evil thoughts at their source those evil thoughts will be driven away bhikkhus if in spite of tracing the source of those evil thoughts those thoughts should still occur to that bhikkhu he should subdue them it is as if strong man were to take hold of weak man by the neck and subdue him and torment him so also that bhikkhu with clenched teeth and his tongue pressed against the roof of the mouth pressure and torment the evil mind with his meritorious mind then those evil thoughts will disappear being thus able to get rid of the evil thoughts the mind of that bhikkhu becomes well established composed and fixed on given object vitakkasanthana sutta the buddha gives his advice to various hearers to suit their mental capacities in the vitakkasanthana sutta he is speaking to bhikkhus striving for higher consciousness leading to insight his advice to laymen is more basic as exemplified in the saleyyaka sutta and the verafijaka sutta which now follow at one time the bhagava was journeying through the country of the kosalans accompanied by large number of bhikkhus when he stopped at brahmin village of sala there the householders of sala went to the bhagava and asked him this question “o gotama some people at their death appear in wretched destination and some people at their death appear in the happy world of the devas may we know the xx introduction cause the reason for the different destinations of different people and the bhagava explained to them thus householders it is because of unjust and uneven action that some beings in this world on the dissolution of their bodies after death appear in the wretched destination in states of ruin in realms of continuous suffering it is because of just and even action that some beings in the world on the disso lution of their bodies after death appear in good destination the happy world of the devas the bhagava then explained further thus householders there are three kinds of unjust and uneven bodily action four kinds of unjust and uneven verbal action and three kinds of unjust and uneven mental action the three kinds of unjust and uneven bodily action mean taking the life of sentient beings intent on doing harm taking other people’s things that are not given with the intention of stealing and indulging in wrongful gratification of sensual pleasures particularly in sexual matters the four kinds of unjust and uneven verbal action mean speaking falsehood knowing it as false making mali cious speech with intent to sow discord among those living in harmony using harsh speech that hurts the hearer and talking frivolously that brings benefit to no one and not connected with dhamma the three kinds of unjust and uneven mental action mean coveting other peoples’ property harbouring malice towards others with wicked intention of wishing them loss or destruction and holding wrong views such as denial of the law of kamma and the consequences of kammic action and of the existence of samanas and brahmanas who are accom plished in the ariya path briefly speaking it is wrong view that rejects the ten kinds of right view these ten kinds of unjust and uneven action are the cause of falling into miserable existences apaya wretched introduction xxi destinations duggati states of ruin vinipata and realms of continuous suffering niraya on the dissolution of the body after death then the three kinds of just and even bodily action are these one restrains from taking life and abstains from destruction of life restrains from taking what is not given and restrains from wrongful gratification of sensual pleasures particularly restraining oneself from unlawful sex with married or unmarried women the four kinds of just and even verbal action are these one restrains from speaking falsehood and never speaks that which one knows to be false restrains from talking mali ciously about all persons never causing dissension and dishar mony among those living in harmony restrains from speaking harshly that hurts the hearer and restrains from talking frivo lously that brings benefit to no one and is not connected with dhamma the three kinds of just and even mental action are these one restrains from covetting other people’s property restrains from harbouring malice towards others with wicked intention of wishing them loss or destruction and restrains from holding wrong view such as the denial of the law of kamma and the consequences of kammic action and of the existence of samanas and brahmanas who are accomplished in the ariya path these ten kinds of just and even mental action are the causes of rebirth in good destination the happy world of the devas the bhagava goes on to say that anyone who lives life marked by these ten ways of just and even action may wish for good destination at his death ranging from glorious human existence to the various planes of deva exist ence and brahma existence and will make an end of all suffering by the exhaustion of all mental impurities the audience all brahmins of sala were so delighted by the discourse that they all became lay disciples of the buddha in xxii introduction verafija sutta another brahmin audience the householders of verafija under similar circumstances heard similar exposi yon and also became disciples of the buddha having given quick sampling of the contents of the book we may say few words regarding our style of trans lating the paji text in modern english in this connection we would reiterate what we had said in the introduction to our first edition of milapannasa quoted below from “introduction to mulapannasa” edited by mpa and published in aes we have not felt obliged to render the same pali word everywhere by the same english word since by exploit ing wide range of english words covering similar area of meaning and association the meaning of the sentence is con veyed more effectively we have exercised the same sort of freedom as regards structure for instance we have felt free to use the active voice where the pali text uses the passive voice and vice versa the same applies to the use of noun phrases and verbs and to grammatical tense when consider ations of english grammar and usage prevail our aim generally has been to produce translation which is as close as possible to the original pali text we have tried to keep little of the flavour of pali if not the flavour of words or tone at least the flavour of modes of thought or modes of exposition may the buddha’s teaching shine forth like the radiant

the mualapariyadya sutta the first in this vagga in some pali texts of this sutta the concluding words are ‘te bhikkhu bhagavato bhasitami abhinandunti’ which means that this discourse was approved by the bhikkhus the above translation is based on the text as approved by the sixth synod the commen tary also explained that the buddha gave this discourse to remove the conceit of the bhikkhus who thought that they understood whatever the bhddha said their conceit was dispelled because they could not understand the above discourse due to their lack of understanding they did not express their appreciation sabbasava sutta discourse on all asavas thus have heard once the bhagava the exalted one was staying at the jetavana monastery of anathapindika in savatthi at that time the bhagava addressed the bhikkhus saying “bhikkhus and they answered him “venerable sir then the bhagava uttered these words “bhikkhus shall expound to you discourse on the restraint of all asavas defilements that befuddle the mind listen well and pay good attention shall speak “very well venerable sir replied the bhikkhus to the bhagava who then delivered this discourse asavas defilements that befuddle the mind they are like liquor long fermented they convey the idea of something flowing out that intoxicates or bemuddles the mind asavas are usually classi fied into four categories kamasava or gross attachment to and craving for the five sense objects ii bhavasava or craving for better existence such as the ripa and arupa planes of existence in the belief that they are permanent stable and constant this craving occurs together with sassata ditthi belief in eternalism iii avijjasava or the defilement of lack of comprehension of the four ariya turths through magga insight iv ditthasava or

mitlapariyaya vagga dhammadayada sutta discourse on dhamma inheritance thus have heard at one time the bhagavad the exalted one was staying at the jetavana monastery of anathapindika in savatthi then the bhagava addressed the bhikkhus saying “‘bhikkhus the bhikkhus replied to the bhagava “venerable sir the bhagava spoke thus bhikkhus be my heirs with regard to the dhamma but not with regard to material requisites out of compassion for you consider “how may my disciples become heirs with regard to the dhamma and not with regard to material requisites should you bhikkhus become heirs with

not heirs with regard to the dhamma if bhikkhus you become my heirs with regard to the dhamma and not heirs with regard to material requisites on account of that you may not become objects of censure and it will be said of you thus “the teacher’s disciples are only heirs with regard to the dhamma and are not heirs with regard to material requisites on account of that too may not be an object of

still have some more left to be thrown away you may eat it if you so desire but if you do not shall now throw it away where there is no green grass growing or drop it into water where no living organisms are present it might thus occur to one of the bhikkhus “the bhagava has had his alms food and he is satisfied quife full quite finished satiated and has had as much as he needed and he still has some more left to be thrown away if we do not eat it the bhagava will now throw it away where there is no green grass growing or drop it into water where no living organisms are present but the bhagava has said ““bhikkhus be my heirs with regard to the dhamma but not with regard to material requisites indeed alms food is one of the items in material requisites had better pass this night and day without eating this alms food in spite of this hunger and weakness thus that bhikkhu might pass that night and day in meditation without cating that alms food in spite of hunger and weakness then this might occur to the second bhikkhu “the bhagava has had his alms food and he is satisfied quite full quite finished satiated and has had as much as he needed and he still has some more left to be thrown away it we do not eat it the bhagava will now throw it away where there is no green grass growing or drop it into water mulapariyaya vagga where no living organisms are present had better eat

bhikkhus even if that second bhikkhu had that alms food appeasing hunger and weakness and thus might pass that night and day he would be blameless however of my two disciples the first bhikkhu is to be more honoured and praised what is the reason for this bhikkhus forgoing that alms food will cause that bhikkhu to be satis fied with little to be contented to lessen defilements to maintain himself easily and to put forth effort for long time therefore bhikkhus be you my heirs with regard to the dhamma and not with regard to material requisites out of compassion for you consider “how may my disciples become heirs with regard to the dhamma and not with regard to material requisites thus spoke the bhagava having spoken thus the sugata rose from his seat and retired to his monastery then not long after the bhagava had left the venerable sariputta addressed the bhikkhus saying rever end bhikkhus those bhikkhus replied “‘ reverend sir to the venerable riputta retired to his monastery thayasana viharam pavisi when the buddha wanted to praise disciple or to bring out the virtues of the dhamma it was his wont to give only brief outline of the discourse and retire to his chamber so

listened ta the dhamma dhammadaydada sutta the venerable sariputta said these words in what way avuso your reverences do disciples not follow the teacher’s example of practising solitary seclu sion

the bhikkhus will bear it in mind in that case avuso your reverences listen and pay good attention shall speak “very well reverend sir replied those bhikkhus to the venerable sariputta who then said thus in what way avuso do disciples not follow the teacher’s example of practising solitary seclusion in this teaching avuso while the teacher abides in solitary seclu sion there are disciples who do not follow his example of practising solitary seclusion they do not give up demeritorious when moot points in the discourse had been thus cleared the buddha praised the bhikkhu who had made the explanation on his ability to bring out the very thoughts and ideas that he the buddha wished his disciple to convey to the bhikkhus present sometimes when the buddha wished to bring out the virtues of the dhamma he retired to his chamber without elaboratig when sariputta would interpose and explain it to the satisfaction of the enquirers here in this sutta the buddha gave only the introductory

appeared when the settled mind had thus become perfectly pure cleansed unsullied uncontaminated malleable ready for application firm and imperturbable directed it towards attainment of savakkhaya fiana the insight which uproots the dsavas knew “this is dukkha’’ as it really is knew knew as it really is the reference here is to penetrative knowledge without confusion of the true nature of all

seeing thus my mind became liberated from kamasava the defilement of sense pleasure bhavasava the defilement of hankering after better existence and avijjasava the defile ment of ignorance of the four ariya truths when the mind was thus liberated there occurred the knowledge “it is liberated ’’ knew rebirth is ended the noble practice of purity has been accomplished what needed to be done for attainment of magga insight has been done nothing else remains to be done for this attainment of magga brahmin in the last part of the night gained this third vijja the insight which uproots savas just as in one who mindfully and strenuously puts forth effort with mind directed to nibbana avijja lack of insight which uproots asavas disappears vijj the insight which uproots dsavas arises darkness disappears and light appears similarly in me avijja disappeared vijja arose darkness disappeared and light appeared brahmin it might occur to you thus ‘samana gotama is up to now resorting to taking up remote forest the extinction of dukkha is nibbana the practice léading to the extinction of dukkha the ariya path of eight constituents asavas befuddling defilements mental intoxicants taints cankers the asavas are rooted in lobha desire craving ditthi false views and moha inability to distinguish what is right or true from what is wrong or false the extinction of dsavas is nibbana bhayabherava sutta or jungle abodes because he is not yet free of attachment anger and bewilderment brahmin you should not think so brahmin see very well these two reasons for resorting to such abodes being able to live without discomfort in the present and out of solicitude for the bhikkhus who come after for these two reasons resort to remote forest or jungle abodes “the revered gotama who like the former bud dhas who are worthy of special veneration who are perfectly self enlightened has indeed great solicitude for the bhikkhus who come after gotama excellent is the dhamma gotama excellent

the pa words used in the text are paccimajanata literally meaning those who come after however the commentary explains this to mean bhikkhus mulapariyadya vagga anangana sutta discourse on taintlessness thus have heard at one time the bhagava was staying at the jetavana monastery of anathapindika in savatthi then the venerable sariputta addressed the bhikkhus saying “reverend bhikkhus

“friends” anadgaga sutta avuso among those four persons of the two types of persons having no mental taint he who has no mental taint and who knows rightly “i have no mental taint in my mind” is said to be superior when this was said the venerable maha moggallana asked the venerable riputta thus “avuso sariputta of the two types of persons having mental taint one is said to be inferior and the

having come to know it to be cause of defilement of the mind when he has got rid of these kilesas then the bhikkhu becomes possessed of unshakable and profound con fidence in the buddha reflecting “thus indeed is the bhagava worthy of special veneration truly comprehending the dhammas by his own intellect and insight possessing penetrative knowledge and perfect course of practice speak ing only what is beneficial and true knowing all the three lokas worlds incomparable in taming those who deserve to be tamed the teacher of devas’ and men the enlightened one knowing and teaching the four ariya truths the most exalted that bhikkhu also becomes possessed of unshakable and profound confidence in the dhamma reflecting ‘the dhamma which is well expounded by the bhagava is person ally apperceivable it is not delayed in its results its truths the three lokas are the animate world satta loka the inanimate world okasa loka and the world of the conditioned sah khara loka milapariyaya vagga can be tested by anyone it is worthy of being perpetually borne in mind and its truths can be realized and experienced by the ariyas individually by their own effort and practice that bhikkhu also becomes possessed of unshakable and profound confidence in the sanigha reflecting “the disciples of the bhagava the sanigna are endowed with the right practice they are endowed with straightforward upright ness in that’they follow the straight middle way they are endowed with right conduct in that their practice is directed to the realization of nibbana they are endowed with correct ness in practice the disciples of the bhagava the sanigha consisting of eight categories or four pairs® of disciples are worthy of offerings brought even from afar are worthy of offerings specially set aside for guests are worthy of offer ings donated for well being in the future existences they are worthy of receiving obeisance they are the incomparable fertile field for all to sow the seeds of merit whatever defilement should be uprooted through particular stage of magga insight that bhikkhu has dis four pairs there are eight categories of disciples namely four attainers of magga fiana and four attainers of phala fiana magga fiana is the flash of insight into nibbana and phala fiaga is the fruition or repeated insight into nibbana and so attainers of magga fiana and phala iana come in pairs hence four pairs the uprooting of kilesas can be viewed in two ways one centeringon on the kilesas and the other centering on the stages of magga insight certain kilesas are entirely uprooted only by particu lar stage of magga insight and other sets of kilesas only by other stages of magga insight the kilesas and the other centering on the stages of magga insight certain kilesas are entirely uprooted only by particular stage of magga insight and other sets of kilesas only by other stages of magga insight denigrating others makkha improper rivalry palasa envy issa stinginess macchariya deceit maya and hypocrisy satheyya these six are entirely uprooted by sotapatti magga the first stage of magga insight attained by stream enterer the remaining kilesas are aban doned by him to certain extent but not entirely uprooted these remaining ten kilesas are abandoned to greater extent but not entirely uprooted by sakadagami once returner who has attained vattha sutta carded it has thrown it up has let go of it has abandoned it and has renounced it reflecting ‘i am ‘endowed with unshakeable and profound confidence in the buddha he understands lit gets the

abhijjha and unrighteous greed visamalobha counted as one umit since both spring from greed obduracy thamha dispar aging others sarambha conceit mana arrogance atimana and vanity mada these six are entirely uprooted by arahatta magga the final stage of magga insight that of an arahat thus all kilesas are entirely uprooted at this stage gi mulapatiyaya vagga tranquil with mind dnd body thus tranquil he experiences happiness with happiness his mind becomes concentrated bhikkhus even if that bhikkhu of such morality of such concentration and of such understanding takes alms food consisting of excellent rice free of black grains with various knids of curries of meat and vegetables that taking of such food will be no danger to the attainment of magga insight and fruition for him bhikkhus just as stained and dirty cloth becomes pure and bright when washed in lit on account of clear water or just as gold becomes pure and bright when placed in lit on account of goldsmith’s crucible even so bhikkhus there can be no danger in the form of obstacles to magga insight and fruition for that bhikkhu of such morality of such concentration and of such understanding even though he takes alms food consisting of excellent rice free of black grains with various kinds of curries of meat and vegetables he abides with mind filled with goodwill metta that permeates quarter likewise second quarter likewise third quarter likewise fourth quarter in the same manner identifying himself with all beings everywhere above below and across he abides with mind filled with good will metta that extends to all beings in the world and that is extensive lofty measureless peaceable and without malice he abides with mind filled with compassion with sympathetic joy with equanimity that permeates quarter likewise second quarter likewise third quarter for bhikkhu who is endowed with the morality the concentration and the understanding of an anagami one who has attained the third stage of magga insight the eating of excellent alms food will pose no danger and will be no obstacle to the continuance of andgami magga and to the attainment of the final stage arahatta magga and arahatta phala or to the practice of insight meditation vipassana for achiev ing such attainment vattha sutta likewise fourth quarter in the same manner identifying himself with all beings everywhere above below and across he abides with mind filled with equanimity that extends to all beings in the world and that is extensive lofty measureless peaceable and without malice he understands there is this complex of the aggregates of mind and body there is what is ignoble de sire and greed there is what is excellent ariya magga insight there is emancipation nibbana which surpasses this mind the jhana of brahmavihara the four sublime states of meditation the mind of that bhikkhu who thus knows ‘and sees is liberated from the defilement of sense pleasure from the defilement of hankering after better existence and from the defilement of ignorance when the mind is thus liberated there occurs the knowledge “it is liberated he understands ‘rebirth is ended the noble practice of purity has been accomplished what needed to be done for the attainment of magga insight has been done nothing else remains to be done for this attainment of magga insight bhikkhus this bhikkhu is called bhikkhu who has washed himself by washing his mind clean of defilements with magga insight at that time the brahmin sundarikabharadvaja was sitting not far from the bhagava ‘then the brahmin sundarikabharadvaja asked the bhagava does the honourable gotama go to the river bahuka to bathe brahmin why should one go to the river bahuka what good can the river bahuka do there is this mind and body such knowledge is the knowledge of the truth of dukkha this means discernment of desire and greed lobha as the root cause of dukkha this is the knowledge of the truth of the cause of dukkha described in para mulapariyaya vagga honourable gotama bathing in the river bahuka is considered by many people to be means of cleansing themselves of defilements it is also considered by them to be meritorious action and many people wash the evil deeds done by them down the river bahuka then the bhagava spoke to the brahmin sundari kabharadvaja in verse though the foolish man may con stantly plunge into the waters of the river bahuka or of adhikakka or of gaya bath ing places or of the river sundarika or of the river sarassati or of payaga bathing place or of the river bahumati he who has done black deeds cannot get cleansed what can the river sundarika do what can the payaga bathing place do and what can the river bahuka do they can not wash that brutal evil doer clean of dan ger from the results of his evil deeds for him who is pure being devoid of defilements every day is indeed as aus picious as the day of conjunction with the constellation phagguni he who is pure keeps the sabbath always he who is pure and who performs good deeds always fulfils moral duties brahmin purify yourself only in this sasana teaching and render all beings secure from danger if you do not speak falsehood do not take life and do not take what is not given if you have faith and are not avari cious what need is there to go to gaya bathing place to bathe well is for you as good as the gaya bathing place vattha sutta when this was said the brahmin sundari kabharadvaja addressed the bhagava thus gtama excellent is the dhamma gotama excellent is the dhamma just as gotama one has turned up what lies upside down just as one has uncoevered what lies covered just as one shows the way to another who is lost just as one holds up lamp in the darkness for those with eyes to see visible objects even so has the revered gotama revealed the dhamma to me in various ways take refuge in the revered gotama take refuge in the dhamma take refuge in the sanigha may be initiated into the order in the presence of the revered gotama and may receive full admission into the order the brahmin sundarikabharadvaja was initiated into the order in the presence of the bhagava and later received the full admission as bhikkhu not long after he became bhikkhu the venerable bharadvaja dwelling alone and in seclusion vigilant and diligent directed his mind to nibbana and soon by realizing himself in this very life through magga insight abhifiia he attained and abided in the fruits of the noblest and most supreme arahatship which is the ultimate goal of the noble practice and for which worthy men rightly renounce hearth and home to lead the homeless life he knew well “rebirth is ended the noble practice of purity has been accomplished what needed to be done for the attainment of magga insight has been done nothing else remains to be done for this attainment of magga in sight and so the venerable bharadvaja became one among the arahats end of the vattha sutta the seventh in this vagga mulapariyaya vagga sallekha sutta discourse on obliteration of defilement thus have heard at one time the bhagava was staying at the jetavana monas tery of anathapindika in savatthi then in the evening the venerable mahacunda rose from meditation in seclusion ap proached the bhagava and having paid obeisance to him sat in suitable place and he addressed the bhagava thus “venerable sir in the world there are those various wrong views connected with the doctrine of atta self or the doctrine of loka the world of phenomena venerable sir can there be abandonment and relinquishment of those views even at the beginning of insight meditation lit attention by bhikkhu cunda in the world there are those various wrong views connected with the doctrine of atta self or the doc trine of loka wherever those wrong views arise wherever they persist and wherever they develop there is abandonment and relinquishment of these wrong views by one who sees the khandha aggregates fundamentally and truly with right understanding thus ‘this the five khandha aggregates is not mine this is not this is not my atta self the beginning attainment of the first insight in vipassana insight ‘meditation wherever yattha lit where by this is meant the five khandha aggregates of mind and body the wrong views arise persist and develop in the five khandha aggregates and they are manifested in action and speech right understanding understanding gained through vipassana in sight leading to sotapatti magga the first stage of magga insight sallekha sutta cunda in this matter some bhikkhu being detached from sensual pleasures and demeritorious factors may achieve and remain in the first jhana which has vitakka initial application of the mind vicadra sustained applicaion of the mind and which has piti delightful satisfaction and sukha bliss born of detachment from the hindrances nivaranas there is this possibility that bhikkhu might think ‘i abide in obliteration of kilesa defilements but cunda in the ariyan teaching these jhanas are not called states of obliteration of kilesas in the ariyan teaching they are called states of abiding in present bliss cunda in this matter some bhikkhu having got rid of

what venerable sariputta said the bhikkhus accepted it with de light end of the sammaditthi sutta the ninth in this vagga mahasatipatthana sutta great discourse steadfast mindfulness thus have heard the bhagava was at one time residing at the market town called kammasadhamma in the kuru country there the bhagava addressed the bhikkhus saying “o bhikkhus” and they replied to him “venerable sir the bhagava said summary bhikkhus this is the one and only way for the purification of the minds of beings for overcoming sorrow and lamentation for the complete destruction of physical pain and‘ mental

of the summary perception of the true nature of the body section on breathing bhikkhus how does the bhikkhu keep his mind steadfastly on the body bhikkhus the bhikkhu following the practice of my teaching having gone to the forest or to the foot of tree or to an empty solitary place sits down cross legged keep ing his body’ erect and sets up mindfulness orienting it towards the object of concentration then with entire mindfulness he breathes in and with entire mindfulness he breathes out breathing in long inhalation he is conscious of breathing in long inhalation or breathing out long exhalation he is conscious of breathing out long exhalation breathing in short inhalation he is conscious of breathing in short inhalation or breathing out short exhalation he is conscious of breathing out short exhalation he trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the in coming breath at its beginning its middle and at its end he dhamma the five dhammas consisting of five nivaraqas five khandhas twelve ayatnas seven bojjhangas and four ariya saccas this will become clear in paras to of this sutta mahdsatipat hana sutta trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the out going breath at its beginning its middle and at its end by being fully conscious of the inhalation he trains himself to calm down the strong inhalation as he breathes in by being fully conscious of the exhalation he trains himself to calm down the strong exhalation as he breathes out’ just as bhikkhus skilful turner or turner’s appren tice knows long pull on the string turning the lathe when long pull is made or knows short pull when’‘a short pull is made even so bhikkhus the bhikkhu breathing in long inhalation is conscious of breathing in long inhalation or breathing out long exhalation is conscious of breathing out ‘a long exhalation or breathing in short inhalation is con scious of breathing in short inhalation or breathing out short exhalation is conscious of breathing out short exhala tion he trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the in coming breath at its beginning its middle and at its end he trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the out going breath at its beginning its middle and at its end he trains himself to calm down the strong inhalation as he breathes in he trains himself to calm down the strong exhalation as he breathes out thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his own breathing and perceives its impermanent insecure and soulless nature occasionally he realizes that the aggregate of physical pheriomena which is the breathing of others must be of similar nature because of their realization he can be said to kedép his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phe nomena which is the breathing of others in this way he is no special effort is necessary to calm down the strong inhalation and exhalation the more one gets mental concentration the more the strong inhalation and exhalation will calm down when the mental concentration reaches its highest point inhalation and exhalation will become so delicate that the yogi will feel that his breathing has stopped mulapariyaya vagga considered to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his own breathing or which is ‘that of others when he gains more concentration he per ceives the cause and the actual appearing of the aggregate of physical phenomena which is the process of breathing he also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena which is the process of breathing he also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenom

wrong views without clinging to any of the five khandhas that are continuously deteriorating bhikkhus it is in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body perceiving its true nature end of the section on breathing perception of the true nature of the body section on body movement and posture and again bhikkhus the bhikkhu when waiking is conscious of walking or when standing he is conscious of standing or when sitting he is conscious of sitting or when lying down he is conscious of lying down or in whatever movement or posture his body is he is conscious of it thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his body and perceives its impermanent insecure soulless and repulsive nature occa sionally he realizes that the aggregate of physical phenom ena which is the body of others must be of similar nature because of this realization he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physicial phenomena

mahdsatipat hana sutta the body of others in this way he is considered to keep his mind steadfastly physical pohenomena which is his own body or which is that of others when he gains more concentra

is the causes of appearing of physical phenomena are ignorance of the four ariya truths craving kamma and nutriment they and their effect the continuous appearance of physical phenomena are called five samudaya dhamma the perception of these five samudaya dhamma is called samudhaya dhammanupassi they are perceived in the following way when the bhikkhu can steadfastly keep his mind on the body postures by means of diligence mindfulness concentration compre hension he perceives the sign or incessant appearance of physical phenomena nibbatti lakkhana this perception usually begins when the bhikkhu achieves the second vipassana fana paccaya pariggaha fiana from this perception the bhikkhu draws the conclusion that rebirths of beings take place in similar way therefore while the bhikkhu is perceiving the continous appearance of physical phenomena he realizes that endless rebirths are due to ignorance of four ariya truths craving for pleasure of the senses kamma deeds words and thoughts which has the potency for rebirth as its effect nutriment which is essential for physical phenomena mind citta which is the motivating force heat and cold the causes of dissolution of physical phenomena are the absence of the above factors the bhikkhu then realizes that extinction ‘of ignorance of four ariya truths will cause the extinction of endless appearance of physical phenomena the actual perception of the sign of change or disappearance or deterioration of physical phenomena will begin when the bhikkhu achieves the third vipassana fnaga sammasana fidna the sign of change is called viparindma lakkhana in fact the perception of the appearance and disappearance of physical phenomena by means of nibbattt and viparinama lakkhaga be comes clearer when the bhikkhu achieves the fourth vipassana fidana udayabbaya fidna however the perception of only the dis appearance of physical phenomena becomes stronger when he achieves the fifth vipassana fana bhatiga aga mulapariyaya sutta firmly mindful of the fact that there is only the aggregate of ‘physical phenomena without soul or atta directing it that mindfulness is solely for gaining vipassana insights

does so with clear comprehension in bending and in stretching his limbs he does so with clear comprehension in carrying or wearing the great robe alms bow and the other two robes he does so with clear comprehension in eating drinking chewing and savouring he does so with clear comprehension in this shows the mental state of the bhikkhu when his mindfulness is at its height before he reaches this mental state he occasionally imagines in spite of his efforts to be mindful that body and limbs are his that his jiva soul or atta is directing them to make postures occasionally he even feels proud of and pleased with “his” body and limbs these false views of the body and limbs begin to disappear when he achieves the fifth vipassana fiana bhaiga ana from that stage the bhikkhu perceives only the deterioration of the body and he is no longer conscious of the body and the limbs as such and therefore he does not take pride and pleasure in them with this perception of the non existence of the body and limbs he fully achieves the eleventh vipassana na sadkharupekkha nana mahdsatipat hana sutta defecating and urinating he does so with clear comprehen sion in walking standing sitting falling

to grow to make them develop in full in samatha vipassana meditation this bhikkhus called right effort and bhikkhus what is right mindfulness bhikkhus the bhikkhu the disciple following my teaching keeps his mind steadfastly on the body kaya with diligence comprehension and mindfu ss and perceives its impermanent insecure soulless and repulsive nature thus keeping away covetousness and distress which will appear if he is not mindful of the five khandhas the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on sensation vedana with diligence comprehension and mindtulness and perceives its impermanent insecure and soulless nature thus keeping away covetousness and distress which will appear if he is not mindful of the five khandhas the bhikkhu concentrates steadfastly on the mind citta with diligence comprehension and mindfulness and perceives its impermanent insecure and soulless nature thus keeping away covetousness and distress which will appear if he is not mindful of the five khandhas the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the dhamma with diligence comprehension and mindfulness and per ceives their impermanent insecure and soulless nature thus mahdsatipat hana “sutta keeping away covetousness and distress which will appear if he is not mindful of the five khandhas this bhikkhus is called right mindfulness and bhikkhus what is right concentration bhikkhus the bhikkhu who follows my teaching being detached from sensual pleasures and demeritorious factors achieves and remains in the first jhana which has vitakka initial applicationof the mind vicara sustained application of themind piti delightful satisfaction and sukha bliss barn of detach ment from the hindrances nivaranas having got rid of vitakka and vicara the bhikkhu achieves and remains in the second jhana with internal tranquillity with enhancement of one pointedness of concen tration devoid of vitakka and vicara but with piti and sukha born of concentration having been detached from piti that bhikkhu dwells in equanimity with mindfulness and clear comprehension and experiences sukha in mind and body he achieves and remains in the third jhana that which causes person who attains it to be praised by the noble ones as one who has equanimity and mindfulness one who abides in sukha by dispelling both pain and pleasure and by the previous disappearance of sadness and gladness that bhikkhu achieves and remains in the fourth jhanaa’ state of equanimity and absolute purity of mindfulness without pain or pleasure this bhikkhus is called right concentration bhikkhus this is called the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of dukktia thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the dhamma in himself and perceives that they are just phenomena with out any entity or soul occasionally he realizes that the dhamma in others must be of similar nature because of this realization he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on the dhamma in others in this way he is considered to mulapariyaya vagga keep his mind steadfastly on the dhamma in himself or in others when he gains more concentration he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of the dhamma he also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the dhamma he also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of the dhamméa with their causes and further the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there are only dhamma that mindfulness is solely for gaining vipassana insights progressively solely for gaining further mindfulness stage by stage the bhikkhu remains detached “from craving and wrong views without clinging to any of the five khandhas that are continously deteriorating bhikkhus it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the four noble truths perceiving their true nature end of the section on the noble truths end of perception of the true nature of dhamma” indeed bhikkhus whosoever practises these four methods of steadfast mindfulness in this manner for seven years one of two results is to be certainly expected in him arahatship anfia the knowledge of final emancipation arahatta phala in this very existence or if there yet be any trace of clinging left the state of an anagami the state of non return to the world of sense existence anagami phala let alone seven years bhikkhus whosoever practises these four methods of steadfast mindfulness in this manner for six years for five years for four years for three years for two years for one year let alone one year bhikkhus whosoever practises these four methods of steadfast mindfulness in this manner for seven months one of two results is to be certainly expected in him arahatship in this very existence or if there yet be any trace of clinging left the state of an anagami let alone seven months bhikkhus whosoever prac tises these four methods of steadfast mindfulness in this mahdasatipatthana sutta manner for six months for five months for four months for three months for two months for one month for half month let alone half month bhikkhus whosoever practises these four methods of steadfast mindfulness in this manner for seven days one of two results is to be certainly expected in him arahatship in this very existence or if there yet be any trace of clinging left the state of an anagami because of these beneficial results have de clared at the beginning thus “bhikkhus this is the one and only way for the purification of the minds of beings for overcoming sorrow and lamentation for the complete destruc tion of physical pain and mental distress for attainment of the noble ariya magga and for the realization of nibbana that only way is the practice of the four methods of steadfast mindfulness statipatthana thus spoke the

years would pass away at the end of hundred years and yet sariputta verily the tathagata’s wis dom would suffer no change in acuity even when riputta would have to be carried in litter mahdsihandda sutta sariputta whoever wishing to speak rightly should say rightly of me thus “a being not subject to bewilder ment has arisen in this world for the welfare and happiness of many people out of compassion for the world wealfare for the benefit and happiness of devas and men” he should say rightly of me thus “a being not subject to bewilderment has arisen in this world for the welfare and happiness of many people out of compassion for the world for the welfare benefit and happiness of devas and men at that time the venerable nagasamaéala was sitting behind the bhagava fanning him the venerable nagasamala said to the bhagava thus “wonderful vener able sir marvellous venerable sir on hearing this dis course venerable sir my hair stood on end what is the name of this discourse that being so you nagasamala may bear this dis course in mind as “the hair raising discourse thus said the bhagava delighted the venerable nagasamala rejoiced in what the bhagava had said end of mahasihanada sutta the second in this vagga gi sthandada vagga mahadukkhakkhandha sutta the longer discourse on the mass of dukkha thus have heard at one time the bhagava was staying at the jetavana monastery of anathapindika in savatthi then in the morn ing many bhikkhus having rerobed themselves and carrying alms bowls and great robes made their rounds for alms food in savatthi then it occurred to those bhikkhus it is too early to go on the rounds for alms food it were better that we approach the place of the wandering ascetics paribbajakas who hold alien views then those bhikkhus approached the place of the wan dering ascetics holding alien views and having approached there they exchanged friendly greetings with them having concluded the felicitous and memorable conversation they sat in suitable place then the wandering ascetics holding alien views spoke to them who were thus sitting friends samana gotama declares the knowledge that transcends sense pleasures and so do we also declare the knowledge that transcends sense pleasures friends samana gotama declares the knowledge that transcends corporeality and so do we also declare the knowledge that transcends corporeality friends samana gotama declares the knowledge that transcends sensation and so do we also declare the knowledge that transcends sensation friends in this matter what is the distinction what the superiority and what the difference between samana gotama and us in teaching as against teaching and in instruction as against instruction of the dhamma ”’ then those bhikkhus neither expressed approval nor dis sent regarding what the wandering ascetics holding alien ‘iews had said having expressed neither approval nor dis ent having arisen from their seats they departed thinking mahadukkhakkhandha sutta “we shall learn the meaning of these words in the presence of the bhagava then those bhikkhus having made their rounds for alms food having had their meal having returned from the rounds approached the bhagava having approached and having done their obeisance to him sat in suitable place having sat in suitable place those bhikkhus said to the bhagava these words “venerable sir in the morning we having rerobed ourselves and carrying alms bowl and great robe entered savatthi for alms food then venerable sir it occurred to us “it is too early to go on the rounds for alms food in savatthi it were better that we approach the place of the wandering ascetics who hold alien views”’ then venerable sir we approached the place of the wandering ascetics and having approached ‘there exchanged friendly greetings with them and having concluded the felici tous and memorable conversation we sat in suitable place then venerable sir the wandering ascetics holding alien views spoke to us who were thus sitting “friends samana gotama declares knowledge that transcends sense pleasures and so do we also declare the knowledge that transcends sense pleasures ‘riends samana gotama declares the knowl edge that transcends corporeality and so do we also declare the knowledge that transcends corporeality friends samana gotama declares the knowledge that transcends sensation and so do we also declare the knowledge that transcends sensa tion friends in this matter what the distinction what the superiority and what the difference between samana gotama and us in teaching as against teaching and in instruction as against instruction of the dhamma then venerable sir we expressed neither approval nor dissent regarding what the wandering ascetics holding alien views had said having expressed neither approval nor dis sent having risen from our seats we departed thinking “we ii sthanada vagga shall learn the meaning of those words in the presence of the bhagava bhikkhus the wadering ascetics holding alien views who spoke thus should be asked friends what is the enjoyableness of sense pleasures what are their faults what is the escape from them what is the enjoyableness of corporeality what are their faults what is the escape from them what is the enjoyableness of sensations what are their fault what is the escape from them bhikkhus when thus asked the wandering ascetics hold ing alien views will not be able to give full answer but they will become greatly distressed why is it so it is because such questions are beyond the range of their knowledge bhikkhus see no one in the world comprising devas maras and brahmas and amongst beings comprising samanas brahmanas kings sammutideva and men who can satisfy the mind with answers to these questions except the tathagata or the tathagata’s disciple or one who has heard from this teaching bhikkhus what is the enjoyableness of sense pleasures bhikkhus there are five kinds of sense pleasures and what are the

bhikkhus bhikkhu having got rid of vitakka and vicara achieves and remains in the second jhana with internal tranquillity with enhancement of one pointedness of mind devoid of vitakka and vicara but with piti and sukha born of concentration and then bhikkhus when bhikkhu having been de tached from piti as well dwells in equanimity with mindful ness and clear comprehension experiences sukha in mind and body and achieves and remains in the third jhana for which the ariyas praise him as one who abides in happiness possessed of equanimity and mindfulness and then bhikkhu when bhikkhu by

bhagava had said end of mahadukkhakkhandha sutta the third in this vagga ii sihanada vagga coladukkhakkhandha sutta the shorter discourse on the mass of dukkha thus have heard at one time the bhagava was staying at the nigrodharama monastery in kapilavatthu in the kingdom of the sakyans then mahanama sakyan prince approached the bhagava and having made his obeisance to the bhagavad sat in suitable place and addressed the bhagava thus “venerable sir for quite long time have known the dhamma taught by the bhagava thus ‘greed lobha is an impurity of the mind anger dosa is an impurity of the mind bewilderment moha is an impurity of the mind but al though khow the dhamma taught by the bhagava thus greed lobha is an impurity of the mind anger dosa is an impurity of the mind bewilderment moha is an impurity of the mind sometimes factors of greed take complete hold of my mind and overpower it factors of anger take complete hold of my mind and overpower it and factors of bewilder ment take complete hold of my mind and overpower it then venerable sir it occurs to me thus what have not dispelled from within myself which sometimes makes factors of greed anger and bewilderment take complete hold of my mind and overpower it nigrodharama monastery when the buddha came to kapilavatthu nigrodha sakyan prince donated monastery built in his park to honour the buddha that monastery went by the name of nigro dharama mahanama was already sakadagami the commentary mahanama was under the impression that he had got rid of greed anger and bewilderment totally with sakadagdmi magga but he also knew that he had some kilesas defilements which he had not been able to dispel it also occurred to him that because of kilesas which he had not yet dispelled the very kilesas he thought he had dispelled arise in him again sometimes so he addressed the buddha on this subject wi culadukkhakkhandha sutta mahandma indeed from within yourself you have still not got rid of factors greed anger and bewilderment and therefore these sometimes take complete hold of your mind and overpower it mahanadma if from within yourself you have got rid of those factors you would not be leading householder’s life and you would not be enjoying the plea sures of the senses mahandma it is because you have not got rid of those factors you lead householder’s life and enjoy the pleasures of the senses mahanama even if an ariya disciple has properly seen fundamentally and really and with right knowledge‘ that ‘there is little enjoyment in sense pleasures which are ‘fraught with manifold dukkha with much tribulation and are full of faults he would not be one who does not advert back® to pleasures of the senses unless having detached himself from sense pleasures and demeritorious factors he attains the first and second jhanas of piti delightful satis faction and sukha bliss or the more tranquil other higher jhanas or the two higher magga insights mahanama if however an ariya disciple has properly seen fundamentally and really and with right knowledge that “there is little enjoyment in sense pleasures which are fraught with manifold dukkha with much tribulation and are full of faults and also if having de tached himself from sense pleasures and demeritorious factors right knowledge vipassana insight and the two lower magga insights namely sotapattimagga and sakadagamimagga sense pleasures kama the objects of desire such as visible object sound smell taste and physical contact are called vatthukama while chanda desire and raga attachment are called kilesakama both the objective and subjective aspects are meant here advert back those who have realized only sotapattimagga and sakadagamimagga if they have not attained any jhana are prone to turn their minds back to sense pleasures demeritorious factors here the five nivaranas hindrances or the remaining four if sease desire is taken separately are meant ii sthanada vagga he attains the jhanas of piti and sukha or the more tranquil other higher jhanas or the two higher magga insights he wouid not be one who adverts back to the pleasures of the senses mahanama when was only bodhisatta before hav ing penetrating knowledge of the four ariya truths and not yet buddha too saw properly fundamentally and with right knowledge® that ‘there is little enjoyment in sense pleasures which are fraught with manifold dukkha with much tribulation and are full of faults but never acknowledged myself as one who would not advert back to pleasures of the senses for so long as had not attained the jhanas of piti and sukha after having detached myself from sense nleasures and demeritorious factors or the more tranquil wher higher jhanas or magga insights however mahanama when prop erly saw fundamentally and with right knowledge that there is little enjoyment in sense pleasures which are fraught with manifold dkukkha with much tribulation and are full of faults and when having detached myself from sense plea sures and demeritorious factors attained the jhanas of piti and sukha or the more tranquil other higher jhanas and magga insights only then acknowledged myself as one who would not advert back to the pleasures of the senses mahanama what is the enjoyableness of sense pleasures mahanama there are five kinds of sense plea sures and what are the five they are visible object cogni zable by eye consciousness desirable delightful pleasing alluring accompanied by sensual attachment and enticing sound cognizable by ear consciousness smell cognizable by nose consciousness taste cognizable by tongue con

near rajagaha at that time many niganthas followers of najaputtanigantha who were on the black rock situated on the slopes of mount isigili refrained from sitting down and kept standing continuously they suffered acutely pain fully severely sharply and bitterly then rose from medi tation in solitude in the evening and approached those niganthas on the black rock on the slopes of mount isigili and said “friend niganthas why are you subjecting yourselves to acutc painful severe sharp and bitter suffering by refraining from sitting down and by standing continuously mahanama when said this they replied friend the nigantha known as nataputta knows all and sees all he professes complete possession of knowledge and vision say ing that knowledge and vision abide with him always while walking standing sleeping or waking he has said ‘niganthas past evil kamma actions do exist destroy those evil kamma actions with the practice of the severities which are difficult of execution control of body control of speech and control of thought by this practice here in this existence means not doing evil kamma actions in the future existences thus by annihilation the old evil kamma actions through tormenting ascelic practice and by not doing fresh kammaz actions there will be no further effect in the future existences having no further effect in the future existences kammia actions will become exhausted with the exhaustion of kammaz actions dukkha will become extinct with the extinction of dukkha sensation will become extinct with the extinction of sensa tion all dukkha will be destroyed we appreciate these words and are pleased and delighted with them mahanama when this was said asked the niganthas “friend niganthas do you know thus we existed in the past it is not that we did not they replied “friend we know not ”° again asked “friend niganthas do you know ii sthanada vagga thus ‘we did evil kamma actions in the past existences it is not that we did not do them they replied “friend we know not again asked them “friend niganthas do you know thus ‘we have done such and such evil kamma actions they replied friend we know not again asked them “friend niganthas do you know thus “that much of dukkha has been destroyed and this much of dukkha remains to be destroyed if this much of dukkha is destroyed all dukkha will be destroyed they replied “friend we know not again asked them friend niganthas do you know the disappearance of demeritorious factors and the fulfilment of meritorious factors in this very life’ they replied friend we know not “friend niganthas you do not know thus ‘we existed in the past it is not that we did not you do not know thus ‘we did evil kamma actions in the past it is not that we did not do them you do not know thus ‘we have done such and such evil kamma actions you do not know thus ‘that much of dukkha has been destroyed and this much of dukkha remains to be destroyed if this much of dukkha is destroyed all dukkha will be destroyed you do not know the disappearance of demeritorious factors and the fulfilment of meritorious factors in this very life friend niganthas if that be so it appears that those who had been brutal bloody handed and cruel in livelihood in the world when they are reborn as human beings become ascetics in the order of niganthas ‘friend gotama happiness cannot be achieved through happiness it can only be achieved through pain friend gotama if happiness is achieved through happiness king seniya bimbisara of magadha should have happiness king seniya bimbisara of magadha should be living in greater happiness than the venerable gotama” cufadukkhakkhandha sutta “the venerable niganthas have definitely hastily and without due reflection said ‘friend gotama happiness can not be achieved through happiness it can only be achieved through pain friend gotama if happiness is achieved through happiness king seniya bimbisara of magadha should have happiness king seniya bimbisara of magadha should be living in greater happiness than the venerable gotama’ in fact in this respect it is who should be asked who lives in greater happiness king seniya bimbisara of magadha or the venerable gotama “friend gotama we have definitely hastily and without due reflection said ‘friend gotama happiness cannot be achieved through happiness it can only be achieved through pain friend gotama if happiness is achieved through happi ness king seniya bimbisara of magadha should have happi ness king seniya bimbisara of magadha should be living in greater happiness than the venerable gotama’ but

you may reply as you wish freind niganthas what do you think of this is king seniya bimbisara of magadha able to live in the enjoyment of nothing but happines for seven nights and days without moving his body or uttering word “no friend he is not “friend niganthas what do you think of this is king seniya bimbisara of magadha able to live without moving his body or uttering word for six nights and six days for five nights and five days for four nights and four days for three nights and three days for two nights and two days for one night and one day in the enjoyment of nothing but happiness ii

nights and six days for seven nights and seven days in the enjoyment of nothing but happiness friend niganthas what do you think of this this being so who lives in the enjoyment of greater happines

those bhikkhus answered the bhagava saying “venerable sir the bhagava spoke thus bhikkhus in this teaching there is indeed no possibil ity for any bhikkhu who has not got rid of the five obstruc tions in the mind and who has not cut off the five bondages of the mind to achieve progress through moral purity development through magga insight and fullness of attainment through realization of nibb na

person remains undecided as to whether the teacher is really buddha iw cetokhila sutta clarity® concerning the teacher bhikkhus the mind of the bhikkhu who is doubtful perplexed uncertain and unclear concerning the teacher is not directed to exertion repeated exertion continued exertion and strenuous exertion to gain concentration of mind thus the first obstruction in the mind is not got rid of by that bhikkhu as his mind is not directed to exertion repeated exertion continued exertion and strenu ous exertion and again bhikkhus the bhikkhu has doubt perplexity uncertainty and lack of clarity concerning the dhamma thus the second obstruction in the mind is not got rid of by that bhikkhu and again bhikkhus the bhikkhu has doubt perplexity uncertainty and lack of clarity concerning the samgha thus the third obstruction in the mind is not got rid of by that bhikkhu and again bhikkhus the bhikkhu has doubt perplexity uncertainty and lack of clarity concerning the practice of training oneself bhikkhus the mind of the bhikkhu who lack of clarity not being reassured not being clear or confident in the mind duobt etc concerning the dhamma doubt etc as to the true existence of the three pitakas the five nikayas and the texts of the dhamma this is being doubtful about pariyatti dhamma ii doubt about insight meditation leading progressively to magga phala and nibbana this is

oneself sikkha lit study training discipline practice of higher morality practice of higher concentration and practice of higher insight wisdom to feel doubt ful about these is to feel doubtful about the practice of training oneself according to the dhamma gi sthanada vagga is doubtful perplexed uncertain and unclear concerning the practice of training oneself is not directed to exertion repeated exertion continued exertion and strenuous exertion to gain concentration of mind thus the fourth obstruction in the mind is not got rid of by that bhikkhu as his mind is not directed to exertion repeated exertion continued exertion and strenuous exertion and again bhikkhus the bhikkhu is angry displeased sore at heart and fractious with his companions in the practice of the dhamma bhikkhus the mind of the bhikkhu who is angry displeased sore at heart and fractious with his companions in the practice of the dhamma is not directed to exertion repeated exertion continued exertion and strenuous exertion to gain concentration of mind thus the fifth obstruction in the mind is not got rid of by that bhikkhu as his mind is not directed to exertion repeated exertion continued exertion and strenuous exertion these are the five obstructions in the mind of the bhikkhu which are not got rid of what are the five bondages of the mind which that bhikkhu has not cut off bhikkhus bhikkhu in this sasana is not free from attachment to sense pleasures from desire for sense pleasures from love of sense pleasures from thirst for sense pleasures from the burning pain of sense pleasures and from craving for sense pleasures bhikkhus the mind of the bhikkhu who is not free from attachment from desire from love from thirst from burning pain and from craving for sense pleasures is not directed to exertion repeated exertion continued exertion and strenuous exertion to gain concentration of mind thus the first bondage is not cut off from the mind of that bhikkhu as his mind is not

not cut off from the mind of that bhikkhu attachment to his own body thus the second bondage is not cut off from the mind of that bhikkhu and again bhikkhus the bhikkhu is not free from attach ment to external forms thus the third bondage is not cut off from the mind of that bhikkhu and again bhikkhus the bhikkhu having eaten as much as he wanted till his hunger is satisfied lives addicted to the

he develops basis of psychic power characterized by concentration of inves tigative knowledge vimamnisa and right exertion these make five with strenuous exertion as the fifth factor bhikkhus if bhikkhu is thus endowed with the fifteen factors including strenuous exertion he should certainly be able to destroy kilesas defilements by means of insight knowledge should certainly be able to attain the four magga insights and should certainly be able to gain the incomparable arahatta phala in which the four yogas bonds of attachment come to cessation ”° bhikkhus for example hen lays eight or ten or dozen eggs she sits on them well she gives them sufficient body warmth and suffuses her body odour all around them even though the hen may not wishfully think thus ‘it will be good if these chicks hatch psychic power jddhi iddhi in its original sense is successful accomplishment or fulfilment when one strives after jhana magga insight and phala fruition and brings the task to successful end one is said to have achieved iddhi the basis of this iddhi is concentration and effort which must be cultivated lit endowed with strenuous exertion ussofai exertion applicable to all forms of striving especially striving to bring the arising of meritorious conditions that have not yet arisen and to augment those that have already arisen this exertion is categorized as the fifth factor the five obstructions in the mind that have been got rid of ii the five bondages of the mind that have been cut off iii the five factors consisting of the four bases of psychic power and strenuous exertion as the fifth factor yogakkhemassa adhigamaya lit to reach the shelter of uttermost safety from bondage cetokhila sutta safely by breaking the egg shells with the points of their claws and beaks those chicks should certainly be able to hatch safely by breaking the egg shells with the points of their claws and beaks in the same way the bhikkhu endowed with the fifteen factors including strenuous exertion should certainly be able to destroy kilesas defilements by means of insight knowledge should certainly be able to attain the four magga insights and should certainly be able to gain the incomparable arahatta phala in which the four yogas bonds of attachment come to cessa tion thus spoke the bhagava delighted with what the bhagava had said those bhikkhus rejoiced end of the cetokhila sutta the sixth in this vagga application of the simile the hen does her three tasks sitting giving her body warmth and suffusing the eggs with her body odour in the same way bhikkhu must fulfil all the fifteen factors set forth for his task ii the three tasks that the hen takes upon herself prevent the eggs from becoming rotten bhikkhu endowed with the fifteen factors meditates on the three characteristics of anicca impermanence dukkha and anatta non soul thus preventing any retrogression of insight gained from meditation iii the three tasks that the hen undertakes cleanse all slime from the eggs just so bhikkhu who meditates fully on these three character istics will cleanse himself of the slime of kilesas defilements iv the shell of hen’s eggs is thin just so the layer of ignorance should be thin in the case of bhikkhu just as the chicks’ claws and beaks are sharp blukkhu’s insight knowledge must be sharp vi the development of chick may be likened to the development of insight knowledge vii the chicks pierce the shells with their pointed claws and beaks and come out safely into this world just so bhikkhu develops insight knowledge and breaks through ignorance by means of arahatta magga ii sihanada vagga vanapattha sutta discourse on forest dwelling thus have heard at one time the bhagavé was staying at the jetavana monastery of anathapindika in savatthi then

till the end of his life he should not leave him even if that person drives him away thus spoke the bhagava delighted those bhikkhus rejoiced in what the bhagava had said end of vanapattha sutta madhupindika sutta round honey cake discourse thus have heard at one time the bhagava was staying at the nigrodharama monastery in kapilavatthu in the kingdom of the sakyans then in the morning the bhagavad suitably rearranged the robes he wore and carrying alms bowl and great robe entered kapilavatthu for alms food after going round kapilavatthu for alms food and having had his meal he left the place and went to the mahavana forest to spend the day and entering the forest sat at the foot of young bael tree to pass the day at that time dandapani sakyan roaming and strolling for walk came to the mahavana forest entering the forest and approaching the young bael tree where the bhagava was he exchanged greetings with the bhagava and after the complimentary and meaningful greeting stood at one side leaning on his walking stick standing there dandapani the sakyan asked the bhagava “what view does the samana hold what does he expound dandapani lit stick in hand this sakyan was known by this name because of his habit of walking with walking stick in his hand although he was not old or infirm after the complimentary and meaningful greeting sammodaniyam kathani saragiyam vitisaretva exchanging greetings of friendliness and courtesy this is stock phrase used when visitor came and greeted the buddha but the behaviour of dandapani shows that he was neither polite nor courteous saraniya is also interpreted as “memorable” or “fit to be remembered in that frivolous or unmeaningtul words are not used in such greeting leaning on his walking stick the commentary describes dandapaqi as resting his chin on his two hands on top of the stick ii sfhanada vagga “friend one who holds that view’ does not engage in dispute with any in the world be it the world of devas maras and brahmas or human world comprising samanas brahmanas rulers and men and because of that view there are no latent safifid mental factors of kilesas in the mind of the brahmana® holding that view who remains one who holds that view yatha vadi lit one who asserts holds view or doctrine yatha vadi is to be connected up to tami brahmanam occurring later in passage here ‘that view’ means the doctrine leading to extinction of kilesas defilements and thus tc nibbana in full this phrase would mean ‘the brahmaga the arahat who holds and asserts the doctrine of nibbana the extinction of kilesas do not engage in dispute non ariyas ordinary beings tend tc be contentious on religious tenets such as impermanence ot permanence arahats and buddhas are not contentious because of that view yatha ca pana that cause that reason this yatha has to be connected up to saiifia nanusenti in full this would mean ‘in the brahmana the arahat mental factors of kilesas the kilesa mind do not arise for certain reason the doctrine setting forth the reason for the non arising of kilesas is the doctrine hold assert and proclaim sannia here this term means kilesa safiiia that is safifia associ ated with or companied by defilements or in short just kilesas defilements an acceptable term would be kilesa mind or mind filled with defilements in other contexts such as in safifiakkhandha sana is translated as ‘perception’ or ‘assimilation of sensation’ in still other contexts the commentary equates saifia with citta mind the brahmana as pointed out in footnote above this is used with reference to yatha vadi by ‘brahmana lit noble personage is here meant one whose mind is solely oriented towards nibbana as he has done away with all forms of defilements and demeritoriousness here an arahat is meant although the buddha does not use the word ‘arahat’ explicitly in other contexts especially in the phrase samana brahmana brahmaga is one who having left hearth and home follows religious life seeking way out of the woes of the mundane world madhupindika sutta detached from sense pleasure who has no wavering uncer tainty who has cut off worry and physical restlessness and who has no craving for any realm of existence high or low friend hold this view this expound when this was said dandapani the sakyan nodded his head wagged his tongue knit his brow to form three wrinkles and departed leaning on his walking stick then in the evening the bhagava emerging from meditation in solitude approached nigrodharama mon astery and having sat on seat prepared for him said to the bhikkhus “bhikkhus in the morning rearranged my robes and carrying alms bowl and great robe entered kapilavatthu for alms food after going round kapilavatthu for alms food and having had my meal left the place and went to the mahavana forest to spend the day and entering the forest sat at the foot of young bael tree to pass the day at that time dandapani sakyan roaming and strolling for walk came to the mahavana forest entering the forest and ap proaching the young bael tree where was he exchanged greetings with me and after the complimentary and meaning ful greeting stood at one side leaning on his walking stick standing there dandapani the sakyan asked me ‘what view does the samana hold what does he expound bhikkhus hold this view evam vadi the view meant here is the doctrine setting forth the extinction of kilesas the source of or reason for their arising and the means by which they come to cease this expound thus proclaim the reason for the latent existence and cropping up of kilesas the reply given by the buddha is very cryptic as dandapani would not have been receptive to fuller explanation to have given no answer to him would not have been prcper after recounting his encounter with dandapani to the bhikkhus that evening the buddha gave brief explanation which was later amplified by the venerable mahakaccana at the request of the bhikkhus this fuller explanation met with the approval of the buddha oy ii sthanéda vagga when this was asked said to dandapani thus ‘friend one who holds that view does not engage in dispute with any in the world be it the world of devas maras and brahmas or human world comprising samanas brahmanas rulers and men and because of that view there are no latent saminda mental factors of kilesas in the mind of the brahmana holding that doctrine who remains detached from sense pleasure who has no wavering uncertainty who has cut off worry and physical restlessness and who has no craving for any realm of existence high or low friend hold this view this expound bhikkhus when this was said dandapani the sakyan nodded his head wagged his tongue knit his brow to form three wrinkles and departed leaning on his walking stick when this was said certain bhikkhu said this to the bhagava “venerable sir holding what view does the bhagava not engage in dispute with any in the world of devas comprising devas maras and brahmas and in the human world comprising samanas brahmanas rulers and men ven erable sir for what reason are there no latent mental factors of kilesas in the mind of the bhagava who is brahmana an arahat who remains detached from sense pleasure who has no wavering uncertainty who has cut off worry and physical restlessness and who has no craving for any realm of existence high or low “bhikkhu there is the source of the group of mental factors that extends samsara the round of existences and ll the group of mental factors that extends sanisara papaficasanfhasankha these mental factors are craving egotistic pride and wrong views that extend being’s journey through sanisara the cycle of re births here also saa is rendered generally as mental factors see footnote on saiha in para literal translation would be ‘sensation assimilation imbued with the yroup of mental factors that extends samsara madhupindika sutta dominates beings if there is nothing in the source to be delighted with or to affirm categorically or to cleave to this itself the absence of delight affirmation cleaving to is the end of latent attachment this itself is the end of latent ill will this itself is the end of latent wrong views this itself is the end of latent uncertainty this itself is the end of latent conceit this itself is the end of latent attachment to existence this itself is the end of latent ignorance this itself is the end of resorting to sticks resorting to weapons quarrels disagreeme nts contentious disputes harsh terms of address such as “you you calumny and lying it is in this source that these evil and demeritorious factors come to cessation without any remainder the bhagava spoke these words having said this the sugata rose from his seat and entered the monastery then soon after the bhagava had left it oc curred to those bhikkus thus “sirs the bhagava rose from his seat and entered the monastery having given this brief exposition without enlarging upon its significance in detail ‘bhikkhu there is the source of the group of mental factors that extends samisara and dominates beings if there is noth ing in the source to be delighted with or to affirm categori cally or to cleave to this itself the absence of delight affirmation cleavig to is the end of latent attachment it is in this source that these evil and demeritorious factors come to cessation without any remainder who might be in the source it in it ettha the source consists of the group of twelve ayatanas sense bases such as eye ear nose tongue body mind sight sound smell taste tangible object and mind objects here the delight is due to the satisfying belief that these twelve sense bases are “i” or “mine” the affirmation is that they are “i” or “mine” and the cleaving is the absorbing attachment to the idea of “i” or “mine” the gist of para is that kilesas defilements arise from the twelve sense bases and that they cease in these sense bases the cessation of these kilesas is nibbana ii sthandda vagga able to explain in detail the significance of this brief exposi tion made without elaboration by the bhagava then it occurred to those bhikkhus thus “the vener able mahakacc na is praised by the teacher and revered by wise companions in the practice of the dhamma he has the ability to explain in full the meaning of this brief exposition which the bhagava has given without enlarging upon the meaning let us approach the venerable mahakaccana and ask him for full explanation of the meaning of this exposition then those bhikkhus approached the venerable mahakaccana exchanged greetings with him saying courte ous and meaningful words of greeting sat in suitable place and addressed the venerable mahakaccana in these words “revered kaccana the bhagava rose from his seat and entered the monastery having given this brief exposition without any elaboration on its meaning ‘bhikkhu there is the source of the group of mental factors that extends sanisara the round of existences and dominates beings if there is

if there is nothing in the source to be delighted with or to affirm categorically or to cleave to this itself the absence of delight affirmation cleaving to is the end of latent attachment it is in this source that these evil and demeritorious factors come to cessation without madhupindika sutta any remainder who might be able to explain in detail the significance of this brief exposition made without elaboration by the bhagavad ‘revered kaccana again it also occurred to us “the venerable mahakaccana is praised by the bhagava and revered by wise companions in the practice of the dharma he has the ability to explain in full the meaning of the brief exposition which the bhagava has left unelaborated let us approach the venerable mahakacc na and ask him for an explanation of the meaning of this exposition may the venerable mahakacc na explain the exposition in full sirs it is as if man desiring to get heartwood seeking heartwood and wandering in search of heartwood were to think that he should look for heartwood in the branches and foliage of standing great tree which has heartwood passing over the root and the trunk even so you think that you should ask us the meaning disregarding lit going beyond the bhagava though you were in the pres ence of the teacher indeed sirs the bhagava knows what should be known and sees what should be seen he is the very eye he is the very knowledge he is the dhamma he is the ariya magga he proclaims the truth he expounds the truth he elucidates the meaning of the truth he is the ‘giver’ of deathlessness nibbana he is the very eye the eye of wisdom the buddha is the guide who makes people see things rightly the very knowledge the buddha is the guide who makes people attain right knowledge the dhamma the buddha teaches the pariyatti the texts of the dhamma he also teaches the factors of enlightenment bodhipakkhiya he is the embodiment of the dhamma hence he is called the lord of the dhamma the ariya magga brahma here

having made this brief exposition without enlarging upon its meaning in detail the bhagava rose from his seat and entered the monastery sirs this is how understand the full meaning of the brief exposition which the bhagava gave without enlarging upon the meaning if you the venerable sirs so desire you may approach the bhagava himself and ask him again about this meaning you should bear it in mind as the bhagavad ex plains it to you then the bhikkhus pleased and satisfied with what the venerable mahdkaccana had said rose from their seats and approached the bhaggava they paid obeisance to the bhagava and sitting at suitable place addressed these words to him “venerable sir the bhagava rose from his seat and entered the monastery having made this brief expo sition without enlarging upon

enlarging upon the meaning “bhikkhu there is the source of the group of mental factors that extends samisara and dominates beings if there is nothing in the source to be delighted with or to affirm

this source that these evil and demeritorious factors come to cessation without any remainder who might be able to explain in detail the meaning of this brief exposition given without elaboration by the bhagava venerable sir it occurred to us thus “the venerable mahakacc na is praised by the teacher and revered by wise companions in the practice of the dhamma the venerable mahakacc na has the ability to explain in full the meaning of this brief exposition which thé bhagava has given without enlarging upon the meaning let us approach the venerable mahakaccana and ask him for full explanation of the meaning of this exposition then venerable sir we approached the venerable mahakaccana and asked him the meaning of this exposition venerable sir the venerable mahakacc na fully explained to us the meaning by these mearf¥° by these sentences and by these words bhikkhus learned is mahakaccana of great wisdom is mahakaccana bhikkhus even had you questioned me as to this meaning would have answered you in the same way as mahakaccana has answered this indeed is the very meaning of the exposition bear it in mind accordingly when this had been said the venerable ananda ‘spoke to the bhagavad “venerable sir it is as if man means akara lit way mode manner reason ground account here this can be rendered ‘by menas of these reasons’ the means employed by the venerable mahakaccana are the exposition of the sense bases as the source of craving egotistic pride and wrong views which are collectively called papafiica dhammas that extend or prolong samsara madhupindika sutta overcome by hunger and exhaustion might come upon round honey cake if he should lick it on any side he would get the same delicious flavour with no need for added sweetness venerable sir in much the same way if an able bhikkhu who could think things out with due wisdom were to examine with due understanding the meaning of this discourse from any aspect he would get satisfaction and clarity of mind venerable sir what might be the name of this discourse ananda because of that simile you may take this exposition of the dhamma as the round honey cake dis course thus spoke the bhagava delighted the venerable ananda rejoiced in what the bhagava had said end of the madhupindika sutta the eighth in this vagga round honey cake madhupigdika its ingredients are butter mo lasses honey and brown sugar ii sthanada vagga dvedhavitakka sutta discourse on two classes of thoughts thus have heard at one time the bhagava was staying at the jetavana monastery of anathapindika in savatthi then the bhagava addressed the bhikkhus as “bhikkhus those bhikkhus re plied “venerable sir the bhagava spoke thus bhikkhus before attained arahattamagga the insight of an arahat while was still bodhisatta who had not yet gained insight into the truth this occurred to me “it would be well if were to make classification of thoughts into two classes then put sensual thought destructive thought and harmful thought into one class and thought of libera ticn from sense pleasures non destructive thought goodwill metta and non harmful thought® compas sion into the second class sensual thought kamavitakka thought based on desire directed to sense pleasures destructive thought byapadavitakka thought based on ill will malevolence directed to killing destroying harming harmful thought vihimsavitakka thought based on cruelty injunog hurting directed to causing harm and injury to others thought of liberation nekkhammavitakka thought associated with renunciation seeking freedom from the clutches of desire for sense pleasures non destructive thought abyapadavitakka thought opposite of ill will or malevolence that motivates killing or destroying positively put this is goodwill metta non harmful thought avihimsavitakka thought opposite of cruelty or hurtful intention that motivates doing harm or injury to others positively put this is compassion dvyedhavitakka sutta bhikkhus while was abiding in mindfulness and diligence directing my mind to nibbana sensual thought arose in me but understood thus “this sensual thought has arisen in me this sensual thought is injurious to me injurious to others and injurious both to myself and others it impedes wisdom it is vexatious and it is not conducive to nibbana ”’ bhikkhus when reflected this sensual thought ts injurious to me or injurious to others or injurious both to myself and others it vanished in me bhikkhus when also reflected this sensual thought impedes wisdom it is vexatious and it is not conducive tc nibbana it vanished in me bhikkhus every time sensual thought arose in me got rid of it removed it did away with it bhikkhus while was thus abiding in mindful ness and diligence directing my mind to nibbana destruc sensual thought arsoe in me to the bodhisatta who for six years practised austerities known as dukkaracariya difficult prac tice there never occurred thoughts or sense pleasures connected with the luxuries of the palace enjoyed by the royalty surrounded by queens and court ladies he was emaciated by long period of self denial after which he had recourse to taking food then he regained stength and his former physical condition he thought about his physical condition that had been regained but as he was man of great wisdom he noted that this thinking about his physical condition amounted to sensual thought the commentary it impedes wisdom paifianirodhika he who has not got rid of sensual thought cannot hope to make progress in knowledge both mundane lokiya and supramundane lokuttara in fact it can even obstruct and destroy the eight attainments samapatti and the five supernormal psychic powers abluifa vanished abbhattha the thought comes to cessation reaches the end and disappears like bubble that bursts ii sfhandda vagga tive thought arose in me harmful thought arose in me but understood thus “this harmful thought has arisen in me this harmful thought is injurious to me injurious to others and injurious both to myself and others it impedes wisdom it is vexatious and it is not conducive to nibbana bhikkhus when reflected this harmful thought is injurious to me or injurious to others or injurious both to myself and others it vanished in me bhikkhus when also reflected this harmful thought impedes wisdom it is vexatious and it is not conducive to nibbana it vanished in me so bhikkhus every time harmful thought arose in me got rid of it removed it did away with it destructive thought arose in me it is not in the nature of bodhisatta to entertain thoughts of killing or destroying others here this thought means the vexation of mind caused by sudden changes in climatic conditions such as heavy rains excessive heat extreme cold etc it does not mean murderous thoughts but rather annoyance with little things that go away the commentary harmful thought arose in me it is not in the nature of bodhisatta to have ill intentions to cause harm to others but the mind of the bodhisatta was disturbed when he encountered acts of harm or injury to others perpetrated by some people or animals on such occasions his mind became distracted oppressed by incidents that he saw it is not that harmful intentions arose in him dvedhavittakka sutta bhikkhus whatever kind of thinking and pondering is repeatedly engaged in the mind becomes inclined habjtuated to that way of thinking and pondering if bhikkhu ‘repeatedly thinks and ponders on sensual things if he has repeated sensual thoughts this means he has abandoned thought of liberation from sense pleasures and has indulged in repeated sensual thought then the mind of that bhikkhu is inclined only to sensual thought if bhikkhu repeatedly thinks and ponders destructive thoughts if bhikkhu repeatedly thinks and ponders harmful thoughts this means he has abandoned non harmful thought and has in dulged in repeated harmful thought then the mind of that bhikkhu is inclined only to harmful thought bhikkhus it is as if in the last month of the rains in the season of sarada roughly autumn cowherd would tend cattle on narrow piece of land in the midst of crops and would beat the cows with stick on their backs or on their sides and would restrain and check them what is the reason for that bhikkhus it is because the cowherd foresees the danger of slaughter or impounding or loss or censure as consequence of cows eating the crop bhikkhus in the same way saw the fault the vileness and the pollution in demeritorious thoughts and the advantages arising from purity of meritorious thoughts of liberation from sense pleasures in the simile of the cowherd and his cattle in para the field thick with crops denotes the six sense objects such as visible object sound demeritorious thoughts are likened to unruly cows the cowherd is the bodhisatta slaughter impounding loss and ‘censure or blame are the four dangers arising from demeritorious actions that bring misery to oneself to others and to both foreseeing such dangers the cowherd tends his cows restraining and checking them from eating the crops in like manner the bodhisatta controlled and restrained his mind so that thoughts of sense pleasures failed to arise when the mind came into contact with sense objects such as visible object sound etc for he foresaw the dangers of loss of control ii sthandda vagga bhikkhus while was thus abiding in mind fulness and diligence directing my mind to nibbana thought of liberation’ from sense pleasures arose in me and understood thus “this thought of liberation has arisen in me it is not injurious to me nor injurious to others nor injurious both to myself and to others it makes for the growth of wisdom causes no vexation and it is conducive to nibbana bhikkhus even if that the thought of liberation should be thought and pondered throughout the night see no danger from that source bhikkhus even if that the thought of liberation should be thought and pondered throughout the day see no danger from that source bhikkhus even if that should be thought and pondered throughout night and day see no danger from that source however after long process of thinking and ponder ing the body would be weary if the body were to become weary the mind would be distracted and if the mind were to get distracted it would be far removed from concentration thought of liberation this means liberation from all kinds of demeritorious thoughts and from all kilesas defilements meritori ous thoughts and freedom from kilesas point the way to nibbana the growth of wisdom the mundane lokiya and the supramundane lokuttara knowledges that have not yet arisen arise and those that have arisen get developed see no danger the danger of causing harm or injury to oneself or to other or to both herein the buddha reveals the three kinds of experiences in the initial stages of insight meditation which he practised in the first instance the bodhisatta practised vipassana insight meditation based on samapatti sustained jhana at this initial stage his practice of concentration samadhi and insight meditation vipassana had not yet been fully developed sitting long in meditation he felt tired and hot in the body sweat flowed from his arm pits he felt that his scalp was almost in flames then his mind became distracted unable to concentrate it is with reference to this personal experience that the buddha spoke of distracted mind far removed from concen tration dvedhavitakka sutta accordingly bhikkhus kept my mind only on an object of concentration within myself calmed it well brought jt to one pointedness of mind and set it up well in concentration what was the reason for this it was so that my mind might not be distracted bhikkhus while was thus abiding in mindful ness and diligence directing my mind to nibbana goodwill lit non destructive thought arose in me compassion lit non harmful thought arose in me and understood thus this compassion lit non harmful thought has arisen in me it is not injurious to me nor injurious to others nor injurious to both myself and others it makes for the growth of wisdom it causes no vexation and it is conducive to nibbana bhikkhus even if that the non harmful thought should be thought and pondered throughout the night see no danger from that source bhikkhus even if that the non harmful thought should be thought and pondered through out the day see no danger from that source bhikkhus even if that should be thought and pondered throughout night and day see no danger from that source however after long process of thinking and pondering the body would be weary if the body were to become weary the mind would be distracted and if the mind were to get distracted it would when his mind became distracted during vipassana insight meditation the bodhisatta had recourse to samapatti sustained jhana or ecstatic meditation and then he reverted to vipassana after having regained composure just as strong fortifications prove beneficial to troops in battle so does samapatti to those practising vipassana conversely vipassana is beneficial to samapatti when vipassana is strengthened it strengthens samapatti and saméapatti in turn fortifies vipassana they are like the cart and the boat the cart can carry the boat with allits load in journeys by road just as the boat can carry the cart with all its load when river is to be crossed this passage shows inter dependence between samapatti and vipassana ii sthanada vagga be far removed from concentration accordingly bhikkhus kept my mind only on an object of concentration within myself calmed it well brought it to one pointedness of mind and set it up well in concentration what was the reason for this it was so that my mind might not be distracted bhikkhus whatever kind of thinking and pondering is repeatedly engaged in the mind becomes inclined habituated to that way of thinking and pondering if bhikkhu repeatedly thinks and ponders on liberation from sense pleasures he has abandoned thought of sense plea sures and has engaged himself in repeated thought of libera tion the mind of that bhikkhu is inclined only to thought of liberation from sense pleasures if bhikkhu repeatedly thinks and ponders thoughts of goodwill if bhikkhu repeat edly thinks and ponders thoughts of compassion he has abandoned harmful thought and has engaged himself in repeated thought of non harmfulness compassion then the mind of that bhikkhu is inclined only to non harmful thought compassion bhikkhus it is as if in the last month of the hot season when all crops have been brought to the vicinity of the village cowherd would tend cattle while staying at the foot of tree or in the open as he would need to be only mindful that those were the cattle he was tending in the same way bhikkhus needed to be just mindful that those were the thoughts had bhikkhus had made unrelenting effort mind fulness was steadfast in me it was constant my person both in body and mind was concentrated on one object here the bodhisatta’s knowledge of samatha calm and vipassand insight has become sharpened at that stage he could attain the eight samapattis by single effort and when he practised vipassana he could go through the seven anupassana modes of contemplation on anicca impermanence dukkha and anatta non self etc very rapidly dvedhavittakka sutta bhikkhus being detached from sensual pleasures and demeritorious factors achieved and remained in the first jhana which has vitakka initial application of the mind vicara sustained application of the mind and whcih has piti delightful satisfaction and sukha bliss born of detachment from the nivaranas hindrances having got rid of vitakka and vicara achieved and remained in the second jhana with internal tranquillity with enhancement of one pointed ness of mind devoid of vitakka and vicdra but with piti and sukha born of concentration having been detached from piti as well dwelt in equanimity with mindfulness and clear comprehension and experienced sukha in mind and body achieved and re mained in the third jhana that which causes person who attains it to be praised by the ariyas as one who has equanimity and mindfulness one who abides in sukha by dispelling both pleasure and pain and by the previous disappearance of gladness and sadness achieved and remained in the fourth jhana without pleasure and pain state of equanimity and absolute purity of mindfulness when the settled mind had thus become perfectly pure cleansed unsullied by defilements uncontaminated ly defilements malleable

in this way could recollect my many and varied existences together with their characteristics and related facts such as names and clans bhikkhus in the first part of the night gained this first vijja

there came lit appeared man who desired to bring about loss disadvantage and insecurity to the herd he might block the safe secure and pleasant path and open up treacherous path stationing there male deer as decoy and doe as lure if this were done bhikkhus after time that herd of deer would meet with misfortune and destruction bhukkhus if there appeared man desiring to do good to bring well being and to provide safety to the herd of deer he would open up the safe secure and pleasant path and block the treacherous path remove the male decoy and do away with the female lure if this were done the great herd of deer would after time grow thrive and increase bhikkhus to illustrate the meaning of this discourse gave you the simile here is the significance of the simile bhikkhus the low lying marsh stands for sense plea sures the herd of deer beings bhikkhus that man who desired to bring about loss disadvantage and insecurity is mara the evil one the treacherous path refers to the wrong path of eight constituents and what is this wrong path of eight constituents it is the path that comprises wrong view wrong thought wrong speech wrong ac tion wrong livelihood wrong effort wrong mindfulness and wrong concentration bhikkhus the male decoy is ii sthanada vagga nandiraga passionate attachment to sense objects bhikkhus the female lure is avijja ignorance bhikkhus the man who desired the advantage the well being and the safety of beings is the tathagata worthy of special veneration the perfectly self enlightened bhikkhus the safe secure and pleasant path is this ariya path of eight constituents and what is this ariya path of eight constituents it is the path that comprises right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration bhikkhus thus have opened this safe secure and pleasant ariya path having blocked the wrong path having removed the male decoy of nandiraga passionate attach ment and having done away with the female lure of avijja ignorance bhikkhus what compassionate teacher who has the welfare of his disciples at heart should do out of compassion for the disciples that have done for you bhikkhus there are the places at the foot of trees there are the secluded places bhikkhus meditate do not be unmind ful do not be remorseful later this is our instruction to you thus spoke the bhagava delighted the bhikkhus rejoiced in what the bhagava had’ said end of the dvedhavitakka sutta the ninth in this vagga attracted by ignorance personified as the female lure beings are drawn to craving for sense objects personified as the male decoy because of this they are subjected to the round of existences vitakkasanthana sutta discourse on the origin of thoughts thus have heard at one time the bhagava was staying at the jetavana monastery of anathapindika in savatthi then the bhagava addressed the bhikkhus saying “bhikkhus the bhikkhus answered the bhagava saying venerable sir the bhagava spoke these words bhikkhus bhikkhu striving for higher conscious ness of sam patti attainment which is the basis of vipassana insight should from time to time pay attention to the five objects what are the five bhikkhus in this teaching to bhikkhu who pays attention to certain object there might arise in him on account of that object evil and demeritorious thoughts asso ciated with desire associated with anger and associated with bewilderment bhikkhus then that bhikkhu should pay atten tion to some other object that is associated with what is meritorious to that bhikkhu who pays attention to the ob jects associated with what is evil and demeritorious thoughts associated with attachment associated with hatred and associ ated with bewilderment are got rid of and made to

only one meal day know that become free from illness free from affliction buoyant strong and comfortable come bhikkhus you also take one meal day as you take one meal day you will come to know that you become free from illness free from affliction buoyant strong and comfortable bhikkhus did not have to admonish those bhikkhus merely make them mindful just as bhikkhus master trainer skilled in taming horses were to mount that chariot standing on level ground at cross roads harnessed with thoroughbreds with whip hanging handy having taken the reins in his left hand and the whip in his right to drive it straight as he wished and turn back even so bhikkhus did not have to admonish those bhikkhus merely made them mindful that being so bhikkhus do you get rid of what is demeritorious and make iii opamma vagga efforts to acquire what is meritorious if you do so you will come to growth prosperity and development in this teaching bhikkhus suppose there were great sal wood forest overgrown with castor oil plant close to village or town there might come man who wishes the good of the forest its wellbeing and its security and having cut off those sal tree saplings which are bent and which are drain on the nutriment of the soil he would take them out and clear the jungle he would however tend properly those sal tree sap lings which grow straight and are well developed thus bhikkhus after some time this sal wood forest will come to growth prosperity and development in like manner bhikkhus do you get rid of what is demeritorious and make efforts to acquire what is meritorious if you do so you will come to growth prosperity and developrient in this teaching bhikkhus it so happened in the past that in this very city of savatthi there was lady house holder by the name of vedehika and there had spread the good reputation about vedehika the lady householder vedehika the lady householder is gentle meek and serene now bhikkhus vedehika the lady householder had slave woman named kali who was skilled diligent and good at house keeping then it occurred to the slave woman kali thus “there has spread the good reputation about vedehika the lady householder vedehika the lady householder is gentle meek and serene how is that is it beacuse my mistress does not show her bad temper that lies inwardly in her or is it because she does not show it as it is absent in her or is it because keep house so well that my mistress does not show her bad temper even though it is present inwardly in her and not that she does not show it because it is absent in her it would be good if were to put my mistress to test then bhikkhus the slave woman got up late the next day at this vedehika the lady householder spoke out to kali the slave woman exclaiming “hey kaji kakacutpama sutta “what is the matter mistress replied kali “you bad slave why did you get up late asked vedehika ““that’s nothing mistress said the slave woman “nothing indeed you bad slave got up late in the day without any reason saying so she frowned being angry and displeased and bhikkhus it again occurred to kali the slave woman thus “my mistress does not show her bad temper even though she has it inwardly it is not that she does not show it because it is absent in her it is because keep house so well that my mistress has no occasion to show her bad temper it is not that she does not show it because it is absent in her it would be good if were to put my mistress to test further then bhikkhus that kali the slave woman got up very late the next day at this vedehika the lady house holder spoke out to kali the slave woman exclaiming “hey kali “what is the matter mistress replied kali “you why did you get up late asked vedehika “that’s nothing mistress said the slave woman “nothing indeed you bad slave got up late in the day without any reason saying so she spoke words of displeasure and bhikkhus it again occurred to kali the slave woman thus “my mistress does not show her bad temper even though she has it inwardly it is not that she does not show it because it is absent in her it is because keep house so well that my mistress has no occasion to show her bad temper it is not that she does not show it because it is absent in her it would be good if were to put my mistress to test further then bhikkhus that the slave woman got up very late the next day at this vedehika the lady house holder spoke out to ali the slave woman exclaiming “hey kali “what is the matter mistress replied kali “you why did you get up late asked vedehika “that’s nothing mistress said the slave woman “nothing indeed iii opamma vagga you bad slave got up late in the day without any reason and angry and displeased she beat the slave woman on her head with door bolt and cracked it then bhikkhus kali the slave woman with her head broken and streaming with blood spread the news among her neighbours com plaining “see madams the deed of the gentle one see madams the deed of the meek one see madams the deed of the serene one why did she beat me her only slave woman on the head with door bolt and crack it having become angry and displeased thereafter bhikkhus evil reputation about vedehika the lady householder became widespread thus “vedehika the lady householder is violent not meek and not serene even so bhikkhus some bhikkhu in this teaching is as gentle as gentle can be as meek as meek can be and as serene as serene can be as long as he is not confronted with disagreeable ways of speech bhikkhu it is only when the bhikkhu is confronted with disagreeable ways of speech that one can judge him to be gentle meek and serene bhikkhus do not declare the bhikkhu who comes to be easy to speak to because of robes alms food shelter and medicines and medicinal requisites for use in sickness as one who is easy to speak to why do not declare so it is because that bhikkhu does not come to be easy to speak to when he fails to get robes alms food shelter and medicines and medicinal requisites for use in sickness declare only the bhikkhu who respecting only the dhamma revering only the dhamma honouring only the dhamma worshipping only the dhamma and

let the earth be not earth ”’spreading it here and there spitting at it here and there urinating on it here and there what do you think of this bhikkhus would that man make the great earth not earth “no he wouldn’t venerable sir said the bhikkhus why is it so “venerable sir said the bhikkhus “this great earth iii opamma vagga is massive it is immeasurable so it is not easy to make it not earth

any of those ways of speaking whether subtle or gross that you cannot tolerate ‘““ no venerable sir replied the bhikkhus therefore bhikkhus do you pay constant attention to this exhortation on the simile of the saw it will be to your benefit and happiness for long time thus spoke the bhagava delighted those bhikkhus rejoiced in what the bhagava had said end of kakacupama sutta the first in this vagga iii opamma vagga alagaddupama sutta the snake simile discourse thus have heard at one time the bhagava was staying at the jetavana monastery of anathapindika in savatthi at that time there arose in bhikkhu arittha formerly of the vulture slayers depraved view thus ‘i know all the dhammas practices which are taught by the bhagavad and stated by him as being obstacles detrimental to the achievement of jhana magga and phala for one who indulges in these dhammas they obstacles antarayika dhamma the commentary gives list of five kinds of impediments to attainment of jhana magga and phala bhikkhu arittha was learned exponent of the teaching and he knew the ‘obstacles’ well but he was not proficient in the vinaya rules he does not specify what impediments he thinks are not nec essarily impediments but it is clear from what follows that he regards sense gratification particularly sexual intercourse as not really an impediment even for bhikkhu as taught by the buddha who indulges in these dhammas according to bhikkhu anf tha just as lay people whether stream winner sotapanna or once returner sakadagami or never returner anagami can enjoy the five sensual pleasures so too bhikkhus can view pleasant sights listen to pleasant sounds smell fragrance eat palatable food and enjoy soft beds that being so arittha argued that sights sounds smells tastes and contacts appertaining to females are to be considered as proper for the bhikkhus he therefore held the view that bhikkhus do not commit any offence when they enjoy the five sense pleasures derived from women in his view they could not be impediments to jhana magga and phala and he said so in the presence of the buddha alagaddipama sutta cannot be obstacles detrimental to the achievement of jhana magga and phala many bhikkhus heard that there arose in bhikkhu arittha formerly of the vulture slayers depraved view thus ‘i know all the dhammas practices which are taught by the bhagava and stated by him as being obstacles detrimental to the achievement of jhana magga and phala for one who indulges in these dhammas they cannot be obstacles detrimental to the achievement of jhana magga and phala then the bhikkhus approached bhikkhu ‘arittha formerly of the vulture slayers and asked him “avuso arittha is it true that there has arisen in you depraved view thus ‘i know all the dhammas practices which are taught by the bhagavad and stated by him as being obstacles detrimental to the achievement of jhana magga and phala for one who indulges in these dhammas they cannot be obstacles detri mental to the

arittha from this depraved view questioned him pressed him for confirmation and asked him the reasons saying ““avuso arittha say not so do not slander the bhagava by misrep resentation slandering the bhagava by misrepresentation is not good certainly the bhagava would not have spoken thus avuso arittha in many ways the bhagava has said of those obstacles that they are obstacles detrimental to the achievement of jhana magga and phala those obstacles are really obstacles for one who indulges in their practice the bhagava has said that sense pleasures have little to satisfy but cause much suffering and great trouble there is much peril iii opamma vagga in these sense pleasures the bhagavad says sense pleasures are like unto bones shorn of flesh like unto lump of meat like unto grass torch like unto pit of burning coals like unto dream like unto things borrowed like unto tree with fruit like unto chopping block like unto an impaling stake and like unto snake’s head sense pleasures cause much suffering and great trouble there is much peril in these sense pleasures although he was thus questioned pressed for confirmation and asked for reasons bhikkhu arittha formerly of the vulture slayers stuck to his former assertion of the depraved view which he had pondered in an abso lutely wrong way saying “sirs it is true as you have heard know all the dhammas practices which are taught by the bhagava and stated by him as being obstacles detrimental to the achievement of jhana magga and phala for one who indulges in these dhammas they cannot be obstacles detri mental to the achievement of jhana magga and phala like unto lump of meat manisapestpama meat is common to many and so are the five kinds of sensual pleasures thus causing conflict like unto grass torch tigukkupama

five khandhas are cut or minced an impaling stake sattisdla lit spear stake an impaling stake pierces the body where previously there was noinjury likewise sense pleasures penetrate into human beings like unto snake’s head sappasirupama snake’s head is hor ribly dangerous and so are sense pleasures that benefit one not now or hereafter alagaddipama sutta when those bhikkhus were unable to dissuade bhikkhu arittha formerly of the vulture slayers from this depraved view they approached the bhagavad made obei sance to him and having sat down at suitable place spoke thus to the bhagava “venerable

taught by the bhagava and stated by him as being obstacles detrimental to the achievement of jhana magga and phala for one who indulges in these dhammas they cannot iii opamma vagga be obstacles detrimental to the achievement of jhana magga and phala “venerable sir desiring to dissuade bhikkhu arittha formerly of the vulture slayers from this depraved view we questioned him pressed him for confirmation and asked him the reasons in this way ‘avuso arittha say not so do not slander the bhagava by misrepresentation slandering the bhagava by misrepresentation is not good certainly the bhagava would not have spoken thus avuso arittha in many ways the bhaggva has said of those obstacles that they are obstacles detrimental to the achievement of jhana magga and phala those obstacles are really obstacles for one who indulges in their practice the bhagava has said that sense pleasures have little to satisfy but cause much suffering and great trouble and that there is much peril in these sense pleasures the bhagava says sense pleasures are like unto bones shorn of flesh and like unto snake’s head sense pleasures cause much suffering and great trouble and there is much peril in these sense pleasures “although bhikkhu arittha formerly of the vulture slayers was thus questioned by us pressed for confirmation and asked for reasons he stuck to his former assertion of the depraved view which he had pondered in an absolutely wrong way saying ‘sirs it is true as you have heard know all the dhammas practices which are taught by the bhagava and stated by him as being obstacles detrimental to the achievement of jhana magga and phala for one who indulges in these dhammas they cannot be obstacles detri mental to the achievement of jhana magga and phala now unable to dissuade bhikkhu arittha formerly of the vulture slayers from the depraved view we are reporting this matter to the bhagava then the bhagava said to certain bhikkhu “come bhikkhu inform bhikkhu arittha formerly of the alagaddipama sutta vulture slayers at my instance thus ‘avuso arittha the teacher summons you’ the bhikkhu replied “‘very well venerable sir’ to the bhagava and approached bhikkhu arittha formerly of the vulture slayers and told the latter avuso arittha the teacher summons you saying very well avuso to the bhikkhu bhikkhu arittha formerly of the vulture slayers approached the bhagavad made obeisance to him and sat in suitable place and the bhagavad spoke to bhikkhu arittha formerly of the vulture slayers who was thus sitting “arittha is it true that depraved view has arisen in you thus ‘i know all the dhammas practices which are taught by the bhagava and stated by him as being obstacles detrimental to the achievement of jhana magga and phala for one who

in many ways said of those obstacles that they are the obstacles and that these obstacles are really obstacles for one who indulges in their practice have not taught that sense pleasures have little

us by attributing to us your own wrong view you have ruined yourself your own future and have produced much demeritoriousness which will bring you empty man no good put sorrow for long time to come then the bhagava addressed the bhikkhus “bhikkhus what do you think of this has this bhikkhu arittha formerly of the vulture slayers even faint glow of under standing in this teaching “how could this be venerable sir this could not be when the bhikkhus had said this bhikkhu arittha formerly of the vulture slayers sat silent confused with drooping shoulders and bent head downcast and incapable of making an answer then the bhagavad realizing that bhikkhu arittha formerly of the vulture slayers had become silent confused with drooping shoulders and bent head downcast even faint glow of understanding usmikatopi setting himself against the buddha’s omniscience sabbafifiuta fiana and ignor ing the buddha’s perfect self confidence vesarajja fidna ari ha took to wrong view that could bring about the deterioration of the teaching could he then be said to have any “understanding of the teaching could such bhikkhu tread the path and enjoy the fruits by means of the evil view alagaddipama sutta and incapable of making an answer said to him “empty man you shall be known by this depraved view shall now question the bhikkhus about this wrong view then the bhagava asked the bhikkhus ‘“bhikkhus do you too understand the teaching that have expounded in the same way as understood by bhikkhu arittha formerly of the vulture slayers who slanders us by attributing to us his own wrong view who has ruined himself and has produced much demeritoriousness “no venerable sir indeed the bhagava in many ways has said of those obstacles that they are obstacles detrimental to the achievement of jhana magga and ‘phala and that they are really obstacles for one who indulges in their practice the bhagava has taught us that sense pleasures have little to satisfy but cause much suffering and great trouble and that there is much peril in these sense pleasures the bhagava has taught us sense pleasures are like unto bones shorn of flesh like unto snake’s head the bhagava has taught us that sense pleasures cause much suf fering and great trouble and that there is much peril in these sense pleasures bhikkhus it is well and good that you have under stood properly the dhammas that have thus taught indeed in many ways have pointed out the obstacles detrimental to the achievement of jhana magga and phala and have said that they are really obstacles for one who indulges in their practice have taught that sense pleasures have little to satisfy but cause much suffering and great trouble and that there is much peril in these sense pleasures have taught that sense pleasures

demeritoriousness which will bring him an empty man no good but sorrow for long time to come indeed bhikkhus it is not possible for that bhikkhu to indulge in sense gratification without taking delight in sense pleasures without taking keen note of the factors of sense pleasures and without thoughts of sense pleasures which are kilesas defilements in this sdsana bhikkhus some empty men void

there were man wanting to get snake looking for snake and going about in search of snake who were to find big snake he might catch hold of the snake by the body or by the tail then the snake might turn on him and bite his hand or arm of some other limb of his body large or small for that reason he might suffer death or deadly pain what is the reason for this it is bhikkhus because he grasped the snake in wrong way remain unclear not knowing whether in particular context the buddha was speaking about sila morality or samadhi concentra lion or vipassana insight meditation or magga insight into nibbana and phala the fruition or va akatha thesis of the round of existences or viva akatha thesis éf the end of the round of existences thus these people do not attain the insight of understanding for the advantage of reproving others uparambhanisanisa to study the texts of the teaching only for the purpose of criticising other creeds they do not reap any benefit of magga and

for magga and phala study the texts of sutta geyya veyyakaran gatha udana itivuttaka jataka abbutadhamma and vedalla without investigating with wisdom into the meaning or purpose of those texts and

it is because bhikkhus the texts are rightly grasped bhikkhus to say it figuratively suppose there were man wanting to get snake looking for snake and going about in search of snake who were to find big snake he might press it down with forked stick holding down the snake firmly with the forked stick he might grasp it nghtly by the neck bhikkhus even though that snake might wind its coils round that man’s hand or arm or some other limb of alagaddupama sutta his body large or small he would not suffer death or deadly pain on that account what is the reason for this it is bhikkhus because he grasped the snake in right way in like manner bhikkhus in this sdsana some worthy men study the texts of sutta geyya veyyakarana gatha udana itivuttaka jataka abbhutadhamma and vedalla duly

meaning of what say bear it in mind as you know it if you do not know the meaning of what say you should ask me or the learned bhikkhus on what you do not know bhikkhus shall expound the teaching in the form of parable of the raft which is for crossing over and not for retaining listen to it and pay good attention shall deilver the discourse “very well venerable sir said the bhikkhus to the bhagava and the bhagava spoke thus bhikkhus suppose there was man making long journey who might see large and deep expanse of water of which one side was fearsome and dangerous while the other bank was secure and free from danger but there might be neither boat nor bridge to cross from one side to the other then it might occur to that man ‘this is vast expanse of water of which this side is fearsome and dangerous while the further bank is secure and free from danger there is neither boat nor bridge to cross from this side to that side it would be good if were to gather reeds pieces of iii opamma vagga wood branches and leaves and make them into raft and depending on that raft and making exertions with my hands and feet cross over safe and sound to the other bank ’then bhikkhus that man might gather reeds pieces of wood branches and leaves make them into raft and depending on carried by that raft and making exertions with his hands and feet cross over safe and sound to the other bank then it might again occur to that man who had crossed and reached the other bank ‘this raft has been of great service to me depending on it and making exertions with my hands and feet have crossed safe and sound to this other bank better it is that should go from here as please carrying it on my head or on my shoulders bhikkhus what do you think of this if he does this will he be considered as man doing what should be done with the raft “no venerable sir then bhikkhus what should he have done with that raft bhikkhus in this matter if that man who has crossed to the other bank were to think thus this raft has been of great service to me depending on it and making exertions with my hands and feet have crossed safe and sound to this other bank better it is that should go from here as please after have beached this raft on firm ground or let it float away on the water if that man were to do this he is to be considered as man doing what should be done with that raft thus bhikkhus have expounded the teaching in the form of parable of raft which should be for crossing over and not for retaining bhikkhus you who understand the teaching in this parable of the raft should abandon even the good factors of desire and attachment concerning tranquillity alagaddipama sutta meditation and insight meditation how much mote should you not get rid of the wrong factors of desire and attachment concerning sense pleasures bhikkhus there are these six grounds for wrong views and what are the six in this world bhikkhus an uninformed worldling not in the habit of associating with lit seeing the ariyas unskilled in the teaching of the ariyas untrained in the teaching of the ariyas not in the habit of associating with men of virtue unskilled in the teaching of men of virtue untrained in the teaching of men of virtue perceives corporeality as “this is mine this is ‘i’ this is my self perceives sensation as “this is mine this is ‘i’ this is my self perceives perception as “this is mine this is ‘t’ this is my self perceives volitional activities as “these are mind these are ‘i’ these are my self perceives sense object that can be seen heard sensed cognized encountered by this it must be understood that even desire for and attachment to insight meditation noble and elevating as it is should be got rid of at certain stage so what more can be said of desire for and attachment to sensual pleasures thus ari tha’s assertion “attachment to and desire for sense pleasures is no offence becomes untenable see appendix for an explanation of “desire for and at tachment to insight meditation” this is mine this is i’ this is my self such views are due to ignorance or denial of the fundamental concepts of anicca dukkha anatta sensed by the senses of smell taste and touch muta of the ‘five senses of sight sound smell taste and touch the last three recognize their objects only when there is contact between them and the respective sense bases this is muta cognized the term denotes apperception the reaction of the mind to mind objects or sense objects encountered after seeking or without seeking iii opamma vagga sought after and reflected upon” by the mind as “this sense object is mine this sense object is ‘i’ this sense object is my self’ and perceives this ground for the view which says “i am the loka world am the self will come into being hereafter permanent lasting eternal not liable to change and standing eternally like all things eter nal as “this view is mine this view is ‘i’ this view is my self bhikkhus however the instructed ariya disciple in the habit of associating with ariyas skilled in the teaching of ariyas trained in the teaching of ariyas in the habit of associating with men of virtue skilled in the teaching of men of virtue trained in the teaching of men of virtue perceives” corporeality correctly as “this is not mine this is not ‘i’ this is not my self perceives sensation correctly as “this is not mine this is not ‘i’ this is not my self ”’ perceives perception correctly as “this is not mine this is not ‘i’ this is not my self perceives volitional activities correctly as “these are not mine these are not ‘i’ these are not my self perceives correctly sense object that can be seen heard sensed cognized encountered sought after and reflected upon sought after the senses seek their own respective objects whether or not they are encountered reflected upon the mind reflects upon certain object without any effort to seek it and the object may or may not be encountered “i am the loka am the self’ so loko so atta taking cor poreality sensation perception volitional activities and conscious ness as loka world or atta self perceives through repeated contemplation there are four kinds of contemplation contemplation involving craving con templation based on egotistic pride contemplation based on wrong views and contemplation with knowledge titthiyas contemplate with craving pride and wrong view whereas the disciples of the buddha contemplate with knowledge alagaddipama sutta by the mind as “this sense object is not mine this sense object is not ‘i this sense object is not my self and perceives correctly this ground for the view which says “i am the loka world am the self will come into being hereafter permanent lasting eternal not liable to change and standing eternally like all things eternal ’’as this view is not mine this view is not ‘i’ this view is not my self correctly perceiving thus and finding that nothing exists he has no longing when thus said certain bhikkhu asked the bhagava “venerable sir could there be longing when external objects”® are non existent bhikkhu there could be said the bhagava in this world bhikkhu someone thinks “i had it some posses sion or other no longer have it it should indeed be mine but have not got it then he grieves mourns laments beats his breast and becomes greatly bewildered thus bhikkhu there is longing when external objects are non existent nothing exists finding that the ground for false views does not exist has no longing na panitassati lit does not long for the term paritassati can be interpretted as “to show longing after something to crave for something ii “to be excited to be tormented to be distressed to be worried the two interpretations can be combined by the rendering “to fear through craving if there exists no grasping at the five khandhas or aggregates with craving pride and wrong views there will be no cause for distress ‘of mind through fear and craving all things in reality do not exist as entities in the form of mine man woman tree robe etc though conventionally and in superficial terms they do external objects bahiddha they are such material objects as the requisites of alms food robes shelter and medicines and medicinal requisites which are external to oneself one feels distressed when such objects to which one is attached with craving are either absent or are destroyed conversely one does not feel distressed when there is no attachment ff iii opamma vagga “venerable sir could there be non longing when ex ternal objects are non existent bhikkhu there could be said the bhagava in this world bhikkhu someone does not think thus ‘i had it le some possession or other no longer have it it should indeed be mine but have indeed not got it then he does not grieve does not mourn does not lament does not beat his breast and does not become greatly bewildered thus bhikkhu there is no longing when external objects are non existent “venerable sir could there be longing when internal objects are non existent bhikkhu there could be said the bhagavad in this world bhikkhu someone thinks thus ‘i am the loka world am the self will come into being hereafter permanent lasting eternal not liable to change and standing eternally like all things eternal he hears the tathagata or disciple of the tathagata expounding the teaching leading to the rooting out of all grounds for views their basis their up surge adherence to them latent inclination to them leading to the calming of all volitional kammic processes leading to the relinquishing of all substrata of existence on which dukkha rests leading to the extermination of craving leading to the end of attachment to sensual pleasures leading to cessation of craving and to nibbana he then thinks ‘shall be annihilated shall be destroyed shall not come into being again then he grieves mourns laments beats his breast and becomes greatly bewildered thus bhikkhu there is longing when internal objects are non existent internal objects ajjhatta to titthiyas non buddhists the five khandhas or aggregates of corporeality sensation perception voli tional activities are internal objects to which they are attached with craving believing them to be the self which is eternal and everlasting when there is no attachment to them as self longing does not arise and conversely where there is attachment there arises longing alagaddupama sutta “venerable sir could there be non longing when in ternal objects are non existent there could be bhikkhu said the bhagava in this world bhikkhu someone does not think ‘i am the loka

permanent lasting eternal not liable to change standing eternally like all things eternal bhikkhus have you ever seen such objects that are permanent lasting eternal not liable to change standing eternally like all other things eternal which should be kept in possession °° “no venerable sir good bhikkhus neither have seen objects that are permanent lasting eternal not liable to change able to stand eternally like all things eternal which should be kept in possession objects which should be kept in possession this refers to objects animate or inanimate external to oneself iii opamma vagga bhikkhus if there were theory of atta that when grasped would not give rise to grief lamentation pain distress and despair you should grasp it but have you bhikkhus ever come across such theory of

of the wrong beliefs arising out of belief in atta alagaddupama sutta ifs things eternal’ an entirely and completely foolish doctrine “venerable sir how could it be not so venerable sir it is an

“painful venerable sir is it proper to consider what is impermanent painful and subject to change as “this is mine this is ‘i’ this is my self atta ’’ “indeed no venerable sir bhikkhus what do you think of this is sensation® pp is perception®® are volitional activities is impermanent anicca the five aggregates of corporeality etc are impermanent because after they arise they pass away and this phenomenon of arising and dissolution is the characteristic of anicca impermanence painful dukkha painful because of the inherently painful nature of the aggregates of corporeality etc which arise deteriorate and disappear subject to change viparinamadhamma the five aggregates are constantly coming into being falling into decay and succumbing to dissolution contemplation of this process is dukkhanupassana meditation on dukkha sensation vedana there are three kinds of sensation sukha vedand pleasant sensation dukkha vedana unpleasant sensa tion and upekkha vedana neither pleasant nor unpleasant sensation perception safiia there are six forms of perception each assimi lating sensation from visible object ii sound ili odour iv taste tangible object and vi mind object they are to be contemplated upon so that the characteristics of anicca dukkha and anatta are perceived volitional activities safikhara they are the fifty out of fifty two mental concomitants excluding sensation and perception that condition the actions of body and mind they are to be contem plated upon likewise iii opamma vagga consciousness permanent or impermanent “impermanent venerable sir that which is impermanent is it painful or pleasant “painful venerable‘sir is it proper to consider what is impermanent painful and subject to change as “this is mine this is ‘i’ this is my self atta ’’ “indeed no venerable sir therefore bhikkhus whatever corporeality there is in this world all corporeality whether past future or present whether in oneself or external whether gross or delicate whether inferior or superior whether far or near should be perceived with insight wisdom as it really is thus “this is not mine this is not ‘i’ this is not my self atta all sensation all perception all volitional activities all consciousness past future or present in oneself or external gross or delicate inferior or superior far or near should be perceived with insight wisdom as it really is thus “this is not mine this is not ‘i this is not my self atta bhikkhus on perceiving thus the well instructed ariya disciple becomes disgusted with corporeality with sen sation with perception with volitional activities and with consciousness on being disgusted thus he is free from attachment on being free from attachment he is liberated on being liberated knowledge of liberation arises he knows distinctly “rebirth is no more fulfilled is the noble practice of purity done is all there is to be done to realize magga there is nothing more to do for such realization ’’ consciousness vififiana there are six forms of consciousness eye consciousnes ear consciousness nose consciousness tongue conscious ness body consciousness and mind consciousness they are to be contemplated upon likewise free from attachment virajjati being without attachment or craving attaining magga is liberated vimuccati attains phala fruition alagaddupama sutta bhikkhus this bhikkhu is said to have lifted the cross bar to open the door totally destroyed the moat uprooted the door post and dismantled the door and he is said to be devoid of kilesas having taken down the flag having laid down the burden having been freed from egotis tic pride bhikkhus how has the bhikkhu lifted the cross bar bhikkhus in this sdsana the bhikkhu has got rid of ignorance has cut off the roots has made it like palm tree stump which will not grow again has rendered it inca pable of coming into being again and has made it impossible to arise in the future bhikkhus in this way the bhikkhu has lifted the cross bar and bhikkhus how has the bhikkhu destroyed the moat totally in this sasana bhikkhus the bhikkhu has got rid of the round of rebirth that brings about new existence has cut off the roots has made it like palm tree stump has rendered it incapable of coming into being again and has made it impossible to arise in the future bhikkhus in this way the bhikkhu has destroyed the moat totally and bhikkhus how has the bhikkhu uprooted the door post in this sésana bhikkhus the bhikkhu has got rid of craving has cut off the roots has made it like palm tree stump has rendered it incapable of coming into being again and has made it impossible to arise in the future bhikkhus in this way the bhikkhu has uprooted the door post down door it is an obstruction in opening the door to nibbana arahats have got rid of that cross bar the moat by this is meant kamméabhisaikhara kamma producing volitions leading to rebirth the door post craving like gloor post penetrating deep into the earth iit opamma vagga and bhikkhus how has the bhikkhu dismantled the door in this sasana bhikkhus the bhikkhu has got rid of the five fetters leading to rebirth in the lower sensual realms has cut off the roots has made them like palm tree stump has rendered them incapable of coming into being again and has made them impossible to arise in the future bhikkhus in this way the bhikkhu has dismantled the door and bhikkhus how has the bhikkhu come to be devoid of kilesas having taken down the flag having laid down the burden having been freed from egotistic pride bhikkhus in this sasana the bhikkhu has got rid of the conceit of ‘i’

to be devoid of kilesas having taken down the flag having laid down the burden having been freed from egotistic pride bhikkhus when the devas including inda brahma and pajapati ra search for the bhikkhu with the liberated mind they are unable to discover and to know thus “the consciousness of the being the arahat is based on this the door the five fetters that bind person to rebirth in the lower sensual realms are likened to door that closes the way to nibbana arahats have destroyed these fetters of sensual attach ment ill will false rites and rituals wrong views and doubt the flag the flag of egotistic pride the burden the burden of the aggregates khandhas defilements kilesas and kamma formations abhisankhara freed from egotistic pride visaniyutta lit unfettered unhamessed attachment to the aggregates khandhas is called asmi mana the conceit of ‘i am’ here freedom from such attachment means freedom from the notion of ‘i’ the conceit of the conceit that the five khandhas are ‘i’ self alagaddipama sutta sense object or mind object ’’ why is that so declare bhikkhus that it is because even here and now there is nothing to be called being in terms of reality bhikkhus for thus speaking for thus proclaiming have been slandered by some samanas nd brahmanas who say thus “samana gotama destroys beings and asserts the annihi lation of existent entity its destruction and its non being ”’ alleging it baselessly vainly falsely and wrongly bhikkhus do not destroy beings thus do not say thus °° therefore those worthy samanas and brahmanas slander me baselessly vainly falsely and wrongly when they say “samana gotama destroys beings and asserts the annihilation of existent entity its destruction and its non being bhihkkus in the past as well as now declare the fact of dukkha and the cessation of dukkha bhikkhus if on account of that others revile abuse blame and harass the tathagata there will be no resentment no dissatisfaction and no displeasure in the mind of the tathagata it means that the devas etc are unable to know on what the consciousness of an arahat is based because speaking in terms of absolute truth paramattha beings do not exist second interpretation is that the devas cannot comprehend if the consciousness of an arahat in the exercise of insight meditation or magga and phala is based on particular sense object or mind object it goes without saying that they are unable to know the nature of consciousness of ap arahat who has passed away in parinibbana and who thus cannot be traced do not say thus the buddha was only maintaining the non existence of being speaking in terms of absolute truth but he used the term ‘being’only in the conventional sense he did not therefore destroy beings and he did not assert the annihilation of an existent entity the death consciousness of an arahat is like the dying out’ of flame as the wick is consumed so it cannot be said that his consciousness is based on this or that sense object or mind object teaching this the buddha cannot be held to be an ucchedavadi one who puts forward the nihilistic theory there is no being to be called “lor no beings to be called “others so some samanas and brahmanas were misrepresenting the buddha ii opamma vagga bhikkhus if on account of that declaration of the fact of dukkha and its cessation others respect revere honour and venerate the tathagata there will be no joy pleasure or elation in the mind of the tathagata bhikkhus if on account of that declaration of the fact of dukkha and its cessation others respect revere honour and venerate the tathagata there arises in the tathagata this thought “these people are just doing so to this aggregate of five khandhas that have fully comprehended before ’” therefore bhikkhus if others revile abuse blame and harass you you should not be resentful and dissatisfied and displeased on account of that therefore bhikkhus if others respect revere honour and venerate you you should not be joyful pleased and elated on account of that therefore bhikkhus if others respect revere honour and venerate you you should think “these people are just doing so to this aggregate of five khandhas that have fully comprehended before the buddha did not declare the reality of existence of being but he did declare the dukkha of corporeality sensation perception volitional activilies consciousness and the cessation of dukkha as he declared so if others reviled him or held him in reverence for it he remained unruffled neither being angry when dispraised nor becoming elated when praised with the thought that they were just honouring the khandhas aggregates the nature of which he had thoroughly understood alagaddupama sutta therefore bhikkhus abandon that which is not yours abandoning that will be for

venerable sir why is that not so “it is because venerable sir the grass pieces of wood branches and leaves are neither our self atta nor our atta’s property similarly bhikkhus abandon that which is not yours abandoning that will be for your own weltare and happincss abandon that which is not yours herein the buddha was exhorting his disciples to dispel chandaraga desire and attachment that

clinging is absent however magga is still subject to antecedent factors magga and phala are subject to causes and to conditioning factors the venerable punnna’s thesis is to the effect that magga and

friends acquaintances and close relatives might ask that king who had just arrived at the inner palace gate “o great king have you come from savatthi to the palace gate in saketa by means of this chariot drawn by trained horses your reverence in what way should king pasenadi of kosala answer so that he can be said to have answered correctly “your reverence king pasenadi of kosala may be said to have answered correctly if he were to answer thus while was in savatthi had some urgent business in this city of sdketa so relay of seven chariots drawn by trained horses was arranged for me

carry the venerable punna the son of mantani on coil of cloth placed on their heads to have the chance to see him and associate with him it would be of benefit great benefit to them now that we have the chance to see and associate with the venerable punna the son of mantanji it is of benefit great benefit to us application of the simile king pasenadi of kosala signifies the yogi in meditation in dread of ageing and death his city of savatthi is the aggregate of mind and body the city of saketa stands for nibbana and his urgent mission to saketa stands for the yogi’s task of realizing the four ariya truths the relay of seven chariots represents the seven periods of time during which the yogi practises the successive stages of purity first achieving silavisuddhi purity in morality second achieving cittavisuddhi purity in mind and so on till he gains ianadassana visuddhi purity of magga knowledge and vision just as king pasenadi of kosala entered the palace gate of saketa the yogi by this last means of purity does away with kilesas and will enjoy the supramundane bliss of sustained absorption in insight fruition iii opamma vagga when this had been said the venerable punna the son of mantani asked the venerable sariputta thus “what is the name of your reverence how is your reverence known among compan ions in the practice of the dhamma’ ”’ “your reverence upatissa is my name and the compan ions in the practice of the dhamma know me as sariputta the son of sari “o sirs in conferring with the disciple who is like the teacher himself we did not indeed know that he is the venerable sariputta really had we known him before as the venerable sariputta we should not have spoken at such length wonderful your reverence extraordinary your reverence the venerable sariputta has set very profound questions point by point just as disciple well informed and well instructed in the teacher’s teaching would it is of benefit great benefit to those companions in the practice of the dhamma who have the chance to see the venerable sariputta and to associate with him and even if the companions in the practice of the dhamma have to carry the venerable sariputta on coil of cloth placed on their heads to have the chance to see him and associate with him it would be of benefit great benefit to them now that we have the chance to see the venerable sariputta and associate with him it is of benefit great benefit to us in this way these two great arahats expressed mutual joy at what each had said well to the other end of the rathavinita sutta the fourth in this vagga nivapa sutta discourse with the simile of grass raised by huntsman thus have heard at one time the bhagava was staying at the jetavana monastery of anathapindika in savatthi then the bhagava addressed the bhikkhus saying “bhikkhus those bhikkhus answered the bhagava “venerable sir ’’ and the bhagava spoke these words bhikkhus huntsman does not raise grass for herds of deer with the intention “may herds of deer enjoying this grass raised by me live long in good shape sustaining themselves for long time to come” bhikkhus huntsman raises grass for herds of deer with the intention “herds of deer will

and being care less they will be subjected to whatever the huntsman liked to do with them in this patch of grass bhikkhus among those herds of deer the first herd of deer encroached upon that patch of

morning the bhagava rearranged his robes and carrying the alms bowl and great robe entered savatthi for alms food then number of bhikkhus approached the venerable ananda and having approached spoke to the venerable ananda thus vencrable ananda it has been long time since we had heard talk on the dhamma in the presence of the bhagava it would be well venerable ananda if we get chance to hear talk on the dhamma in the presence of the bhagava if that be so your reverences go to the hermitage of brahmana rammaka there probably you would get chance to hear talk on the dhamma in the presence of the bhagava said the venerable ananda very well venerable sir said those bhikkhus to the vencrable ananda having made the rounds for alms food in savattht having had his meal and having returned from the

out of the water and stood there with his single robe on having dried his limbs then the venerable ananda said to the bhagava venerable sir the hermitage of brahmana rammaka is not far off venerable sir brahmana rammaka hermitage is delightful venerable sir brahmana rammaka hermitage is pleasing venerable sir may the bhagava out of compassion proceed towards rammaka hermitage the bhagava gave his consent by remaining silent then the bhagava proceeded towards brahmana rammaka hermitage at that time many bhikkhus in brahmana rammaka hermitage were sitting together talking about the dhamma then the bhagava stood outside the door waiting for the conversation to end and having known that it had ended coughed and tapped on the door leaf those bhikkhus opened the door for the bhagavaé then the bhagava sat down on the prepared seat in brahmana ramanaka hermitage having thus sat down he asked the bhikkhus bhikkhus what now were you talking as you are assembled here what is the unfinished interval conversation “venerable sir the unfinished conversation is about the dhamma that relates to the bhagava it was then that the bhagava came said the bhikkhus to sprinkle water over my limbs

of ageing being subjected to the nature of disease myself pursued that which has the nature of disease being subjected to the nature of death myself pursued that which has the nature of death pasarasit sutta being subjected to the nature of sorrow myself pursued that which has the nature of sorrow being subjected to the nature of defilement myself pursued that which has the nature of defilement bhikkhus it then occurred to me why do subjected to the nature of rebirth myself pursue that which has the nature of rebirth why do subjected to the nature of ageing myself pursue that which has the nature of ageing why do ‘i subjected to the nature of disease myself pursue that which has the nature of ageing why do subjected to the nature of disease myself pursue that which has the nature of disease why do subjected to the nature of death myself pursue that which has the nature of death why do subjected to the nature of sorrow pursue that which has the nature of sorrow why do subjected to the nature of defilement myself pursue that which has the nature of defilement it would be good if subjected to the nature of rebirth myself having realized the peril in the nature of rebirth were to pursue nibbana which is birthless and the incomparable state of safety free from bondage if subjected to the nature of ageing myself having realized the peril in the nature of ageing were to pursue nibbana which is free from ageing and the incomparable state of safety free from bondage if subjected to the nature of disease myself having realized the preril in the nature of disease were to pursue nibbana which is free from disease and the incomparable state of safety free from bondage if subjected to the nature of death having realized the peril in the nature of death were to

were to pursue nibbana which is free from defilement and the incomparable state of safety free from bondage iii oppamma vagga bhikkhus after time quite young possessed of luxuriant dark hair in the first period of life and in glowing youthfulness cut off my hair and beard donned the bark dyed robe while my mother and father disagreeing to my venture wept shedding tears and renounced hearth and home for the homeless life having become recluse seeking meritorious dhamma‘ in search of the incomparable state of perfect peace approached ara of kalama clan having approached alara of kalama clan said to him thus friend kalama desire to take up the noble practice in this doctrine and discipline bhikkhus when said so alara of kalama clan spoke to me thus “may the revered one stay here this dhamma enables an intelligent person to realize soon by his own intuitive knowledge and attain and dwell in the dhamma as taught by his teacher soon bhikkhus learned that dhamma very quickly then bhikkhus was able to say that knew and affirmed what knew by just repeating the master words so soon as they were uttered by mere movement of his lips myself professed possession of knowledge and vision others also confirmed this then bhikkhus it occurred to me thus dra of kalama clan had not said simply out of his own belief that he had realized by his own intuitive knowledge and attained and dwelt in this dhamma certainly alara of kalama clan had attained and dwelt in this dhamma having known and seen it then bhikkhus approached ara of kalama clan and said to him friend kalama to what extent do you claim that you have realized by your own intuitive knowl edge and attained and dwelt in this dhamma bhikkhus when said so alara of kalama clan professed attainment of the akificafifiayatana jhana then again bhikkhus it occurred to me thus not only has alara of kalama clan conviction also have conviction not only has al ara of seeking meritorious dhamma kimkusalagavesi in search of that dhamma which is absolutely blameless and which icads to liberation from the cycle of rebirths pasarasi sutta kalama clan energy also have energy not only has alara of kalama clan

efforts to realize the dhamma which ara of kalama clan has claimed saying ‘i have realized by my own intuitive knowledge and attained and dwelt in that dhamma soon bhikkhus very quickly realized by my own intuitive knowledge attained and dwelt in that dhamma bhikkhus then approached ara of kalama clan having approached said to him friend kalama do you elaim to this extent that you have realized by your own intuitive knowledge and attained this dhamma “friend do claim that to this extent have realized by my own intuitive knowledge and attained this dhamma” then said “friend too to this extent have realized by my own intuitive knowledge attained and dwelt in this dhamma” “friend said ara it is gain to us it is well gotten for us to have found in your reverence companion in the noble

have realized by my own intuitive knowledge and to have attained that dhamma which yoy have realized by your own intuitive knowledge and which you have attained and dwelt thus you know the dhamma that know and know the dhamma that you know thus you are as am and so am tas you are come triend now the two of us will lead this proup bhikkhus in this way alara of kalama clan made me his coequal although he was my teacher and his pupil iii oppamma vagga he also honoured me with the highest honour then bhikkhus it occurred to me thus this dhamma is not for weariness of life not for non attachment not for ihe cessation of dukkha not for tranquillity not for higher knowledge not for enlightenment not for the realization of nibbana it conduces only to reaching the realm of akificafifiayatana not cherishing that dhamma at all turned away from it in disgust then bhikkhus seeking the meritorious dhammas and in search of nibbana the incomparable state of perfect peace approached udaka rama son having approached said to udaka rama’s son friend desire to take up the noble practice in this doctrine and discipline “bhikkhus when said so udaka rama son spoke to me thus may the revered one stay here this dhamma enables an intelligent person to realize soon by his own intuitive knowledge and attain and dwell in the dhamma as taught by his teacher soon bhikkhus learned that dhamma very quickly then bhikkhus was able to say that knew and affirmed what knew by just repeating the master words so soon as they were uttered by mere movement of his lips myself professed

attained and dwelt in this dhamma certainly rama ‘had attained and dwelt in this dhamma having known and seen it then bhikkhus approched udaka rama son having approached said to him “friend to what extent did rama proclaim he had realized by his own intuitive knowledge attained and dwelt in this dhamma ’” bhikkhus when said so udaka rama son professed attainment of the nevasannanasannayatana jhana then again bhikkhus it occurred to me thus “not only has rama conviction also have conviction not only has rama energy also have péphriai sutias energy not only has rama mindfulness also have mindfulness not only has rama concentration also have concentration not only has rama wisdom also have wisdom it would be good if were to make the effort to realize the dhamma which rama has claimed saying ‘i have realized by my own intuitive knowledge and attained and dwelt in this dhamma soon bhikkhus very quickly realized by my own intuitive knowledge and attained and dwelt in that dhamma bhikkhus then approached udaka rama’s son having approached said to him “does rama claim to this extent that he has realized by his own intuitive knowledge attained and dwelt in this dhamma ”’ “friend rama claimed to this extent that he had realized by his own intuitive knowledge and attained and dwelt in this dhamma then said “friend too to this extent have realized by my own intuitive knowledge

dhamma that you know thus you are as rama was and so was rama as you are come friend now will you please lead this group bhikkhus in this way udaka rama son being my companion in the noble practice set me in the position of teacher he also honoured me with the highest honour then oppamma vagga bhikkhus it occurred to me thus “this dhamma is not for weariness of life not for non attachment not for cessation of dukkha not for tranquillity not foi higher knowledge not for the enlightenment not for the realization of nibbana it conduces only to reaching the realm of nevasanfana sannayatana not cherishing that dhamma at all turned away from it in disgust bhikkhus seeking the meritorious dhammas and in search of nibbana the incomparable state of perfect peace set out on tour through the country of magadha travelling by stages and arrived at the market town of sena near uruvela froest there found delightful stretch of land pleasant forest grove flowing river delightful with tidy landing places and village for seeking alms food in the vicinity then bhikkhus it occurred to me thus indeed here is delightful stretch of land pleasant forest grove flowing river delightful with tidy landing places and village for seeking alms food in the vicinity this place is appropriate for man of good family desiring to meditate to go into meditation then bhikkhus sat in that very place thinking this place is appropriate for taking up meditation” bhikkhus as being subjected to the nature of rebirth myself but having come to know the peril in the nature of rebirth pursued nibbana which is birthless and is the incomparable state of safety free from bondage realized nibbana which is birthless and is the incomparable state of safety free from bondage as being subjected to the nature of ageing but having come to know the peril in the nature of ageing pursued nibbana which is free from ageing and is the incomparable state of safety free from bondage realized nibbana which is free from ageing and is the incomparable state of safety free from bondage as being subjected to the nature of disease but having come to know the peril in the nature of disease pursued nibbana which is free from disease and is the incomparable state of safety free pasarasi sutta from bondage realized nibbana which is free from disease and is the incomparable state of safety free from bondage as being subjected to the nature of death but having come to know the peril in the nature of death pursued nibbana which is the deathless and is the incomparable state of safety free from bondage realized nibbana which is deathless and is the incomparable state of safety free from bondage as being subjected to the sorrow but having come to know the peril in the nature of sorrow pursued nibbana which is free from sorrow and is the incomparable state of safety free from bondage realized nibbana which is free from sorrow and the incomparable state of safety free from bondage as being subjected to the nature of defilement but having come to know the peril in the nature of defilement pursued nibbana which is free from defilement and is the incomparable state of satety free from bondage realized nibbana which is free from defilement and is the incomparable state of safety free from bondage then there arose in me knowledge my liberation arahatship is indestructible this is my last rebirth for me there is no renewed existence thus there arose the reflective knowledge bhikkhus then it occurred to me thus this dhamma that have known is profound difficult to see difficult to comprehend tranquil noble surpassing logic subtle intelligible only to the wise these beings delight in sensual pleasure find happiness in sensual pleasures and rejoice in sensual pleasures these beings who delight in sensual pleas ures who find happiness in sensual pleasures and who rejgice in sensual pleasures will find it difficult to perceive this doctrine of cause and effect paticcasamuppada and also this dhamma nibbana which is the calming of all conditioning activities the giving up of all substrata of existence the extinction of craving the absence of attachment and the cessation of dukkha were to proclaim the dhamma while others were unable to understand it that would weary me and cause me fatigue iti oppamma vagga then bhikkhus these marvellous verses never heard of before came to my mind it is not proper now for me to proclaim the dhamma attained by me with difficulty for those obsessed with attachment and hatred it will be difficult to understand deep dyed in lust and enveloped in darkness they will not be able to see the dhamma subtle profound and like unto tiny atom not easily visible that runs against the tide of samsara cycle of existence bhikkhus as reflected in this way my mind was inclined to remain unconcerned and not to teach the dhamma then bhikkhus brahma sahampati knowing my mind with his mind thought thus “o friends the world is lost the world is utterly lost because the mind of the tathagata worthy of special veneration perfectly self enlightened is inclined to remain unconcerned and not to teach the dhamma then bhikkhus just as strong man stretches out his bent arm or bends his stretched arm so also the brahma sahampati vanishing from the brahma world made himself manifest before me then bhikkhus the brahma sahampati placing his outer robe on one shoulder and raising his joined palms towards me spoke thus to me “venerable sir may the bhagava be pleased to reveal the dhamma may the sugata be pleased to preach the dhamma there are beings with little dust of defilement in their eyes of wisdom they are losing for not hearing the dhamma there will be those who understand the dhamma bhikkhus brahma sahampati spoke those words having said those words he spoke to me again thus ‘in times past there appeared in the country of magadha an impure doctrine of wrong views thought out by persons with tainted mind open the door of deathlessness nibbana let beings hear the dhamma of the four ariya truths realized by the taintless one pasarasi sutta iii perfectly wise one and possessor of the all secing ye ven as one might stand on the crest of mountain and observe the humanity below and all around so may it please you venerable sir released from sorrow mount the tower of knowledge of the dhamma and take look at beings fallen into gricf under the oppressive weight of rebirth and ageing arise victorious one and triumphant warrior like unto caravan leader one free from the dust of defilements journey round the world may the bhagava reveal the dhamma there will be those who understand it and then bhikkhus having understood the brahma entreaty and having compassion for sentient beings surveyed the world with the buddha eye® as surveyed the world with the buddha eye saw beings with little dust of defilement in their eyes of wisdom with much dust of defilement in their eyes of wisdom with acuteness or dullness in their intuitive faculties with good or bad intuitive capacities easy or difficult to teach and some beings who dwell seeing danger in the fault of the other world and some besides physical eye mantsacakkhu there is the eye of wisdom consisting of buddhacakkhu buddha cye or the eye of the enlightened one which discriminates between acuteness and dullness of intuition indriyaparopayatinaga and which under stands the disposition of beings asayanusaya ana samantacakkhu synonymous with sabbafiuta haga omniscience dhammacakkhu knowledge of the lower three pairs of magga and phala dibbacakkhu the divine eye ec pahiadcakkhu the eye of wisdom or arahattaphaladaga intuitive capacities the five aspects of the moral qualities of faith energy mindfulness concentration and knowledge oppamma vagga beings who do not see the fault of the other world for example among the clump of uppala lotus or of paduma lotus or of pundarika lotus in pond some lotus plants that germinate under water develop in the water do not rise above the water and grow submerged in the water some others germinate underwater develop in the water and come up level with the surface of the water yet others germinate underwater develop in the water and rise above the surface of the water unmoistened with water similarly bhikkhus as surveyed the world with the buddha eye saw some beings with little dust of defilement in their eyes of wisdom with much dust of defilement in their eyes of widom with acuteness or dullness in their intuitive faculties with good or bad intuitive capacities easy or difficult to teach and some beings who see the fault of the other world and some beings who do not see the fault of the other world then bhikkhus said to brahma sahampati in verse brahma thinking that it would only make me weary to teach the sublime dhamma which had mastered had been disinclined to teach it now let those with ears of wisdom give forth their faith have opened the door of deathlessness nibbana for them then bhikkhus knowing that the bhagava has deigned to expound the dhamma brahma sahampati paid homage to the bhagava and keeping the bhagava on his right side vanished at that very place then bhikkhus thought “to whom should expound the dhamma first who will understand this dhamma quickly then again bhikkhus it occurred to me indeed this alara of kalama clan is wise clever and intelligent this thought occurred on the eighth week after the ealightenment wise because ajara had become endowed with the seven attainments intelligent because he had sharp knowledpe of things pasarasi sutta idf and has little dust of defilement in his eyes of wisdom since long time it would be well if were to expound the dhamma first to alara of kalama clan he will understand this dhamma quickly then bhikkhus deva approached me and said “venerable sir it is seven days since ara of kalama clan has passed away at the same time knowledge and vision also arose in me thus “alara of kalama clan passed away seven days ago then bhikkhus thought ara of kalama clan has suffered great loss for had he heard this dhamma he would have understood it quickly then again bhikkhus thought “to whom should expound the dhamma first who will understand this dhamma quickly then again bhikkhus it occurred to me “udaka rama son is wise clever and intelligent and has little dust of defilement in his eye of wisdom since long time it would be well if were to expound the dhamma first to udaka rama son he will understand this dhamma quickly then bhikkhus deva approached me and said “venerable sir it was only last night that udaka rama son passed away at the same time knowledge and vision also arose in me thus “udaka rama son passed away last night then bhikkhus thought “udaka rama son has suffered great loss for had he heard this dhamma he would have understood it quickly bhikkhus it again occurred to me thus “to whom should expound the dhamma first who will understand this dhamma quickly and again thought the group of five bhikkhus had been of great service to me they served me during the litthe dust in his eyes because he had got rid of kilesa by means of attainment of jhana lt ajara could have attained magga aod phala within seven days after hearing the dhamma now he had lost this opportunity iii oppamma vagga course of the great endeavour it would be well if were to expound the dhamma first to the group of five bhikkhus “and reflected where is the group of five bhikkhus residing now then bhikkhus with my divine eye extremely clear surpassing the sight of men saw the group of five bhikkhus staying at the deer park known as isipatana near the city of baranasi bhikkhus having stayed in the forest grove of uruvela for as long as it delighted me set out on tour for baranasi then bhikkhus upaka naked ascetic saw me taking the long journey between gaya and bodhi the tree of enlightenment having seen me he said to me thus “friend your faculties are extremely clear your complexion is pure and clean referring to whom as your teacher have you gone forth who is your teacher whose dhamma pleases you when this had been said spoke in verses to upaka the ascetic thus upaka have overcome everything have known everything have kept myself untainted with defilement with regard to all dhammas have renounced all my mind has inclined to nibbana where craving is extinct having known all dhammas myself with special apperception whom should point to as my teacher upaka have no teacher there is none to equal me there is none to rival me in this world with its devas am an arahat and the incomparable teacher in the world am the only one who is perfectly padhanapahitatta the great endeavour in the exercise of meditation with the great resolve to realize the truth the distance between bodhi and gaya is three gavuttas and that between bodhi and baranasi is eighteen yojanas all the dhammas the mundane dhammas belonging to the three forms of existence pasarasi sutta iis self enlightened having extinguished all the defilements am tranquil to turn the wheel of dhamma am going to the city of kasi intending to beat the drum of deathlessness in world that is blind “if it is friend said upaka “as you profess yourself to be you deserve to be the possessor of infinite wisdom victor of the five maras then the buddha uttered this stanza men like me who have come to the extinction of asavas are indeed victors victor am upaka since have conquered all evil demeritorious dhammas when this had been said bhikkhus upaka the naked ascetic saying “it may be so nodded his head and departed taking different road then bhikkhus travelling by stages approached the deer park known as isipatana near baranasi where the group of five bhikkhus were staying bhikkhus the group of five bhikkhus saw me coming at distance having seen me they made an aggrement among themselves saying “friends this samana cotama is seeking abundant gains turning away from the great endeavour he is roaming about places for the sake of abundance he should not be greeted with respect he should not be welcomed by rising to our feet his bowl and robe should not be taken but seat should be set aside for him if he wants to sit he may do so bhikkhus when drew near them they were unable to keep their own agreement some got up and took my bowl and robe some prepared the seat and some rought me water to wash my feet but they addressed me by name gotama and by the term aavuso when this was said thus spoke to the group of five bhikkhus thus ‘“bhikkhus do not address the tathagata by iii oppamma vagga name and by the term vuso friend bhikkhus the tathagata is one who is worthy of special veneration and is the perfectly self enlightented give ears bhikkhus have attained the deathless will instruct you and teach the dhamma if you practise according to my instruction and teaching you will soon realize by your own intuitive knowledge here and now and attain and dwell in the dhamma which is the ultimate goal of the noble practice for which sons of good families rightly go forth from home into homelss life bhikkhus when had said this to the group of five bhikkhus they spoke to me thus friend gotama you have not attained the special knowledge and insight that enables one to become an ariya and that transcends the dhamma practised by ordinary human beings even by such effort by such practice and by such difficult methods seeking abundant gains now after having turned away from the great endeavour and roaming about places for the sake of abundance how can you attain the special knowledge and insight that enables one to become an ariya and that transcends the dhamma practised by ordinary human being bhikkhus when this was said spoke to the group or five bhikkhus bhikkhus the tathagata does not seek to gain abundance neither did he turn away from the great endeavour nor does he roam about places for the sake of abundance the tathagata is one who is worthy of special veneration is perfectly self enlightened give ears bhikkhus have attained the deathless shall instruct you and teach the dhamma if you practise according to my instruction and teaching you will soon realize by your own intuitive knowledge here and now and attain and dwell in the dhamma which is the ultimate goal of the noble practice for which sons of good families rightly go forth from home into homeless life bhikkhus for the second time too the group of five bhikkhus spoke to me thus “friend gotama you have not attained the special knowledge and insight that enables one to pasarasi sutta become an ariya and that transcends the dhamma practised by ordinary human being even by such effort by such practice and by such difficult methods seeking abundant gains now after having turned away from the great endeavour and roaming about places for the sake of abundance how can you attain the special knowledge and insight that enables one to become an ariya and that transcends the dhamma practised by ordinary human beings and for the second time too bhikkhus spoke to the group of five bhikkhus bhikkhus the tathagata does not seek to gain abundance you will attain and dwell in the dhamma bhikkhus for the third time too the group of five bhikkhus spoke to me thus “friend gotama you have not attained the special knowledge and insight that enables one to become an ariya and that transcends the dhamma practised by ordinary human beings even by such effort by such practice and by difficult methods seeking abundant gains now after having turned away from the great endeavour and roaming about places for the sake of abundance how can you attain the special knowledge and insight that enables one to become an ariyd and that transcends the dhamma practised by ordi nary human beings as this had been said spoke to the group of five bhikkhus thus “do you remember that ever spoke to you such kind of words before “no we do not venerable sir said the group of five bhikkhus bhikkhus the tathagata is one who is worthy of special veneration and is perfectly self enlightened give cars bhikkhus have attained the deathless will instruct you and teach the dhamma if you practise according to my instruction you will soon realize by your own intuitive knowledge here and now and attain and dwell in the dhamma which is the ultimate goal of the noble practice for which sons of good families rightly go ‘forth from home into the homeless life iii oppamma vagga then bhikkhus was able to convince the group of five bhikkhus and bhikkhus exhorted two bhikkhus while three bhikkhus went the rounds for alms food whatever alms food the three bhikkhus collected the group of six subsisted on it bhikkhus exhorted three bhikkhus while two bhikkhus went the rounds for alms food whatever alms food the two bhikkhus collected the group of six subsisted on it then bhikkhus being thus exhorted and instructed by me the group of five bhikkhus being subjected to the nature of rebirth themelves and having known the peril in the nature of rebirth they pursued nibbana which is birthless and is the incomparable state of safety free from bondage and they realized nibbana which is birthless and is the incomparable state of safety free from bondage being subjected to the nature of ageing themselve and having known the peril in the nature of ageing they pursued nibbana which is free from ageing and is the incomparable state of safety free from bondage and they realized nibbana which is free from ageing and is the incomparable state of safety free from bondage being subjected to the nature of disease themselves being subjected to the nature of death themselves being subjected to the nature of sorrow themselves being subjected to the nature of defilement themselves and having known the peril in the nature of defilement they pursued nibbana which is free ftom defilement and which is the incomparable state of safety free from bondage and they realized nibbana which is free from defilement and which is the incomparable state of safety free from bondage there arose the reflective knowledge in those bhikkhus thus “our liberation arahatship is indestructible this is our last rebirth for us there is no renewed existence bhikkhus there are these five kinds of sense pleasure and what are the five they are visible objects cognizable by eye consciousness desirable delightful pleasing pasarasi sutta alluring accompanied by sensual attachment and enticing sounds cognizable by ear consciousness smells cognizable by nose consciousness tastes cognizable by tongue consciousness and physical contact congnizable by body consciousness desirable delightful pleasing alluring accompanied by sensual attachment and enticing bhikkhus these are the five kinds of sense pleasure bhikkhus those samanas and brahmanas who enjoy the five kinds of sense pleasure with greed with bewilderment with strong attachment without seeing the fault and without knowledge of escape should be known thus “they have fallen into misfortune they have fallen into ruin they are subjected to whatever the evil one wishes to do bhikkhus for instance if deer living in the forest were to fall into sleep on heap of snares in which he was caught he should be known thus he has fallen into misfortune he has fallen into ruin he is subjected to whatever the hunter wishes to do when the hunter came he would not be able to get away even so those samanas and brahamanas who enjoy the five kinds of sense pleasure with greed with bewilderment with strong attachment without seeing the fault and without knowledge of escape should be known thus they have fallen into misfortune they have fallen into ruin they are subjected to whatever the evil one wishes to do bhikkhus those samanas and brahmanas who enjoy these five kinds of sense pleasure without greed without bewilderment and without strong attachment seeing the fault arid knowing the way of escape should be known thus “they have not fallen into misfortune they have not fallen into ruin they are not subjected to whatever the evil one wishes to do bhikkhus for instance if deer living in the forest were to fall into sleep on heap of snares in which he was not caught he should be known thus he has not fallen into iii opamma vagga misfortune he has not fallen into ruin he is not subjected to whatever the hunter wishes to do when the hunter came he would be able to get away even so those samanas and brahmanas who enjoy these five kinds of sense pleasure without greed without bewilderment without strong attachment seeing the fault and knowing the way of escape should be known thus they have not fallen into misfortune they have not fallen into ruin they are not subjected to whatever the evil one wishes to do bhikkhus for instance deer living in deep forest might roam about in it without any fear as he stands up or sits down or falls into sleep why is it so it is because bhikkhus he is out of sight of the huntsman bhikkhus similarly the bhikkhu being detached from sensual pleasures and being detached from demeritorious factors achieves and remains in the first jhana which has vitakka and vicadra and which has piti and sukha born of detachment from hindrances nivaranas bhikkhus this bhikkhu is said to be one who has made the evil one blind and having blotted out the evil one’s vision has gone out of sight of the evil one and again bhikkhus having got rid of vitakka and vicara the bhikkhu achieves and remains in the second jhana with internal tranquillity with enhancement of one pointedness of mind devoid of vitakka and vicdra but with piti and sukha born of concentration bhikkhus this bhikkhu is said to be has gone out of sight of the evil one and again bhikkhus the bhikkhu having been de tached from piti as well dwells in equanimity with mindfulness and clear comprehension and experiences sukha in mind and body that bhikkhu achieves and remains in the third jhana for which the ariyas praise him as one who abides in happiness possessed of equanimity and mindfulness bhikkhus this bhikkhu is said to be has gone out of sight of the evil one pasarasi sutta and again bhikkhus the bhikkhu by dispelling both pleasure and pain and by the previous disappearance of gladness and sadness achicves and remains in the fourth jhana which has neither pain nor pleasure but has purity of mindfulness born of equanimity bhikkhus this bhikkhu is said to be has gone out of sight of the evil one and again bhikkhus the bhikkhu with complete transcending of rupasanna with the disappearance of patigha sanna with non attention to nanatasanna and with concentra tion on the concept “space is infinite achieves and remains in the akasdnaficayatana jhana bhikkhus this bhikkkhu is said to be has gone out of sight of the evil one and again bhikkhus the bhikkhu completely passing beyond the akasdnaficayatana jhana and concentrating on the concept “consciousness is infinite’ achieves and remains in the vinnhanaficayatana jhana bhikkhus this bhikkhu is said to be has gone out of sight of the evil one and again bhikkhus the bhikkhu completely passing beyond the vinnanaficayatana jhana and concentrating on the concept “nothing is there achieves and remains in the akifcaiiidyatana jhana bhikkhus this bhikkhu is said to be vp has gone out of sight of the evil one and again bhikkhus the bhikkhu completely passing beyond the akificafifidyatana jhana achieves and remains in the nevasaifanasannayatana jhana bhikkhus this bhikkhu is said to be has gone out of sight of the evil one and again bhikkhus the bhikkhu completely passing beyond the nevasannanasannayatana jhana achieves and remains in the cessation of perception and sensations having seen the truth through wisdom the asavas in him become extinct bhikkhus this bhikkhu is said to be one who has made the evil one blind and having blotted out the evil one vision has gone out of sight of the vil one that bhikkhu has crossed over intense craving or clinging to sense objects he now walks fearlessly stands oppamma vagga fearlessly sits fearlessly and sleeps fearlessly why is it so it is bhikkhus because he has gone out of sight of the evil one mara thus spoke the bhagava delighted these bhikkhus rejoiced in what the bhagava had said end of pasarasi sutta the sixth in this vagga colahatthipadopama sutta the lesser discourse on the elephant footprint simile thus have heard once the bhagava was dwelling at the jetavana mon astery of anathapindika in savatthi at that time the brahmin janusoni came out of savatthi at noontime in chariot drawn by all white mares then he saw pilotika the wander ing ascetic coming from afar and he said to pilotika the wandering ascetic “friend vacchayana where have you come from at this noontime “friend have come from the presence of samana gotama “friend what do you think of the depth of samana gotama’s wisdom do you regard him as wise man “friend what kind of man am what kind of man am to be able to know the depth of samana gotama’s vicchayana pilotika the wandering ascetic was member of the viccha clan hence he was called vicchayana culfahatthipadoma sutta wisdom anyone who kaows the depth of samana gotama’s wisdom must be someone who is of like wisdom as samana gotama “friend you praise samana gotama highly “friend what kind of man am being what kind of person should be able to praise samana gotama that revered gotama deserves praise only in praiseworthy terms he is superior to devas and men “friend for what reason does the revered vaccayana adore samana gotama so much “just as friend an intelligent man living in the land of elephants were to see big elephant footprint which is long and broad he would conclude that it was indeed huge elephant so also since the time saw the four marks of knowledge in samana gotama have arrived at the conclusion that the bhagava is the perfectly self enlightened one that the dhamma is well proclaimed by the bhagavad and that the sanigha the oredr of the disciples of the bhagava is endowed with right practice what are the four marks of knowledge friend in this world have seen some wise rulers of the ruling class who have abstruse knowledge who are familiar with other doctrines and who are like the archers that can shoot an arrow right through mair they go about apparently destroying other beliefs by means of their knowledge friend when they heard thus “samana gotama is coming to such and such village or market town they devised question saying “we shall approach samana gotama and pose this question if being asked by us thus he answers thus we will then reprove him thus on being asked by us thus if he answers like that then we will reprove him in that way on hearing thus “samana gotama has come to such and such village or market town they approached him then samana gotama instructed exhorted roused and gladdened them with talk on the dhamma on being instructed iii oppamma vagga exhorted roused and gladdened by samana gotama with talk on the dhamma they did not even pose their question to samana gotama let alone reprove him in fact they became the disciples of samana gotama friend since the time saw this first mark of knowl edge in samana gotama have come to the conclusion that the bhagavad is the perfectly self enlightened one that the dhamma is well proclaimed by the bhagava that the sani gha the order of the disciples of the bhagava is endowed with right practice again friend have seen in this world some wise brahmins some wise householders some wise samanas who have abstruse knowledge who are familiar with other doctrines and who are like the archers that can shoot an arrow right through hair they go about apparently destroying other beliefs by means of thcir knowledge friends when they heard thus “samana gotama is coming to such and such village or market town” they devised question saying “we shall approach samana gotama and pose this question on being asked by us he answers thus we will then reprove him thus on being asked by us thus he answers like that then we reprove him in that way on hearing thus

roused and gladdened by the samana gotama with talk on dhamma they did not even pose their question to samana gotama let alone criticize him in fact they asked samana gotama for permission to leave household life and enter the homeless life samana gotama admitted them into the order they became bhikkhus in the order and dwelling in seclusion vigilant and diligent and directing their mind to nibbdna soon realized by themselves in this very life through magga culahatthipadopama sutta insight abifina they attained and abided in the fruit of the noblest and supreme arahatship which is the ultimate goal of the noble practice for which sons of good families rightly renounce hearth and home to lead the homeless life they say “friends we were close to spiritual disas ter we came close to missing our spiritual goal as matter of fact formerly we claimed to be samanas without being samanas we claimed to be brahmanas without being brahmanas we claimed to be arahats without being arahats only now we are samanas only now we are brahmanas only now we are arahats friend since the time saw this fourth mark of knowledge in samana gotama have arrived at the conclu sion that the bhagava is the perfectly self enlightened one that the dhamma is well proclaimed by the bhagava and that the sanigha the order of the disciples of the bhagava is endowed with the right practice friend since the time saw these four marks of knowledge in samana gotama have arrived at the conclu sion that the bhagava is the perfectly self enlightened one that the dhamma is well proclaimed by the bhagava and that the sanigha the order of the disciples of the bhagava is endowed with the right practice when pilotika the wandering ascetic spoke thus the brahmin janussoni got down from the chariot drawn by all white mares and putting his upper robe on one shoulder he raised his joined palms towards the direction of the bhagava and uttered thrice these words of joy “veneration to the exalted one the homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened veneration to the exalted one the homage worthy the perfectly self enlightened veneration to the exalted one the homage worthy the perfectly self nlightened iii oppamma vagga “perhaps at one time or the other we may meet with that samana gotama perhaps we may have some conversation with him later on the brahmin janussoni approached the bhagava and engaged in mutually pleasing words of greeting with the bhagava after bringing to an end the glad and courteous words of greeting he sat in suitable place and recounted to the bhagava all the conversations that he had with pilotika the wandering ascetic thereupon the bhagavad said “brahmin by this much the simile of the elephant foot print is not complete in detail listen to the discourse whereby the simile of the elephent’s foot print is made complete in detail bear it well in mind shall speak “very well venerable sir replied the brahmin janussoni the bhagava spoke thus just as brahmin man living in the land of elephants might enter the forest and might see big el ephant footprint which is long and broad but one who lives in the land of elephants and who is well versed in elephant lore does not conclude on the face of it that it is big bull elephant why is it so because brahmin there were dwarfish vamanika cow elephants that have big footprints and the footprint he saw might be one of those of the cow elephants he follows the track steadily then he might see in the forest large elephant footprint which is long and broad and marks of rubbing with the tusks at some high points but one who lives in the land of elephants and who is well versed in elephant lore does not conclude on the face of it that it is big bull elephant why is it so because brahmin there were long legged uccaka arika cow elephants that have big footprints and tusks that are far apart and the footprint he saw might be one of those of the female elephants cu ahatthipadopama sutta he follows the track steadily then he might see in the forest large elephant footprint which is long and broad and marks of rubbing and that of thrusting and scratching with the tusks at some high points but one who lives in the land of elephants and who is well versed in elephant lore does not conclude on the face of it that it is big bull elephant why is it so because brahmin there were uccakaneruka cow elephants that have big footprints long legs and tusks like slightly opened flower bud and the footprint he saw might be one of those of the cow elephants he follows the track steadily then he might see in the forest big elephant footprint which is long and broad and marks of rubbing thrusting and scratching with tusks and broken twigs at some high points he might also see that bull elephant at the foot of tree or on the plain walking standing crouching or sleeping he might then conclude that that bull was the great elephant which he had been tracking in the same way brahmin there arises in this world the tathagata who is worthy of special veneration who truly comprehends all dhammas by his own intellect and insight who possesses penetrative knowledge and perfect practice of morality who speaks only what is beneficial and true who knows all the three worlds who is incomparable in taming those who deserve to be tamed who is the teacher of devas and men who is the enlightened one knowing and teaching the four ariya truths and who is the most exalted through special apperception he personally realizes the world comprising devas madras and brahmas and also the world of human beings with its samanas and brahmanas kings samutideva and men and knowing it he expounds on it he proclaims the dhamma which is excellent at the beginning excellent at the middle and excellent at the end with richness in meaning and words he reveals the noble practice which is complete in all aspects and is absolutely pure oppamma vagga householder or his son or anyone belonging to any family listens to that dhamma on hearing the dhamma he develops faith in the tathagata when faith is thus developed he considers thus “confined is the life of householder it is path laden with dust of defilement samana life is like an open plain difficult it is for layman to pursue the noble practice in all its fullness in all its purity like polished conch now it were better for me to shave off my hair and beard don the bark dyed robe renounce hearth and home and become recluse leading the homeless life “afterwards he gives up his mass of wealth great or small leaving his circle of relatives be they few or be they many shaves off his hair and beard dons the bark dyed robe renounces hearth and home and becomes recluse leading the homeless life’ after thus becoming bhikkhu he observes the morality and precept required of bhikkhu he abandons all thoughts of taking life and abstains from destroying life setting aside the stick and the sword being ashamed to do evil and being

the practice of layfolks he abandons all thoughts of lying and abstains from telling lies speaking only the truth never swerving and remaining steadfast in truth trustworthy and not deceiving anyone in the world he abandans all thoughts of slandering and abstains from slander what he hears from this man he does not relate to that man to sow the seed of discord between them nor cufahatthipadopama

means of bribery deception and fraud he abstains from maiming murdering holding persons in captivity committing highway robbery plundering villages and committing dacoity that bhikkhu is contented with robes just sufficient to protect his body and with alms food just sufficient to maintain his stomach wherever he goes he goes only taking his requisites just as winged bird wherever it flies files only with its burden of wings so also the bhikkhu is contented with robes just sufficient to protect his body and with alms food just sufficient to maintain his stomach wherever he goes that bhikkhu goes only taking his requisites that bhikkhu possessing this noble group of moral precept enjoys within himself happiness that is free from blame on seeing visible object with the eyes that bhikkhu does not take in its characteristics such as male female nor its secondary details such as expression behaviour if the faculty of sight is left ungarded such evil demeritorious dhammas as covetousness and dissatisfaction stemming from that would overpower him as he fails to control his eye faculty so he sets himself to the task of guarding his faculty of sight keeps watch on it and gains control over it on hearing sound with the ear smelling an odour with the nose tasting flavour with the tongue contacting tangible object with the body cognizing the mind object with the mind he does not take in the characteristic such as pleasing or unpleasing nor its secondary details cdlahatthipadopama sutta if the faculty of mind is left unguarded such evil demeritorious dhamma as covetousness and dissatisfaction stemming from that would overpower him as he fails to contorl his mind faculty so he sets himself to the task of guarding his faculty of mind keeps watch on it and

aware in moving forward or back keeps himself completely aware in looking forwards or sidesways keeps himself completely aware in bending or stretching his limbs keeps himself completely aware in carrying or wearjng the great robe double layered robe alms bow and the other two robes keeps himself completely aware in eating drink ing chewing and savouring food and beverages keeps himself completely aware in urinating and defecating keeps himself completely aware in walking standing sitting falling asleep waking speaking and observing silence that bhikkhu endowed with this noble group of moral precepts endowed with this noble self control en dowed with this noble mindfulness and endowed with clear comprehension and resorts to lonely place such as forest the foot of tree hill side gully mountain cave cemetery thicket an open plain heap of strav after having had his meal he returned from the place of alms gathering he sits down cross legged and upright and establishes mindfulness in meditation then that bhikkhu dissociates himself from coveting the world the five aggregates which are the objects of clinging and abides with his mind free from covetousness thereby cleansing his mind of covetousness altogether he dissociates himself from ill will abides with his mind free from ill will and develops goodwill towards all living beings thereby cleansing his mind of ill will altogether he disso ciates himself from sloth and torpor abides with his mind iii opamma vagga free from sloth and torpor with perception of light mindfulness of comprehension thereby cleansing his mind of sloth and torpor altogether he dissociates himself from restlessness and worry and being undistracted he abides with inner peace of mind thereby cleansing his mind of restlessness and worry altogether he dissociates himself from doubt and having overcome doubt he abides without wavering in meritorious dhamma thereby cleansing his mind of doubt altogether that bhikkhu having got rid of these five hindrances nivaranas that defile the mind and that weaken wisdom and being detached from sensual pleasures and being detached from demeritorious factors that bhikkhu acheives and remains in the first jhana which has vitakka and vicara and which has piti and sukha born of detachment from the hindrances nivaranas brahmin this first jhana is said to be the tathagata footprint knowledge the tathagata mark of rubbing with knowledge and the tathagata thrusting and scratching with the tusk of knowledge but just by this much the ariyan disciple of the bhagava does not come to the conclusion that the bhagava is the perfectly self enlightened one that the dhamma is well proclaimed by the bhagava that the sam gha the order of the disciples of the bhagava is endowed with right practice and again brahmin having got rid of vitakka and vicara the bhikkhu achieves and remains in the second jhana with internal tranquillity with enhancement of one pointedness of mind devoid of vitakka and vicara but with piti and sukha born of concentration brahmin this second jhana also is said the sami gha the order of the disciples of the bhagava is endowed with right practice and again brahmin the bhikkhu having been detached from pili as well dwells in equanimity with mindfulness and clear comprehension and experiences sukha in mind and culashatthipadopama sutta body that bhikkhu achieves and remains in the third jhana for which the ariyas praise him as one who abides in happiness possessed of equanimity and mindfulness brahmin this third jhana also is said the sam gha the order of the disciples of the bhagava is endowed with the right practice and again brahmin that bhikkhu by dispelling both pleasure and pain and by the previous disappearance of gladness and sadness achieves and remains in the fourth jhana which has neither pain nor pleasure but has purity of mindfulness born of equanimity brahmin this fourth jhana also is said to be the tathagata footprint of knowledge the tathagata marks of rubbing with knowledge and the tathagata thrusting and scratching with the tusk of knowledge but just by this much the ariyan disciple of the bhagav does not come to the conclusion that the bhagava is the perfectly self enlightened one that the dhamma is well proclaimed by the bhagava that the sanigha the order of the

this way he recollects his many and varied past existences together with characteristics and related facts such as names and clans brahmin this knowledge of past existences pubbenivadsanussatifiana also is said to be the tathagata’s footprint mark of knowledge the tathagata marks of rubbing with application of the knowledge and the tathagata marks thrusting and scratching with the tusk of knowledge but just by this much the ariyan disciple of the iii opamma vagga bhagava does not come to the conclusion that the bhagava is the perfectly self enlightened one that the dhamma is well

beings with dibbacakkhu fiana the psychic power of divine sight which is extremely clear surpassing the sight of men he sees beings arising in accordance with their own kamma brahmin this cutipapata fana the knowledge of passing away and arising of beings also is said to be the tathagata footprint of knowledge the tathagata’s mark of rubbing with the knowledge and the tathagata thrusting and

rubbing with knowledge and the tathagata thrusting and scratching with the tusk of knowledge but just by this much the ariyan disciple of the bhagava has not yet come to the conclusion regarding the triple gem however he has reached to the extent of believing thus “the bhagava is perfectly self enlightened one the dhamma is well proclaimed by the bhagava the sanigha the order of the disciples of the bhagavad is endowed with right practice” knowing thus and sccing thus his mind is liberated from kamasava the defilement of scnse pleasure is liberated from bhavasava the defilement of hankering after better existences is liberated from avijjasava the defilement of ignorance when the mind was thus liberated there occurred the knowledge “it is liberated” he knows rebirth is ended the noble practice has been accomplished what needed to be done for attainment of magga insight has been done nothing else remains to be done for this attainment of magga brahmin the knowledge paccavekkhana fana is said to be the tathagata footprint mark of knowledge and the tathagata’s mark of rubbing with application of the knowledge and the tathagata marks of thrusting and scratching with the tusk of

bhagava is the perfectly self enlightened one that the dhamma is well proclaimed by the bhagava that the sanigha the order of the disciples of the bhagava is endowed with right practice brahmin by this much the simile of the elephant footprint is complete in detail when this was said brahmin jaqussoni said to the bhagava thus iii opamma vagga “o gotama excellent it is gotama xcellent it is it is gotama as if one turns up what lies upside down as if one uncovers what lies covered as if one shows the way to another who is lost as if one holds up lamp in the darkness for those with eyes to see visible objects even so the revered gotama has taught the dhamma in various ways take refuge in the revered gotama take refuge in the dhamma and take refuge in the sanigha may the revered gotama take me as disciple who has taken refuge in the buddha the dhamma and the sanigha from today onwards till the end of life end of ctiahatthipadopama sutta the seventh in this vagga mahahatthipadopama sutta the great discourse on the elephant footprint simile thus have heard at one time the bhagava was residing at the jetavana monastery of anathapindika in savatthi then the venerable riputta addressed the bhikkhus saying “reverend bhikkhus “the bhikkhus replied to the venerable sdriputta saying “your reverence ’’ and the venerable sdriputta spoke thus your reverences just as any footprint of beings that walk the earth can be contained in an elephant footprint and thus the elephant’s footprint is said to be supreme among all footprints because of its greut size even so all meritorious factors can be reckoned under the four ariya truths and what are these four in which all meritorious factors can be included mahahatthipadopama sutta they are the ariya truths of dukkha the ariya truth of the cause of dukkha the ariya truth of the cessation of dukkha and the ariya truth of the way leading to the cessation of dukkha your reverences what is the ariya truth of dukkha repeated coming into existence is dukkha ageing also is dukkha death also is dukkha grief lamentation pain distress and despair are also dukkha craving for what one cannot get and not getting it is also dukkha in brief the five aggregates which are the objects of clinging are dukkha and what your reverences are the five aggregates which are the objects of clinging they are the corporcal aggregate which is the object of clinging the sensation aggregate which is the object of clinging the perception aggregate which is the object of clinging the volitional actlivilies aggregate which is the object of clinging and the consciousness aggregate which is the object of clinging and what your reverences is the corporeal aggre gate which is the object of clinging it consists of the four great primary clements and of corporeality derived from the four great primary elements and what your reverences are the four great primary elements they are pathavi element the clement of solidity po element the element of fluidity and cohesion tejo element the element of heat and cold and vayo clement the clement of motion dukkha as an ariya truth is left untranslated ‘suffering’ and ‘ill’ are inadequate renderings dukkha is inherent in existence the five aggregates which are the objects of clinging therefore embody dukkha dukkha has connotations of impermanence insubstantial ity unsatistactoriness emptiness imperfection insecurity besides ‘the obvious ones of ‘suffering’ ‘physical pain’ and ‘mental atflic tion ‘these can be directly translated as the carth element the water element the fire clement and the air element respectively but such rendering may be misleading iii opamma vagga and what your reverences is the pathavi element the element of solidity there is pathavi element in

is pathavi element in oneself and what is it it is the hair of the head the hair of the body nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones marrow kidneys heart liver membranes spleen lungs large intestine small

element in oneself and the external pathavi element are both merely the element of pathavi that pathavi element should be seen as it really is with right understanding thus “this is not mine this is not ‘i’ this is not my atta self having thus seen this pathavi element as it really is with right understanding one gets disgusted with the pathavi element and one’s mind becomes free of attachment to the pathavi element your reverences there comes time when the external po element the element of fluidity and cohesion becomes extremely unsettled at such ime the external pathavi element dissolves your reverences thus the im permanent unenduring destructible and changeable nature of even that immense external pathavi element becomes plainly evident then why should there be any clinging to this body which lasts only for short while and is clung to by craving ‘i’ or ‘mine’ or ‘i am’ then for that bhikkhu who reflects thus there will indeed be no clinging to the pathavi element in oneself the true nature of pathavi lies in the fact that it is subject to the law of anicca impermanence dukkha and anatta non self non ego mahahatthipadopama sutta your reverences if others abuse revile blame and harass that bhikkhu he understands thus this unpleasant sensation due to sensory impingement on the ear has arisen in me it has’ its cause it does not arise without cause and what is the cause

permanent volitional aclivilics due to that ear contact are not permanent con sciousness due to that ear contact not permanent the mind of that bhikkhu enters upon the element object be comes calmly clear composed and settled if your reverences others might attack that bhikkhu with undesirable disagreeable and unpleasant blows lit con tact with the hand with clods of earth with sticks and with weapons he understands thus “it is the nature of this body to be subjected to blows with the hand with clods of earth with sticks and with weapons in the parable of the saw the bhagava has admonished thus ‘bhikkhus vile thieves might cut off small or large limbs of the body with double handled saw whoever when subjected to this treatment might harbour thoughts of enmity is in that case not follow

the vayo element and one’s mind becomes free of attachment to the vayo element your reverences there comes time when the external vayo element the element of motion becomes ex tremely unsettled it carries away village market town city province and district but your reverences there also comes time when in the last month of hot season people have to seek to produce wind by means of palm leaf fan or fan for fanning fire even thatch grass in the eaves from which water usually flows down does not stir your reverences thus the impermanent unenduring destrucuible and changeable nature of even that immense mahdhatthipadopama sutta external vayo element becomes plainly evident then why should there be any clinging to this body which lasts only for short while and is clung to by craving as ’or ‘mine’ or am then for that bnikkhu who reflects thus there will indeed be no clinging to the vayo element in oneself your reverences if others abuse revile blame and harass that bhikkhu he understands thus “this unpleasant sensation due to sensory impingement on the ear has arisen in me it has its cause it does not arise without cause and what is the cause contact or sensory impingement is the cause and he perceives that ear contact is not permanent sensation due to that ear contact is not permanent percep tion due to that ear contact is not permanent volitional activities due to that ear contact are not permanent con sciousness due to that ear contact is not permanent the mind of that bhikkhu enters upon the element object becomes calmly clear composed and settled if your reverences others might attack that bhikkhu with undesirable disagreeable and unpleasant blows lit con tact with the hand with clods of earth with sticks and with weapons he understands thus “it is the nature of this body to be subjected to blows with the hand with clods of earth with sticks and with weapons in the parable of the saw the bhagava has admonished thus ‘bhikkhus vile thieves might cut off small or large limbs of the body with double handled saw whoever when subjected to this treatment might harbour thoughts of enmity is in that case not follow ing my teaching will strive with unrelenting effort and resolve unremitting mindfulness shall be established in me my body will become tranquil and calm my mind will become composed and settled on single object now let this body receive blows with the hand with clods of earth with sticks and with weapons this teaching of the buddhas should be followed iii opamma vagga your reverences if however that bhikkhu in spite of thinking upon the virtues of the buddha thus thinking upon the virtues of the dhamma thus and thinking upon the virtues of the sanigha thus fails to establish himself in equanimity based on meritoriousness he will become agitated and alarmed because of this thinking “in spite of my thinking upon the virtues of the buddha thus of my thinking upon the virtues of the dhamma thus of my thinking upon the virtues of the samigha thus fail to establish myself in equanimity based on meritoriousness in deed it is loss for me it is no gain for me it is bad for me it is not good for me ”’ just as daughter in law becomes agitated and alarmed on seeing her father in law ‘even so that bhikkhu who in spite of thinking upon the virtues of the bhuddha thus of thinking upon the virtues of the dhamma thus and of thinking upon the virtues of the sanigha thus fails to establish himself in equanimity based on meritoriousness will become agitated and alarmed because of this thinking “in spite of my thinking upon

bhagava thus “samana do not enter this forest there are three young men of good family dwelling in this forest desiring to do good for themselves do not cause them discomfort venerable anuruddha heard the forester conversation with the bhagava having heard the forester conversation with the bhagava the venarable anuruddha said to the forester my friend forester do not restrain the bhagava natika was situated on one side of dam being founded by group of families related to one another there were two villages of the same name one headed by the son of younger paternal uncle and the other by the son of an elder paternal uncle the buddha put up at the brick monastery near these two villages the sal trees fork into two branches in the form of bullock’ horns ilence the forest is named gosinga the three venerables who were all arahats lived in that forest in perfect harmony and this is emphasized in this sutta the buddha went to gosiiga alone equipped with robe and bowl unbekaown to others without even informing the venerable sariputta as his intention was to commend his three disciples leading harmonious lite having entered the order bhikkhu usually practises morality learns the scriptures and takes up austere practices deemed suitable for him then having chosen the subjects for meditation to his own liking he practises concentration and insight meditation this is doing good for himself re iv mahdyamaka vagga the bhagava who is coming along is our teacher then the venerable anuruddha approached the venerable nandiya and the venerable kimila and having approached them said

those venerable ones also having made obeisance tc the bhagavad sat down in suitable places the bhagava ad dressed the venerable anuruddha® sitting in suitable place thus “how now anuruddha are you in

eyes of affection indeed venerable sir replied anuruddha we are living all together in harmony in gladness without being contentious being of one mind as the blending of milk and water looking at one another with eyes of affection that anuruddha approached nandiya and kimila before welcoming the buddha indicates that he was anxious to show that he and his companions were living in harmony among the three venerable ones anuruddha was the eldest so the buddha addressed him bhikkhus depend entirely on the four requisites of robes alms food shelter and medicine to enable them to practise the

aside my mind and live according to the will and desire of these venerable ones so vencrable sir lay aside my mind and live according to the will and desire of these venerable ones indeed vener able sir our bodies differ but our minds appear to be one the venerable nandiya the venerable kimila also said thus to the bhagava “venerable sir occurred to me indeed it is gain to me indeed it is well

existence just as bhikkhus sturdy steers and bulloks reached the farther bank safely having swum across the current of the river gatiga even so whichever bhikkhus through the utter destruction of the five fetters binding one to rebirth in lower sensuous realms have come into being spontaneously in the brahma realm never to return from there but to pass away in parinibbana there they will also reach the farther bank of nibbana safely having swum across the current of mara craving for continued existence just as bhikkhus half grown bulls and heife reached the farther bank safely having swum across the current of the river ganga even so the bhikkhus through complete destruc tion of the three fetters and by the lessening of attachment hatred and bewilderment having become sakadagamis will return to this human world only for once to make an end of dukkha they will also reach the farther bank of nibbana safely having swum across the current of mara craving for continued existence just as bhikkhus other younger calves and weaker cattle reached the farther bank safely having swum across the current of the river ganga even so whichever bhikkhus through the utter destruction of the three fetters having become sotapannas stream winners are not liable to fall into apaya the four miserable states are assured of their gestinations bound only for the upper three maggas paths they will also reach the farther bank of nibbana safely having swum across the current of mara craving for continued existence culagopalaka sutta just as bhikkhus young and tender calf born that very day following the mooing of its mother swam across and reached the farther bank safely having swum across the current of the river ganga even so whichever bhikkhus who are striving for insight with knowledge as the predominent factor and who are striving for insight with conviction as the predomiment factor will also reach the farther bank of nibbana safely having swum across the current of mara craving for continued existence bhikkhus am skilled in the knowledge of this world skilled in the knowledge of the other world skilled in the sphere of mara skilled in the sphere beyond mara domain skilled in the sphere of death skilled in the sphere beyond death bhikkhus to those who think they should listen to and put their faith in me their faith will lead to benefit and happiness for long time thus spoke the bhagava and having thus spoken the tathagata the teacher of men and devas uttered these stanzas this world and the other world have been clearly revealed by the enlightened one opened is the door to nibbana of secu rity and deathlessness by the self enlightened one who knows clearly all the worlds acces sible to ra as well as the world inaccessible to the king of death maccuméara cut across and is destroyed the stream of evil one his egoistical pride being made hollow like reed bhikkhus remain in bliss profound aspiring for the highest gain of security of arahatta fruition end of the cu gop élaka sutta the fourth in this vagga iv mahayamaka vagga culasaccaka sutta the shorter saccaka discorrse thus have heard at one time the bhagava was residing at pinnacled monastery in the mahavana wood near vesali at that time saccaka niganthaputta was also staying in vesali he was fond of disputation claiming himself to be sage regarded by many people as good man in an assembly of the people of vesali he said these words “i do not see any samana or brahmana who has group of disciples with his own sect being the teacher of his sect or anyone who professes to be homage worthy by having destroyed kilesas defilements and to be perfectly self enlightened buddha who would not shake tremble and stagger or sweat from the armpits when refute him by means of my arguments if were to enyage in disputation with lifeless” post even that post would shake tremble and stagger because of my arguments let alone human being then in the morning the venerable assaji having rearranged his robes and taking alms bowl and great robe entered vesali for the alms round walking and rambling about in vesali saccaka niganthaputta saw the venerable assaji coming at distance and approached him and ex changed greetings with the venerable assaji and having done so he stood in suitable place then saccaka niganthaputta said to the venerable assaji “o assaji how does samana gotama instruct the disciples what part of the there were man and woman beloging to the nigantha sect they became man and wife and had four daughters namely sacca lola pajacara and acaravati and one son named saccaka men tioned tn this sutta lifeless acetana lit mindless assaji was one of the first five disciples of the buddha culasaccaka sutta many teachings is most emphasized for the disciples of samana gotama “appivessana’ the bhagava instructs the disciples thus this part of the many teachings is most emphasized for the disciples of the bhagava ‘bhikkhus corporeality is imper manent sensation is impermanent perception is impermanent volitional activities are impermanent consciousness is imper manent corporeality bhikkhus is not atta self sensation is not atta perception is not atta volitional activities are not atta consciousness is not atta all conditioned and compounded things are impermanent and all conditioned and uncondi ltioncd things dhamma are not atta thus aggivessana does the bhagava instruct the disciples this part of the many teachings is most emphasized for the disciples of the bhagava “© assaji what improper things indeed do hear we have heard that samana gotama makes assertions like this perhaps we could meet with the honourable gotama some time when there might be some discussion perhaps we could then rid him of this evil view at that time five hundred licchavi princes were assembled at the conference hall to transact some busi ness then saccaka niganthaputta approached the licchavis and said “come forth honourable licchavis come forth honourable licchavis today there will be discussion be tween me and samana gotama if samana gotama stands by his words firmly in the same way as bhikkhu assaji one of his well known disciples stood by his words firmly then just as powerful man taking hold of longfleeced ram by its fleece might pull push and shake it about even so appivessana clan name of saccaka conditioned things are physical and mental phenomena and the one unconditioned thing is nibbana iv mahayamaka vagga will pull push and shake samana gotama about with my arguments and refutations just as powerful workman of liquor shop taking big mat from the liquor shop might throw it into deep lake and seizing it by the corner might pull it push it and shake it about even so will pull push and shake samana gotama about with my arguments and refutations just as powerful drunkard taking hold of liquor strainer by its edge might shake it up shake it down and toss it about even so will shake up shake down and toss about samana gotama with my arguments and refuta tions just as an elephant which gets infirm only when it is sixty might get down into deep pond and play the game of washing hemp® even so will play with samana gotama as in the game of washing hemp with my arguments and refutations come forth honourable licchavis come forth honourable liccchavis today there will be dicussion be tween me and samana gotama from among them some licchavis spoke thus “how can samana gotama refute the assertions of saccaka niganthaputta it is saccaka niganthaputta only who will be able to refute the assertions of samana gotama but some licchivis said ‘“what kind of man is saccaka niganjhaputta that he would be able to refute the bhagava indeed it is the bhagava only who will be able to refute saccaka niganthaputta then saccaka niganthaputta surrounded by five hun dred licchavis went to the pinnacled monastery in the mahavana wood in this game the players let handfuls of hemp get soaked in water for three days at the end of third day the hemp is taken out and beaten on plank night left and front by the players while enjoying food and dnnok the elephant imitating this action playfully showers himself with water pumped by his trunk onto his head his back both sides and between the thighs culasaccaka sutta at that time number of bhikkhus were walking up and down in the open air saccaka niganthaputta apporached tiem and said “sirs where is that honouravle gotama stay ing now we would like to see that honourable gotama “aggivessana the bhagava having gone into the mahavana wood is sitting at the foot of tree to spend the day ”” then saccka niganthaputta with great company of the licchavis entered the mahavana wood and approached the bhagava having thus approached he exchanged greet ings with the bhagava having brought to an end the courte ous and amiable greetings he sat in suitable place some of the licchavis did obeisance to the bhagava and sat in suitable place some exchanged greetings with the bhagava and having concluded the courteous and amiable grectings sat in suitable place some bowed with clasped plams towards the bhagava and sat in suitable place some made their names and lineage known to the bhagava and sat in suitable place some remaining silent sat in suitable place saccaka niganjhaputta having sat down at suitable place spoke thus to the bhagava “if the honourable gotama permits me to ask question would like to ask the honourable gotama on certain point “ask aggivessana whatever you like “how does the honourable gotama instruct the dis ciples what part of the many teachings is most emphasized for the disciples of the honourable gotama “aggivessana thus do instruct the disciples and this’ part of the many teachings is most emphasized for my disciples ‘bhikkhus corporeality

percep to spend the day to pass tha day in solitary meditation iv mahayamaka vagga tion is not atta volitional activities are not atta consciousness is not atta atta conditioned and compounded things are impermanent and all conditioned and unconditioned things dhamma are not atta thus aggivessana do instruct the disciples this part of the many teachings is most emphasized for my disciples “a simile gotama occurs to me “reveal it aggivessana said the bhagava “o gotama it is like this just as all seed germs and vegetative germs come to growth development and maturity dependent on earth and based on earth and just as gotama all kinds of work done with physical strength® are dependent on earth and based on earth even so gotama an individual has corporeality atta and produces either merit or demerit based on corporeality this individual has sensa tion atta and ‘produces merit or demerit based on sensation this individual has perception atta and produces merit or demerit based on perception this individual has volitional activities atta and produces merit or demerit based on volitinal activities this individual has consciousness atta and produces merit or demerit based on consciounsness “do you say aggivessana ‘corporeality is my atta self sensation is my atta perception is my atta volitional activities are my atta and consciousness is my atta’ “o gotama indeed do say ‘corporeality is my atta sensation is my atta perception is my atta volitional activities are my atta and consciousness is my atta and the great mass of people say this as well agricultural or commerical pursuits involving the use of physical strength this is saccaka view it mean all merit and demerit spring from the self atta constituted by the five aggregates of corporeality sensation perception volitional activities and consciousness culasaccaka sutta “what has your great mass of people to do with this aggivessana urge you to explain your own view aggivessana” “o gotama indeed do say ‘corporeality is my atta sensation is my atta volitional activities are my atta and consciousness is my atta’ “aggivessana in that case will ask you in turn about this answer me as you please what aggivessana do you think of this would an anointed king such as king pasenadi of kosala or king ajatasattu of the kingdom of magadha the son of queen vedehi have the power in their respective realms to put to death one deserving to be put to death to confiscate the property of one whose property ought to be confiscated and to banish one deserving of banish ment “o gotama an anointed king such as

‘deserving of banishment what more then can be said of an anointed king such as king pasenadi of kosala or king ajatassatty of the kingdom of magadha the son of queen vedehi he would have the power

mahadyamaka vagga corporeal form bé thus let my corporeal form be not thus’ when thus asked saccaka niganthaputta remained silent for the second time the bhagava asked saccaka niganthaputta thus aggivessana what do you think of this you say thus ‘corporeality is my attta do you have power over that corporeality and can you say ‘let my ccrporeal form be thus let my corporeal form be not thus for the second time saccaka niganthaputta remained silent then the bhagava said to saccaka niganthaputta thus “aggivessana answer the question now now is not the time for you to remain silent if anyone aggivessana does not answer question put by the tathagata reasonably up to the third time his head will split into seven pieces here and now then the thunderbolt wielding sakka king of the devas holding burning blazing and flaming iron thunderbolt came to stand in the air above saccaka niganthaputta intending “if this saccaka niganthaputta fails to answer the question put by the bhagava reasonably up to the third time shall split his head into seven pieces here and now the bhagava as well as saccaka niganthaputta saw the thunderbolt wield ing sakka then saccaka niganshaputta being afraid agi tated with hair standing on end and seeking protection shelter and refuge only in the bhagava spoke to the bhagava thus “be pleased to ask me honourable gotama will answer with regard to corporeal form one may make this wish “let me appear bright beautiful glittering like golden pillar and colourful like well woven cloth or he might pray “may my appearance rot be ugly wrinkled and

this was said saccaka niganthaputta sat speech less dejected with drooping shoulders and fallen lit low ered face downcast and at his wit end then dummukha licchavi finding that saccaka niganthaputta was speechless dejected with drooping shoul ders and fallen face downcast and at his wit’s end spoke to the bhagava thus “a simile occurs to me bhagava the bhagava said “dummukha reveal it ‘“supppose venerable sir there were crab in pond near village or town many boys and girls coming out from that village or town might apprvach the pond and might go down into the pond taking the crab out of the water they might put it on dry ground and venerable sir as often as that crab would thrust out claw those boys and girls would cut it break it and smash it with sticks and potsherds just as that crab with its claws cut broken and smashed would be unable to get down into the pond again as before even so venerable sir saccaka nigan haputta will be unable now to come round to the bhagava to make refulations and assertions as the bhagava has cut broken and smashed all the distorted conceited twisted views of saccaka niganthaputta the buddha loosened his outer robe aying bare that part of the

assail the honourable gotama by refutations and arguments indeed gotama there might be safety for man who attacks an elephant in must but there could be no safety for man attacking the honourable

gotama by refutations and arguments may the honourable gotama be pleased to accept my offering of an alms meal together with the community of bhikkhus tomorrow the bhagava gave his consent by remaining silent then knowing that the bhagava had consented saccaka niganthaputta spoke to the licchavis thus “let the honourable licchavis listen to me have invited samana gotama together with the community of bhikkhus for an ‘alms meal tomorrow therefore bring me whatever you think is suitable for him then when the night passed those licchavis’ brought to saccaka niganthaputta five hundred pots of cooked food as offerings then saccaka niganthaputta having made ready sumptuous alms food hard and soft at his place informed the bhagava that it was time by the message ““ gotama it is time the alms food is ready iv mahayamaka vagga then in the morning the bhagava having rearranged his robes and taking alms bowl and great robe went to the place of saccaka niganthaputta and took the seat prepared for him together with the community of bhikkhus saccaka niganthaputta served with his own hands sumptuous food both hard and soft to the bhikkhus headed by the buddha till they were completely satisfied and could not take more when the bhagava having had his alms meal had with drawn his hand from the alms bowl saccaka niganthaputta took low seat and sat down in suitable place having thus sat down saccaka nigan haputta said to the bhagava thus ‘“‘ gotama may any meritorious result and the ample consequences this offering produces be for the well being of the donors the licchavis ‘““aggivessana whatever merit gained from giving to receiver of offerings who like you is not free from attach ‘ment malice and bewilderment will be for the donors the licchavis who gave to you and whatever merit gained from giving to receiver of offerings who like me is free from attachment malice and bewilderment will be for you end of the cijasaccaka sutta the fifth in this vagga the meritorious result means existence in the form of the five aggregates in the deva realms or in desirable condition in the human world the ample consequences or subsidiary results will be in the form of appurtenances to that existence such as for instance regalia or sumptuous living conditions mahasaccaka sutta the major saccaka discourse thus have heard at one time the bhagavad was residing at pinnacled monastery in the mahavana wood near vesali then in the morning the bhagava desiring to enter vesali for alms food robed himself well taking alms bowl and great robe at the same time saccaka niganthaputta walking and roaming about for exercise approached the pinnacled monastery in the mahavana wood seeing saccaka niganthaputta coming in the distance the venerable ananda said’ to the bhagava “there comes this saccaka nigantputta who is fond of disputation who claims to be sage and who is regarded by many people as good man that man venerable sir desire to disparage the buddha to disparage the dhamma and to disparage the sanigha venerable sir entreat the bhagava to sit down for while out of compassion accord ingly the bhagava took the seat prepared for him then saccaka niganthaputta approached the bhagava and having thus approached he exchanged greeting with the bhagava having concluded the courteous and amiable greeting he sat in suitable place and addressed the bhagava thus there are gotama some samanas and brahmanas who pursue lit abide in the practice of training with regard to the body through austerities and not the practice of training of the mind indeed they experience gotama ‘bodily pain it has happened in the past gotama that whoever experienced pain in the body suffered rigidness of the thigh or his heart burst or hot blood gushed from his mouth or he went mad or became distraught in mind his mind gotama was subservient to the body being under the power of the body why is that so it is because of lack of training of the mind sos iv mahayamaka vagga but gotama there are some samanas and brahmanas who pursue the practice of training of the mind and not the practice of training with regard to the body through austeri ties indeed they experience gotama mental pain it has happened in the past gotama that whoever experienced pain in the mind suffered rigidness of the thigh or his heart burst or hot blood gushed from his mouth or he went mad or became distraught in mind his body gotama was subservient to the mind being under the power of the mind why is that so it is because of lack of training with regard to the body through austerities to me gotama it occurs thus ‘indeed the honourable gotama disciples pursue the practice of training the mind and not the practice of training with regard to the body through austerities aggivessana what have you heard about train ing with regard to the body as examples of this training with regard to the body there are nanda vaccha kisa safikicca and makkhali gosala gotama they go naked adopt loose habits of urinating or defecating or eating in standing position wipe off the excreta with the hand refuse to accept alms food offered with reverential request of “come sir or “stop sir refuse alms food brought to them refuse alms food intended for them refuse alms food on invitation they refuse alms according to the teaching of the buddha training with regard to the body means insight meditation vipssana and training the mind means the samatha practice of concentration to non buddhists like saccaka of the sect of niganthas training with regard to the body meant the practice of extreme self mortification they held the view that one who failed to practise both body and mind training by the method of self mortification would suffer all kinds of troubles saccaka was not in possession of the correct knowledge of vipassana and samatha for yogis practising them according to the way shown by the buddha there can be no such physical pain as rigidness in the legs or thighs or mental pain such as distraction mahasaccaka sutta food ladled out from cooking pot refuse alms food ladled out from vessel refuse alms food offered across thresh old refuse alms food offered across stick refuse alms food offered across pestle refuse alms food offered while two people were eating refuse alms food offered by preg nant woman refuse alms food offered by woman giving suck refuse alms food offered by woman staying close to man refuse alms food collected and distributed by public announcement refuse alms food where ‘dog awaits feeding and refuse alms food where flies are swarming they do not accept fish or meat do not drink fermented liquor or spirits or fermented brew they accept alms food only at one house and eat only one mounthful or accept alms food only at two houses and eat only two mouthfuls or accept alms food only at seven houses and eat only seven mouthfuls they sustain themselves with only one small cupful of alms food or with only two small cupfuls or with only seven small cupfuls they eat only once day or once in two days pp of once in seven days thus do they abide in this practice of taking food at long intervals up to even only once in half month but aggivessana can they sustain themselves with so little no gotama sometimes gotama they eat very delicious hard food they eat very delicious soft food they taste very savoury things and drink very delicious drinks it means that they make this body gain strenght develop and get fattened aggivessana those people give up things in the first instance and later collect them for growth of the body thus there come to be accumulation and diminution of this body but what have you aggivessana heard about training of the mind when the bhagava asked saccaka niganthaputta about the training of the mind he could not answer satisfactorily so iv mahayamaka vagga then the bhagava said to saccaka niganthaputta thus “aggivessana first you spoke about training with re gard to the body but that is not the proper training with regard to the body according to the teaching in the ariya discipline aggivessana you do not know even the training with regard to the body how can you know the training of the mind nevertheless aggivessana listen how one is un trained with regard to the body untrained in mind and how one is trained with regard to the body trained in mind pay good attention and shall speak as saccaka niganthaputta replied “very well sir the bhagava spoke thus how aggivessana is one untrained with re gard to the body and untrained in mind in this matter aggivessana pleasant sensation arises in an unlearned worldling coming into contact with pleasant sensation he becomes very much attached to the pleasant sensation and keeps on being attached to the pleasant sensation when the pleasant sensation ceases in him there arises an unpleasant sensation due to the cessation of the pleasant sensation when he comes into contact with unpleasant sensation he mourns grieves laments beats his breast weeps and falls into bewil derment aggivessana that pleasant sensation which arises in him overpowers his mind because of the lack of training with regard to the body through insight meditation and that unpleasant sensation also which arises in him overpowers his mind because of the lack of training of the mind through concentration thus aggivessana both phenomena occur in any individual the pleasant sensation thal arises in him overpowers his mind because of the lack of training with regard to the body through insight meditaion and the un pleasant sensation also thal arises in him overpowers his mind because of the lack of training of the mind through concen tration in this way aggivessana one is untrained with regard to the body and untrained in mind mahdsaccaka sutta and how aggivessana is one trained with regard to the body and trained in mind in this matter aggivessana pleasant sensation arises in learned ariya disciple of the buddha but coming into contact with pleas ant sensation he does not become attached to the pleasant sensation and does not keep on being attached to the pleasant sensation when the pleasant sensation ceases in him there arises an unpleasant sensation due to the cessation of the pleasant sensation but when he comes into contact with unpleasant sensation he does not mourn grieve lament beat his breast weep and fall into bewilderment aggivessana that pleasant sensation which arises in him cannot overpower his mind because of the training with regard to the body through insight meditation and that unpleasant sensation also which arises in him cannot overpower his mind because of the training of the mind through concentration thus aggivessana both phenomena occur in any individual the pleasant sensation that arises in him cannot overpower his mind because of the training with regard to the body through insight meditation and the unpleasant sensa tion also that arises in him cannot overpower his mind becasuse of the training of the mind through concentration in this way aggivessana one is trained with regard to the body and trained in mind have this confidence in the honourable gotama that the honourable gotama is both trained with regard to the body and trained in mind aggivessana indeed your remarks are taunting and sarcastic but will answer you aggivessana with me there has ‘been no possibility for any pleasant sensation arising in me to overpower my mind since cut off my hair and beard wore the bark dyed robe renounced hearth and home and embraced the homeless life neither has there been any possibility for an unpleasant sensation arising in me to overpower my mind iv mahayamaka vagga then it appears that there has never arisen in the honourable gotama such thing as pleasant sensation that might overpower the mind and that there has never arisen in the honourable gotama such thing as unpleasant sensation that might overpower the mind why not aggivessana in this matter while was still bodhisatta not having yet penetrating knowledge into the four truths before enlightenment realization of magga insight this thought occurred to me ‘confined is the life of householder it is path laden with dust of kilesas defilements samana’s life is like an open plain not easy it is for layman to pursue the noble practice in all its fullness in all its purity like polished conch better it is that cut off my hair and beard don the bark dyed robe re nounce hearth and home and become recluse leading the homeless life aggivessana afterwards while still young with luxu riant black hair in the first period of life in the prime of youth cut off my hair and beard donned the bark dyed robe while my mother and father not desiring this cried with tearful faces renounced hearth and home for the homeless life having become samana seeking what is wholesome and searching for the sublime peace of nibbana which is incomparable approached ara kalama and having thus approached said to him “friend kalama desire to take up the noble practice in this teaching and discipline of yours aggivessana when this was said ara kalama said to me thus “your reverence stay here this dhamma is such that in short lime an intelligent person should enter upon attain and abide in it himself realizing the doc trine of his teacher through special apperception soon aggivessana learnt that dhamma very quickly then what is wholesome doctrine and practice that is faultless this dhamma this doctrine and practice mahdsaccaka sutta sil aggivessana was able to say that knew and was profi cient by just repeating the words uttered by mere move ment of the master lips myself professed possession of knowledge and vision others confirmed this then aggivessana it occured to me “it is not merely out of his own belief that ara kalama declares have entered upon and abide in this dhamma‘ realizing it myself through special apperception’ for certainly ara kalama abides in the knowledge and vision of this dhamma then aggivessana approached ara kalama and asked him “friend kalama to what extent do you declare to have entered upon and to be abiding in the dhamma realizing it yourself through special apperception aggivessana when this was said ara kalama declared having attained the akificanfnayatana jhana aggivessana this occurred to me ‘not only alara kalama has faith also have faith not only alara kalama has energy also have energy not only ara has mindfulness also have mindfulness not only ara kalama has concentration also have concen tration not only alara kalama has understanding also have understanding it would be good if were to make the endeavour to realize the dhamma which ara kalama has declared as having entered upon and as abiding in realizing it himself through special apperception soon aggivessana quickly entered upon and abide in that dhamma realizing it myself through special apperception aggivessana then approached alara kalama and asked him friend kalama is it to this extent that you declare having attained this dhamma realizing it yourself through special apperception “friend it is to this extent that declare to have attained this dhammas realizing it myself through special ap perception the stage of achievement the jhana attained what is the attainment you have reached through your doctrine and practice iv mahayamaka vagga “friend too abide in this dhamma having attained it to the same extent realizing it myself through special apperception ‘“freind it is good gain to us friend it is well gotten for us to have found in your reverence such companion in the noble practice the dhamma that declare to have attained realizing it myself through special apperception is the one you abide in having attained it realizing it yourself through special apperception the dhamma that you abide in having attained it realizing it yourself through special apper ception is the one declare to have attained realizing it myself through special apperception thus you know the dhamma that know and know the dhamma that you know thus you are as am and so am as you are come friend now the two of us who are men of virtue will lead this group aggivessana thus did ara kalama make me his coequal although he was my teacher and his pupil he honoured me with the highest honour then aggivessana it occurred to me this dhamma® does not leads to disillu sionment with the five khandhas nor to abandonment of attachment nor to cessation of the round of dukkha nor to the extinction of kilesas defilements nor to magga insight abhinna nor to realization of the four ariya truth nor to realization of nibbana it leads only to the attainment of the realm of nothingness without proceeding with that dhamma turned away from it in disenchantment then aggivessana seeking what is whole some and searching for the sublime peace of nibbana which is incomparable approached udaka ramaputta and having thus approached said to him friend desire to take up the noble practice in this teaching and discipline of yours the doctrine and practice of alara kalama led only to the attainment of seven jhanas from the first jhdna to the sustained absorption in the jhana of the concept nothing is there mahasaccaka sutta aggivessana when this was said udaka ramaputta said to me thus “your reverence fay here this dhamma is such that in short time an intelligent person should enter upon attain and abide in it himself realizing the doctrine of his teacher through special apperception ”” soon aggivessana learnt that dhamma very quickly then aggivessana was able to say that knew and was proficient by just repeating the words uttered by mere movement of the master lips myself professed possession of knowledge and vision others confirmed this then aggivessana it occurred to me “it was not merely out of his own belief that rama’ declared have entered upon and abide in this dhamma realizing it myself through special apperception for certainly rama abided in the knowledge and vision of this dhamma then aggivessana approached udaka ramaputta and asked him “friend to what extent did rama declare to have entered upon and to have abided in the dhamma realizing it himself through special apperception aggivessana when this was said udaka ramaputta declared that it was the attainment of the nevasannanasannayatana jhana aggivessana this occurred to me not only rama had faith also have faith not only rama had energy also have energy not only rama had mindfulness also have mind fulness not only rama had concentration also have concentration not only rama had understanding also have understanding it would be good if were to make the endeavour to realize the dhamma which rama had declared as having entered upon and abided in realizing it himself through special apperception soon aggivessana quickly entered upon and abided in that dhamma realizing it myself through special apperception where ‘rama’ is used in this paragraph it refers to the late leader of that sect and not to udaka ramaputta iv mahayamaka vagga aggivessana then approached udaka ramaputta and asked him ‘friend is it to this extent that rama declared having attained this dhamma realizing it himselt through special apperception “friend it is to this extent that rama declared to have attained this dhamma realizing it himself through special apperception “friend too abide in this dhamma having attained it to the same extent realizing it myself through special apperception “friend it is good gain to us friend it is well gotten for us to have found in your reverence such companion in the noble practice the dhamma that rama declared to have attained realizing it himself through special appercep tion is the one you abide in having attained it realizing it yourself through special apperception the dhamma that you abide in having attained it realizing it yourself through special apperception is the one ma declared to have attained realizing it himself through special apperception thus you know the dhamma that rama knew well and rama knew well the dhamma that you know thus you are as rama was and so was rama as you are come friend do you now lead this group aggivessana thus did udaka ramaputta my com panion in the noble practice set me in the position of teacher and honoured me with the highest honour then aggivessana it occurred to me ‘this dhamma® does not lead to disillusionment with the five khandhas nor to abandon ment of attachment nor to cessation of the round of dukkha nor to extinction of kilesas defilements nor to magga insight abhifina nor to realization of the four ariya truths the teaching and practice of rama led only to the attainment of the eight jhanas from the first jhdna to the sustained absorption in the jhana of neither perception nor non perception neither consciousness nor non consciousness mahasaccaka sutta nor to realization of bb ana it leads only to the attainment of the realm of neither perception nor non perception without proceeding with that dhamma turned away from it in disenchantment aggivessana seeking what is wholesome and searching for the sublime peace of nibbana which is incom parable wandered through the country of magadha from one place to another and arrived at the small town of sena near the uruvela wood there saw delightful stretch of land pleasant grove flowing river with clear delightful gently sloping banks and village in the vicinity suitable for seeking alms food aggivessana thought ‘indeed say here is delightful stretch of land pleasant grove flowing river with clear delightful gently sloping banks and village in the vicinity suitable for seeking alms food this place is appropriate for worthy man desiring to engage in meditation endeavour to take up the practice of meditation endeavour then aggivessana resided in that very place thinking this place is fit for taking up the practice of meditation endeavour then aggivessana three wonderful similes never indeed heard before came to my mind suppose aggivessana that there were ‘a wet and sappy piece of firewood lying in water then there might come man bringing fire making stick for kindling fire by friction thinking ‘i will make fire will produce heat aggivessana what do you think about this could that man make fire and produce heat by rubbing the fire making stick against this wet sappy piece of firewood lying in water no gotama why it is because the firewood is wet sappy and lying in water only fatigue and vexation would be the lot of that man aggivessana in like manner there are some samanas and brahmanas who live without keeping themselves aloof from sense pleasures bodily and mentally they have not got iv mahayamaka vagga rid of nor stilled the desire for sense plesures the slime of sense desire the stupor of sense desire the thirst of sense desire and the fever of sense desire that lie within them even if those respected samanas and brahmanas experience painful severe acute and sharp sensations due to striving such as practising self mortification they woud not be able to gain knowledge vision and the incomparable enlightenment and even if those respected samana and brahmanas do not expe rience painful severe acute and sharp sensations due to striving such as practising self mortification they would not be able to gain knowledge vision and the incomparable enlightenment aggivessana this first and foremost simile wonderful and never heard before came to my mind then aggivessana second wonderful simile never heard before presented itself to my mind suppose that there were wet and sappy piece of firewood lying on dry ground far from water then there might come man bring ing fire making stick for kindling fire by friction thinking ‘i will make fire will produce heat aggivessana what do you think about this could that man make fire and produce heat by rubbing the fire making stick against this wet sappy piece of firewood lying on dry ground far from water no gotama why it is because the firewood although lying on dry ground far from water is wet and sappy only fatigue and vexation would be the lot of that man aggivessana in like manner there are some samanas and brahmanas who live keeping themselves aloof from sense pleasures bodily and mentally but they have not quite got rid of nor quite stilled the desire for sense pleasures the slime of sense desire the stupor of sense desire the thirst of sense desire and the fever of sense desire that lie within them even if those respected samanas and brahmanas expe ic will not attain magga insight mahdsaccaka sutta ji rience painful severe acute and sharp sensations due to striving such as self mortification they would not be able to gain knowledge vision and incomparable enlightenment and even if those respected samanas and brahmanas do not experience painful severe acute and sharp sensations due to striving such as self mortification they would not be able to gain knowledge vision and the incomparable enlightenment aggivessana this second simile wonderful and never heard before presented itself to my mind then aggivessana third wonderful simile never heard before presented itself to my mind suppose that there were dry sapless piece of fire wood lying on dry ground far from water then there might come man bring ing fire making stick thinking ‘i will make fire will produce heat aggivessana what do you think about this could that man make fire and produce heat by rubbing the fire making stick against this dry sapless piece of firewood lying on dry ground far from water yes gotama why it is because the firewood is dry and sapless besides lying on dry ground far from water aggivessana in like manner there are some samanas and brahmanas who live keeping themselves aloof from sense pleasures bodily and mentally they have completely got rid of and have completely stilled the desire for sense pleasures the slime of sense desire the stupor of sense desire the thirst of sense desire and the fever of sense desire within them if those respected samanas and brahmanas experience painful severe acute and sharp sensations due to striving such as practising austerity they would be able to gain wet and sappy firewood lying in water in the first simile denotes samanas and brahmangas who cannot get away from homelife and who are beset with kilesas wet and sappy firewood lying on dry ground in the second simile denotes samagas and brahmanas leading homeless life but still not free from kilesas iv mahayamaka vagga knowledge vision and the incomparable enlightenment and even if those respected samanas and brahmanas dé not experience painful severe acute and sharp sensations due to striving such as practising austerity they would be able to gain konwledge vision and the incomparable enlightenment aggivessana this third wonderful simile never heard before presented itself to my mind aggivessana these three won derful similes never heard before presented themselves to my mind aggivessana it occurred to me ‘it would be good if were to subdue squeeze and torment my mind with my mind while clenching the teeth and pressing the tongue against the palate then subdued squeezed and tormented my mind with my mind while clenching the teeth and pressing the tongue against the palate aggivessana as subdued squeezed and tormented my mind with my mind while clenching the teeth and pressing the tongue against the palate sweat poured from my armpits just as aggivessana strong man having taken hold of weak man by his head or shoulders would subdue squeezed and torment the latter so too when subdued squeezed and tormented my mind with my mind while clenching the teeth and pressing the tongue against the palate sweat poured from my armpits aggivessana put forth utmost energy without flagging established unremitting mindfulness over whelmed exhausted by the endeavour my body was extremely disturbed not calm due to that painful endeavour however aggivessana such kind of painful sensation that arose could not overpower my mind subduing the mind means pressing out unwholesome thoughts of sense pleasures by means of wholesome thoughts associated with right thinking thus giving no chance for unwholesome thoughts to arse to squeeze the mind means to force out unwholesome thoughts to torment the mind means to crush or scorch unwolesome thoughts by means of energy applied in dispelling them mahasaccaka sutta aggivessana it again occurred to me it would be good if were to enter upon the jhana of non breathing aggivessana then stopped breathing in and breathing out through the mouth and through the nose aggivessana as stopped breathing in and breathing out through the mouth and through the nose the noise of winds esacping from the ear holes became exceedingly loud just as aggivessana the noise caused by smith’s bellows blowing air is exceedingly loud so too was the noise caused by winds escaping from the ear holes as stopped breathing in and breathing out through the mouth and through the nose aggivessana put forth utmost energy without flagging established unremitting mindfulness overwhelmed by the endeavour my body was extremely disturbed not calm due to that painful endeavour however aggivessana such kind of painful sensation also that arose could not overpower my mind aggivessana it again occurred to me ‘it would be good if were to further enter upon the jhana of non breathing aggivessana stopped breathing in and breath ing out through the mouth through the nose and through the ears aggivessana as stopped breathing in and breathing out through the mouth through the nose and through the ears violent winds assailed the inside of my head just as aggivessana strong man splits the head with sharp spike so too violent winds assailed the inside of my head as stopped breathing in and breathing out through the mouth through the nose and through the ears aggivessana put forth utmost energy without flagging established unremitting mindfulness overwhelmed by the endeavour my body was extremely disturbed not calm due to that painful endeavour however aggivessana such kind of painful sensation also that arose could not overpower my mind aggivessana it again occurred to me ‘it would be good if were to further enter upon the jhana of non breathing aggivessana stopped breathing in and breathing iv mahayamaka vagga out through the mouth through the nose and through the ears aggivessan as stopped breathing in and breathing out through the mouth through the nose and through the ears suffered extremely violent headaches just as aggivessana strong man had tightened stout leather thong round the head so tow suffered extremely violent headaches as stopped breathing in and breathing out through the mouth through the nose and through the ears aggivessana put forth utmost energy without flagging established unremitting mindfulness overwhelmed by the endeavour my body was extremely disturbed not calm due to that painful endeavour however aggivessana such kind of painful sensation also that arose could not overpower my mind aggivessana it again occurred to me ‘it would be good if were to further enter upon the jhana of non breathing aggivessana stopped breathing in and breathing out through the mouth through the nose and throu the ears aggivessana as stopped breathing in and breathing out through the mouth through the nose and through the ears violent winds pierced my stomach through and through aggivessana just as skilled butcher or his apprentice might pierce the stomach through and through with sharp knife so too violent winds pierced my stomach through and through as stopped breathing in and breathing out through the mouth through the nos and through the ears aggivessana put forth utmost energy without flagging established unremitting mindfulness overwhelmed by the endeavour my body was extremely disturbed not calm due to that painful endeavour however aggivessana such kind of painful sensation also that arose could not overpower my mind aggivessana it again occurred to me ‘it would be good if were to further enter upon the jhana of non breathing aggivessana stopped breathing in and breathing out through the mouth through the nose and through the ears aggivessana as stopped breathing in and breathing mahadsaccaka sutta out through the mouth through the nose and through the ears there was excessive burning in my body aggivessana just as two strong men taking hole of weak man by the arms might grill and roast him over pit of live coals so too there was excessive buring in my body as stopped breathing in and breathing out through the mouth through the nose and through the ears aggivessana pv‘ forth utmost energy without flagging established unremitting mindfulness over whelmed by the endeavour my body was extremely disturbed not calm due to that painful endeavour however aggivessana such kind of painful sensation also hat arose could not overpower my mind aggivessana having seen me the devas verily spoke thus “samana gotama has passed away some however said “samana gotama has not yet passed away but he is about to pass away some also said “samana gotama has not passed away nor is he about to pass away samana gotama is an arahant the way an arahat lives is just like this aggivessana it again occurred to me ‘it would be good if were to take up the practice of total abstinence trom food then aggivessana the devas ap proached me and said “friend do not practise total absti nence from food if you practise total abstinence from food we will be constrained to inject divine essence thicugh the pores of the skin you will be sustained by that essence then aggivessana thought “if insist lit continue to affirm ‘i will totally abstain from food these devas would inject divine essence through the pores of the skin then will be sustained by that essence that affirmation would mean deception” so aggivessana forbade those devas saying ‘it will not be proper the bodhisatta told the devas not to inject deva essence into his body declaring that he would take food that would keep him going iv mahayamaka vagga aggivessana it again occurred to me ‘it would be good if were to take only little handful of such food as kidney bean soup horse gram soup chicken pea soup or pea soup aggivessana then took only little handful of such food as kindney bean soup horse gram soup chicken pea soup or pea soup aggivessana as took only little handful of such food as kidney bean soup horse gram soup chicken pea soup or pea soup my body became ex tremely emaciated so little did eat that the large or smal limbs of my body became like the joints of vine or of climbing creeper so little did eat that my posteriors became like camel hoof so little did eat that my spine had knobs like strung beads so little did eat that my gaunt ribs were sunk in disarray like the tumble down rafters of an old rest house falling to pieces so little did eat that the pupils of my eyes appeared sunk deep in the sockets looking like the gleam of water lying at the bottom of deep well so little did eat that my scalp became shrivelled and shrunk like bitter white gourd freshly plucked when green that shrivels and shrinks due to the heat of the sun and the wind aggivessana when touched the skin of my stom ach it was my backbone that felt and when touched the backbone it was the skin of my stomach that felt aggivessana so little did eat that the skin of my stomach appeared to be sticking fast to my backbone aggivessana when rose to defecate or to urinate fell on my face then and there because ate so little aggivessana rubbed my limbs with my hands to sooth this body aggivessana as thus rubbed my limbs with my hands the hairs rotted at the roots fell away from my body because ate so little indeed aggivessana men seeing me said “samana gotama is black others said “samana gotama is not black but brownish yellow still others said “samana gotama is neither black nor brownish yellow but is of the colour of mangura fish aggivessana my complexion which had mahdsaccaka sutta been so clear and shining became spoilt to that extent because ate so little then aggivessana this occurred to me ‘all samanas and brahmanas of the past who experienced painful severe acute and sharp sensations due to striving had expe rienced these sensations only to this extent and not to greater extent and all samanas and brahmanas of the future who will experience painful severe acute and sharp sensa tions due to striving will experience these sensations only to this extent and not to greater extent and all samanas and brahmanas of the present who experience painful severe acute and sharp sensations due to striving experience these sensations only to this extent and not to greater extent but have not realized the distinctive knowledge and vision superior to the human norm of meritorious acts that will enable me to become an ariya by means of this severe and austere endeavour lit practice of hard task could there be another way to enlightenment then it occurred to me remember that while my father the king of the sakyans was holding the ceremony of ploughing and as was sitting in the cool shade of rose apple tree became detached from sensual pleasures and demeritorious factors and achieved and remained in the first jhana which has vitakka initial applica tion of the mind vicdra sustained application of the mind which has piti delightful satisfaction and sukha bliss born of detachment from the hindrances nivaranas might that first jhana be the way leading to enlightenment then aggivessana following on that memory came the realization ‘this is indeed the way leading to enlightenment and thought ‘why should be afraid of that bliss of the first jhana which is detached from the pleasure of the senses and detached from demeritorious faciors aggivessana again thought ‘i am not afraid of that bliss of the first jhana distinctive knowledge and vision magga insight and fruition iv mahayamaka vagga which is detached from the pleasures of the senses and detached from demeritorious factors then aggivessana it occurred to me ‘it is not easy to achieve that bliss of the first jhana with this extremely emaciated body it would be better if were to take solid food such as boiled rice or barley cakes then aggivessans ate solid food such as boiled rice or barley cakes at that time aggivessana had with me five bhikkhus who were attending on me with the hope ‘samana gotama will announce to us the attainment dhamma that he achieves aggivessana when ate solid food such as boiled rice or barley cakes those five bhikkhus were disenchanted with me and left me thinking ‘samana gotamma has taken up the practice of gaining material abundance he has forsaken meditaltion endeavour he secks lit wanders about for ma terial abundance aggivessana after had eaten solid food and had picked up strength being detached from sensual plea sures and demeritorious factors achieved and remained in the first jhana which has vitakka initial application of the mind vicara sustained application of the mind and which has piti delightful satisfaction and sukha bliss born of detachment from the hindrances nivaranas however aggivessana such kind of pleasant sensation also that arose could not overpower my mind and having got rid of vitakka and vicara achieved and remained in the second jhana with internal tranquillity with enhancement of one pointedness of mind devoid of vitakka and vicadra but with piti and sukha born of concen tration however aggivessana such kind of pleasant sensa tion also that arose could not overpower my mind and having been detached from piti as well dwelt in equanimity with mindfulness and clear comprehen sion and experienced sukha in mind and body achieved and remained in the third jhana that which causes person mahdasaccaka sutta who attains it to be praised by the ariyas ass one who has equanimity and mindfulness one who abides in sukha how ever aggivessana such kind of pleasant sensation also that arose could not overpower my mind and by dispelling both pain and pleasure and by the previous disappearance of gladness and sadness achieved and remained in the fourth shana without pleasure and pain state of equanimity and absolute purity of mindfulness however aggivessana such kind of pleasant sensation also that arose could not overpower my mind when the settled mind had thus become per fectly pure cleansed unsullied by defilements uncontami nated by defilements malleable ready for application firm and imperturbable directed it towards attainment of pubbenivasanussati fana the power that recollects existences of the past could recollect many of my existences of the past what could recollect could recollect one past existence or two in this way could recollect my many and varicd past existences together with their characteristics and related facts such as names and clans aggivessana in the first part of the night gained this first vijja psychic knowledge of past existences just as in one who mindfully and strenuously puts forth effort with mind directed to nibbana avijja ignorance of past exist ences disappears vijja psychic knowledge of past exist ences arises darkness disappears and light appears similarly in me avijj disappeared vijja arose darkness disappeared and light appeared however aggivessana such kind of pleasant sensation also that arose could not overpower my mind see bhayabherava sutta para iv mahayamaka vagga when the settled mind had thus become per fectly pure cleansed unsullied uncontaminated malleable ready for application firm and imperturbable directed it towards attainment of cul papata nana the power that can know the passing away of beings and their rebirth in their new destinations with dibbacakkhu fidna the psychic power of divine sight which is extremely clear surpassing the sight of men could see beings in the process of passing away and also of coming into existence inferior or superior beings beautiful or ugly beings beings with good or bad destinations could know about beings arising in accordance with their own kamma actions aggivessana in the middle part of the night gained this seond vijja the psychic power of divine sight just as in one who mindfully and strenuously puts forth effort with mind directed to nibbana avijja lack of psychic power of divine sight disappears vijja the psychic power of divine sight arises darkness disappears and light appears similarly in me avijja disappeared vijja arose dark ness disappeared and light appeared however aggivessana such kind of pleasant sensation also that arose could not overpower my mind when the settle mind had thus become per fectly pure cleansed unsullied uncontaminated malleable ready for application firm and imperturbable directed it towards attainment of dsavakkhayanana the insight which uproots the asavas knew “this is dukkha” as it really is knew “this is the cause of dukkha” as the cause really is knew “this is the extinction of dukkha” as it really is and knew “this is the practice leading to the extinction of dukkha” as it really is knew “these are the asavas” as they really are knew “this is the cause of the asavas” as the cause really is see bhayabherava sutta para mahdsaccaka sutta knew “this is the extinction of savas” as it really is knew “this is the practice leading to the extinction of the asavas” as it really is knowing thus and seeing thus my mind became emancipated from kamasava the defilement of sense deires bhavdsava the defilement of hankering after better existence and avijjasava the defilement of ignorance of the four ariya truths having been emancipated came to know that have becn emancipated that rebirth is no more that the ariya discipline has been cairied out that what needed to be done for attainment of magga insight into nibbana has been done and that nothing else remains to be done for attainment of magga aggivessana in the last part of the night gained this third vijja the insight which uproots asavas just as in one who mindfully and strenuously puts forth effort with mind directed to nibbana avijj lack of insight which uproots savas disappears vijja the insight which uproots asavas arises darkness disappears and light appears similarly in me avijja disappeared vijj arose darkness disappeared and light appeared however aggivessana such kind of pleasant sensation also that arose could not overpower my mind aggivessana recall to mind expounding the dhamma to an audience consisting of many hundreds indeed each and every person in the audience thought about me thus samana gotama is teaching the dhamma exclusively for me but aggivassana this should not be understood this tathagata teaches the dhamma to others only to disseminate knowledge aggivessana at the close of my teaching the dhamma ‘i set my mind as before on nibbana the object of that same arahattaphala concentration in which constantly abide letting my mind settle making it one pointed and establishing firmly on nibbana this statement of the honourable gotama is worthy of credence for it is in the tradition of one who is homage iv mahayamaka vagga worthy having overcome kilesas defilements and who is perfectly self enlightened but honourable gotama do you remember ever sleeping in the day time aggivessana during the last month of the hot season after having had alms food and after leaving the place of the meal remember falling asleep mindful and fully aware lying on my right side on the outer great robe folded four times gotama some samanas and brahmanas say thal this is abiding in stupor aggivessana by this much one does not become either stupeficd or non stupefied but aggivessana listen how one has stupor or does not have stupor pay careful attention shall speak very well gotama replied saccaka niganjhaputta to the bhagava then the bhagava spoke thus aggivessana say that whoever has not got rid of asavas that defile that bring about new existences again and again that cause burning pain that result in dukkha and that give rise to birth ageing and dying in the future one who is stupefied indeed aggivessana one who has not got rid of dsavas is stupefied aggivessana say that whoever has got rid of savas that defile that bring about new existences again and again that cause burning pain that result in dukkha and that give rise to birth ageing and dying in the future is one who is not stupefied indeed agegivessana one who has got rid of savas is not stupefied aggivessana the tathagata has got rid of asavas that defile that bring about new existences again and again that sleep is falling into bhavatiga stream of subconsciousness due to physical tiredness with buddhas and arahats therer is not thina middha sloth and torpor but saccaka equated this kind of sleep with abiding in excesssive dullness of the senses or stupor mahasaccaka sutta cause burning pain that result in dukkha and that give rise to birth ageing and dying in the future he has cut them off at the roots rendered them like palm tree stump and made it impossible for them to come into existence again they cannot arise again in the future aggivessana even as palm tree whose crown is cut off cannot have further growth so has the tathagata got rid of dsavas that defile that bring about new existences again and again that cause burning pain that result in dukkha and that give rise to birth ageing and dying in the future he has cut them off at the roots rendered them like palm tree stump and made it impossible for them to come into existence again they cannot arise again in the future when this had been said saccaka niganthaputta spoke thus to the bhagava wonderful gotama marvel lous gotama the honourable gotama thus repeatedly subjected to such taunts and sarcasm is bright in complexion and serene in countenance in the tradition of one who is homage worthy having overcome kilesas defilemens and who is perfectly self enlightened gotama remember

who is homage worthy having overcome kilesas defilements and who is perfectly self enlightened gotama we are going now we have many things to do there are many things to be done aggivessana you know your own time to take leave then saccaka niganthaputta rose from his seat and left pleased and delighted with what the bhagava had said end of the mahdasaccaka sutta the sixth in this vagga colatanhasankhaya sutta the minor discourse on destruction of craving thus have heard at one time the bhagava was staying in savatthi at pubbdrama monastery the pinnacled building of migaramata visakha during that time sakka king of the devas ap proached the bhagava and having approached and paid homage to the bhagava stood in suttable place having stood in suitable place sakka king of the devas spoke to the bhagava thus “venerable sir by how much briefly is bhikkhu emancipated from defilement due to complete extinction of craving has really accomplished the purpose is really secure from bonds has really completed the noble practice really attained the ultimate goal and become the supreme one among devas and men king of the devas in this teaching bhikkhu may have heard “it is not proper to cling to all dhammas through craving or wrong view that bhikkhu king of the devas who has heard “it is not proper to cling to all dhammas through craving or wrong view knows all dhammas with intuition and having known all dhammas with intuition knows all dhammas with discrimination and having known all dhammas with discrimination experiences certain sensa tion pleasant or painful or neither pleasant nor painful he then abides in the contemplation of impermanence abides in the contemplation of detachment abides in the contemplation of cessation and abides in the contemplation of renunciation in regard to those sensations when he abides in the contemplation of imperma nence abides in the contemplation of detachment abides in the contemplation of cessation and abides in the contempla tion of renunciation in regard to those sensations he grasps at all dhammas they are five khandhas twelve ayatanas and eighteen dhatus iv mahayamaka vagga nothing in the world not grasping he clings to nothing all around not clinging to anything all around he is becalmed of himself he now knows “rebirth is ended the noble prac tice has been accomplished what needed to be done has been done nothing else remains to be done for the attainment of magga s” king of the devas by this much the bhikkhu is emancipated from defilement due to complete extinction of craving has really accomplished the purpose is really secure from bonds has really completed the noble practice really attained the ultimate goal and become the supreme one among devas and men then sakka king of the devas having rejoiced in what the bhagavad had said having expressed his satisfaction and having made obeisance to the bhagava and showing respect vanished then and there at that time the venerable mahamoggallana was sitting near the bhagava then it occurred to him “how is it did that yakkha express his satisfaction of the words of the bhagava with due comprehension or without it would be good if were to try to find out whether that yakkha expressed his satisfaction of the words of the bhagava with due comprehension or without then just as strong man stretches out his bends arm or bends his outstretched arms so also venerable mahamogallana vanished from the pubbarama monastery the pinnacled building of migaramata visakha and appeared among the devas of tavatinisa realm at that time sakka king of the devas was enjoying himself in the ekapundarika garden provided in full force with five hundred musical instruments indigenous to the deva world on seeing the venerable mahamogallana coming in the distance sakka king of the devas set aside those five hundred musical instruments indigenous to the deva world approached the venerable mahamoggallana and said ‘‘ come revered moggallana good is your coming revered moggallana after long time the revered moggallana takes the oppor lunity to come to this deva world may it please the revered culataghasagkhaya sutta moggallana to take seat this seat has been prepared the venerable mahamoggallana sat down on the prepared seat sakka king of the devas having taken low seat sat down in suitable place to sakka king of the devas who had sat down in suitable place the venerable maha moggallana said “sakka king of the devas how did the bhagava teach you briefly the emancipation from defilement due to the complete extinction of craving request you we also would like to be participants in hearing this talk on the dhamma revered moggallana we have many affairs to attend to many things to do in fact we have very little to do for our own selves there are many things to do for the devas of tavatinisa so revered moggallana the dhammas which were well heard well learnt given good attention to and well borne in mind have vanished from us very quickly this revered moggallana happened in the past there was pitched battle between the devas and astras in that battle revered moggallana the devas won while astras were de feated revered moggallana having won that battle was the victor having returned from that battle built palace named vejayanta victory revered moggallana the palace has hundred and one towers each tower having seven hundred rooms with peaked roofs and each room accommo dates seven devis female devas each of whom keeps seven female attendants do you revered moggallana wish to see the delights of the vejayanta palace the venerable maha moggallana remained silent in assent then sakka king of the devas and vessavana the great deva king led the venerable mahamoggallana and approached the vejayanta palace on seeing the venerable ahamoggallana coming in the distance the attendants of sakka king of the devas apprehensive and shy retired to each of their rooms just as daughter in law becomes iv mahayamaka vagga apprehensive and shy at the sight of her father in law so also the attendants of sakka king of the devas became apprehensive and shy and retired to each of their rooms then sakka king of the devas and vessavana the great deva king let the venerable mahamoggallana walk around and roam about the vejayanta palace saying “revered moggallana “see this delight of the vajayanta palace revered moggallana see this delight of the vejayanta palace they also said “‘ this vejayanta palace of kosiya shines forth it is just like place of one who has done deed of merit previously men seeing anything delightful would say ‘it shines forth like the palace of the devas of tavatimisa that vejayanta palace shines forth it is just like place of one who has done deed of merit previously then it occurred to the venerable mahamoggallana “this yakkha sakka remains extremely forgetful it would be good if were to awaken him emotionally” then the venerable mahamoggallana worked up such supernormal power that made the vejayanta place tremble quake and reel by touch of the big toe then the minds of sakka king of the devas vessavana the great deva king and the devas of taavatinisa being shaken by surprise and wonder said friends wonderful and marvellous indeed is the great supernormal power and might of the samana he could even make the vejayanta palace tremble quake and reel by touch of the big toe then the venerable mahamoggallana knowing that sakka king of the devas had become frightened with his hair standing on end spoke thus to sakka king of the devas kosiya how did the bhagava teach you briefly the emancipation from the defilements due to the complete extinc tion of craving request you we also would like to be participants in hearing the talks on the dhamma revered moggallana approached the bhagava and having approached and paid homage to the bhagava stood in suitable place and having stood in suitable culataghdsankhaya sutta sis place spoke to the bhagava thus “venerable sir by how much briefly is bhikkhu emancipated from the defilemants due to the complete extinction of craving has really accom plished the purpose is really secure from bonds has really completed the noble practice really attained ultimate goal and become the supreme one among devas and man when spoke thus revered moggallana the bhagava said to me “king of the devas in this teaching bhikkhu may have heard ‘it is not proper to cling to all dhammas through craving or wrong view’ that bhikkhu king of the devas who had heard it is not proper to cling to all dhammas through craving or wrong view knows all dhamma with intuition and having known all dhammas with intutition knows all dhammas with discrimination and having known all dhammas with discrimination experiences certain sensa

abides in the contemplation of renunciation in regard to those sensations when he abides in the contem plation of impermanence abides in the contemplation of dispassion abides in the contemplation of cessation and abides in the contemplation of renunciation in regard to those sensations he grasps at nothing in the world not grasping he clings to nothing all around not clinging to anything all around he is becalmed of himself he now knows ‘rebirth is ended the noble practice of purity has been accomplished what needed to be done for attainment of magga insight has been done nothing else remained to be done for this attainment of magga by this much bhikkhu is emanci pated from defilements due to the complete extinction of craving has really accomplished the purpose is really secure trom bonds has really completed the noble practice really attained the ultimate goal and become the superme one among devas and men thus revered moggallana did the bhagavad speak to me the emancipation from defilements due to the complete extinction of craving si iv mahayamaka vagga then the venerable mahamoggallana having rejoiced in and being satisfied with what sakka king of the devas had said just as strong man stretches out his bent arm or bends his out stretched arms even so venerable maha moggallana vainshed from the devas of tavatimsa realm and appeared at the pubbarama monastery pinnacled building of migéramata visakha soon after the venerable mahamoggallana had left the female attendents of sakka king of the devas asked sakka king of the devas sir is that person your teacher the exalted one “ladies replied king of the devas that person is not the exalted one who is my teacher he is the revered mahamoggallana my companion in the noble practice “your majesty king of the devas they said it is gain to you it is well gotten for you if your companion in the noble practice possesses such great supernormal power and might the exalted one who is your teacher would be more powerful and marvellous then the venerable mahamoggallana approached the bhagava and having approached and paid his homage to him sat down in suitable place and said “venerable sir does the bhagava remember having briefly taught cel ebrated and powerful yakkha the emancipation from defile ments due to the complete extinction of craving moggallana remember sakka king of the devas approached me and having approached and paid homage to me stood in suitable place and asked me “venerable sir by how much briefly is bhikkhu emancipated from defile ment due to the complete extinction of craving has really accomplished the purpose is really secure from bonds has really completed the noble practice really attained the ulti mate goal and become the supreme one among devas and man when this was said moggallana spoke thus to sakka king of the devas in this teaching sakka king of culatanhdsagkhaya sutta the devas bhikkhu may have heard “it is not proper to cling to all dhammas through craving or wrong view’ that bhikkhu king of the devas who haa heard it is not proper to cling to all dhammas through craving or wrong view knows all dhammas with intuition and having known all dhammas with intuition knows all dhammas with discrimina tion and having known all dhammas with discrimination experiences certain sensation pleasant or painful or neither pleasant nor painful he then

regard to those sensations he grasps at nothing in the world not grasping he clings to nothing all around not clinging to anything all around he is becalmed of himself he also knows “rebirth is ended the noble prac tice has been accomplished what needed to be done for attainment of magga insight has been done nothing else remains to be done for the attainment of magga by this much bhikkhu is emancipated from defilements due to the complete extinction of craving has really accomplished the purpose is really secure from bonds has really completed the noble practice is really attained the ultimate goal and be come the supreme one among devas and men moggallana thus do remember having briefly taught celebrated and powerful yakkha as to the emancipation of bhikkhu from defilements due to the complete extinction of craving thus spoke the bhagava delighted the venerable mahamoggallana rejoiced in what the bhagava had said ind of the culatanhasaikhaya sutta the seventh in this vagga iv mahayamaka vagga mahatanhasankhaya sutta the major discourse on destruction of craving thus have heard at one time the bhagava was staying at the jetavana monastery of anathapindika in savatthi at that time there arose in bhikkhu sa ati the son of fisherman depraved view thus “as understand the dhamma the teaching as taught by the bhagavad it is the same consciousness which migrates and runs on from existence to existence and there is no other besides it that does so many bhikkhus heard that there arose in bhikkhu sati the son of fisherman depraved view thus “as understand the dhamma as taught by the bhagava it is the same consciousness which migrates and runs on from exist ence to existence and there is no other besides it that does so then those bhikkhus approached bhikkhu sati the son of fisherman and asked “is it true avuso sati that there has arisen in you depraved view thus ‘as under stand the dhamma as taught by the bhagava it is the same consciousness which migrates and runs on from existence to existence and there is no other besides it that does so bhikkhu sati was man of superficial learning somewhat familiar with the jatakas from which he learnt that the buddha was vessantara or mahosadha or maha janaka etc in his past existences according to the summing up in each relevant birth story then depraved view occurred to him “corporeality sensation perception and volitional activities cease with the pass ing away of being they do not run on the next existence but consciousness fares along from existence to existence in alagaddipama sutta arittha deviated with all his learnedness but here sati of superficial learning grasped te wrong view of sassata di hi eternalism he was known as sati kevat aputta sati the son of fisherman to distinguish him from other bhikkhus bearing the same name of sati mahatanhdasagkhaya sutta “sirs thus do understand the dhamma as taught by the bhagava it is the same consciousness which migrates and runs on from existence to existence and there is no other besides it that does so then those bhikkhus desiring to dissuade bhikkhu sati from this depraved view questioned him pressed him for confirmation and asked him the reasons for the view saying “‘ say not so avuso sati do not slander the bhagava by misrepresentation slandering the bhagava by misrepre sentation is not good certainly the bhagava would not have spoken thus avuso sati in many ways the bhagavad has pointed out lit spoken of the dependent arising of con sciousness as ‘without causal condition there is no arising of consciousness’ although those bhikkhus questioned him pressed him for confirmation and asked him the reasons bhikkhu sati the son of fisherman stuck firmly to that depraved view which he had pondered on in an absolutely wrong way and said “sirs thus do understand the dhamma as taught by the bhagavad it is the same consciousness which migrates and runs on from existence to existence and there is no other besides it that does so those bhikkhus unable to dissuade bhikkhu sati the son of fisherman from this depraved view approached the bhagavaé made obeisance to him and having sal down al suitable place spoke thus to the bhagava “venerable sir there has arisen in bhikkhu sau the son of fisherman depraved view thus as understand the dhamma as taugt by the bhagava it is the same conscious ness which migrates and runs on from existence to existence and there is no other besides it that does so venerable sir we heard that there had arisen in bhikkhu sati the son of fisherman depraved view thus “as understand the dhamma as taught by the bhagva it is the same consciousness which migrates and runs on from existence to existence and there is no other besides it that does so then venerable sir we iv mahayamaka vagga approached bhikkhu saati the son of fisherman and asked him ‘is it true avuso sati that there has arisen in you depraved view thus as understand the dhamma as taught by the bhagava it is the same consciousness which migrates and runs on from existence to existence and there is no other besides it that does so on being thus asked vener able sir bhikkhu sati the son of fisherman replied to us ‘sirs thus do understand the dhamma as taught by the bhagava it is the same consciousness which migrates and runs on from existence to existence and there is no other besides it that does so then we venerable sir desiring to dissuade bhikkhus sati the son of fisherman from this depraved view questioned him pressed him for confirmation and asked him the reasons for the view saying say not so avuso sati do not slander the bhagava by misrepresen tation slandering the bhagava is not good certainly the bhagava would not have spoken thus avuso sati in many ways the bhagava has pointed out lit spoken of the dependent arising of consciousness as without causal con dition there is no arising of consciousness venerable sir although we questioned him pressed him for confirmation and asked him the reasons bhikkhu sati the son of fisherman stuck firmly to that depraved view which he had pondered on in an absolutely wrong way and said sirs thus do understand the dhamma as taught by the bhagava it is the same consciousness which migrates and runs on from existence to existence and there is no other besides it that does so now that we are unable to dissuade bhikkhu sati the son of fisherman from this depraved view we are informing the bhagava of this matter then the bhagava said to certain bhikkhu “come bhikkhu inform bhikkhu sati the son of fisher man at my instance thus avuso sati the teacher sum mons you the bhikkhu said to the bhagava “very well venerable sir and having approched bhikkhu sati the son mahdtanhasagkhaya sutta of fisherman informed him “avuso sati the teacher summons you” saying “very well avuso to the bhikkhu bhikkhu sati approached the bhagava made obeisance to him and sat in suitable place and the bhagava said to bhikkhu sati the son of fisherman who was thus sitting “is it true sati that there has arisen in you depraved view thus ‘as understand the dhamma as taugh by the bhagava it is the same consciousness which migrates and runs on from existence to existence and there is no other besides it that does so “venerable sir thus do understand the dhamma as taught by the bhagava it is the same consciousness which migrates and runs on from existence to existence and there is no other besieds it that does so “sati what is that consciousness which you speak of ‘““ venerable sir it is that which speak which knows and experiences and which undergoes in this or that exist ence the consequences of good or bad deeds “you empty man void of any chance for magga and phala to whom do you know have ever expounded such teaching you empty man void of any chance for magga and phala have not in many ways pointed out lit spoken of the dependent arising of consciousness as with out causal condition there is no arising of consciousness you empty man void of any chance for magga and phala in spite of this teaching you slander us by attributing to us your own wrong view you have also ruined yourself your own future and have produced much demeritoriousness which will bring you empty man no good but sorrow for long time to come” then the bhagava asked the dbhikkhus “bhikkhus what do you think of this has this bhikkhu sati the son of fisherman even faint glow of under standing in this doctrine and discipline iv mahayamaka vagga “how could this be venerable sir this could not be when this was said bhikkhu sati the son of fisherman sat silent confused with drooping shoulders and bent head downcast and incapable of making an answer then the bhagava finding that bhikkhu sati the son of fisherman was silent confused with drooping shoulders and bent head downcast and incapable of making an answer said to him “empty man you shall be known by this depraved view shall now question the bhikkhus about this wrong view then the bhagava asked the bhikkus “bhikkhus do you too understand the teaching that have expounded in the same way as understood by bhikkhu sati the son of fisherman who slanders us by attributing to us his own wrong view who has ruined himself and has produced much demeritoriousness “no venerable sir indeed the bhagava has in many ways pointed out the dependent arising of consciousness as ‘without causal condition there is no arising of consciousness bhikkhus it is well and good that you have under stood properly the dhamma that have thus taught indeed in many ways have pointed out the dependent arising of consciousness as ‘without causal condition there is no arising of consciousness’ in spite of this teaching this bhikkhu sati the son of fisherman has slandered us by attributing

of nutri ment for the maintenance of beings already in existence or for the assistance of beings coming into existence and what are the four they are firstly the bodily nutriment of gross or fine food secondly the ntriment of sense contact thirdly the nutriment of volition and fourthly the nutriment of con sciousness bhikkhus what is the cause what the origin what the genesis and what the source of these four kinds of nutriment these four kinds of nutriment have craving as cause craving as origin craving as genesis and craving as source bhikkhus what is the cause what the origin what the genesis and what the source of this craving craving has sensation® as cause sensation as origin sensation as genesis and sensation as source bhikkhus what is the cause what the origin what the genesis and what the source of this sensation sensation has contact as cause contact as origin contact as genesis and contact as source from here the theory of cause and effect pajiccasamuppada is set forth not from the first link or the last link but from vital middle link tracing the chain from the link of craving back to the first link ignorance sensation vedana also rendered ‘feeling contact means the coming together of the sense base the sense object and consciousness mahdtaghasaynkhaya sutta bhikkhus what is the cause what the origin what the genesis and what the source of this contact contact

existence arises dependent on bhava rebirth arises dependent on rebirth there arise ageing death grief lamentation pain distress and despair in this way occurs the arising of this entire mass of dukkha this last sub paragraph of para sets forth the theory of cause and effect or dependent origination or conditioned genesis as conditioned arising or as cause and effect from the first link to the last link of the chain showing the successive causes of the arising of the five khandha aggregates clinging upadana strong steadfast attachment to sense ocjects or to ideas and views sometimes rendered grasping bhava is of two kinds upapatti bhava and kamma bhava upapatti bhava is the resultant rebirth process in three states of existence namely existence in eleven sensual realms existence in sixteen fine materiality realms and existence in four non corporeal realms bhava as the cause of jati rebirth or coming into new ex istence is kamma bhava that is the causal process of kamma or volitional activities in deed word and thought and the meatal phenomena associated therewith which produce rebirth because of upadana clinging actions kamma in deed word and thought are performed and these give rise to further existence kamma bhava as term may be translated ‘the kammic causal process to further existence’ and in the pali text it is just in dicated as bhava this entire mass of dukkha the entire sum total of suffering pain affliction distress imperfection impermanence empliness in substantiality insecurity unsatisfactoriness which are identified with the five khandha aggregates any single one of these characteris tics by itself is utterly inadequate as an equivalent term for dukkha mahdatanhasagkhaya sutta thus it has been stated “dependent on re birth there arise

bhikkhu remains contented with robes just suffi cient to protect his body and with food just sufficient to sustain him wherever he goes that bhikkhu carries with him only his requisites just as winged

only his requisitcs thus fully equipped with this group of noble morality he enjoys blameless happiness within himself whenever that bhikkhu sees visible object with the eye he does not take in its characteristics such as male or female nor its secondary details such as expression or behaviour if the faculty of sight is left unguarded such uepraved states of mind as covetousness and

establishes mindfulness in meditation then that bhikkhu dissociates himself from coveting the world of the five aggregates which arc the objects of clinging and abides with his mind free from covetousness therby cleansing his mind of covetousness altogether he dissociates himself from ill will abides with his mind free from ill will and develops goodwill towards all living beings thereby cleansing his mind of ill will altogether he dissociates himself from sloth and torpor abides with his mind free from sloth and torpor with the perception of light mindfulness and comprehension thereby cleansing his mind of sloth and torpor altogether he dissociates himself from restlessness and worry being undistracted he abides with inner peace of mind thereby cleansing his mind of restlessness and worry altogether he dissociates himself from doubt and having overcom doubt he abides without wavering in meritorious dhammas thereby cleansing his mind of doubt altogether bhikkhus take the example of man who did business with borrowed money as his business pros pered he paid up his old debts he also acquired profit with which he could maintain his family then it occurred to him thus “formery worked on borrowed money now my business has prospered have paid up my old debts and acquired profit with which have been able to maintain my family” thereby that man was pleased and delighted and bhikkhus take another example of man af hlicted with disease suffering pain extermely ill having no appetite and losing physical strength afterwards he recovered from that disease his appetite returned and he regained his physical strength then it occurred to him thus “formerly was afflicted with disease suffering pain extremely ill losing iv mahayamaka vagga appetite and physical strength now have recovered from that disease my appetite has returned and have regained my physical strength thereby that man was pleased and delighted and bhikkhus take another example of man con fined in prison later he was released from prison safe and sound and without losing any property then it occurred to him thus “formerly was confined in prison now have been released from prison safe and sound and without losing any property thereby that man become pleased and delighted and bhikkhus take another example of slave who was not his own master but subject to another unable to go about as he pleased later he was freed from slavery becoming once again his own master not subject to another and able to go about as he pleased then it occurred to him thus “formery was slave not my own master but subject to another and unable to go about as pleased now have been freed from slavery becoming once again my own master not subject to another and able to go about as pleased thereby that man was pleased and delighted and bhikkhus take another example of man who carrying all his treasures and wealth travelled on long difficult and dangerous journey where the threat of famine was present later he completed that difficult journey and arrived at village where there was peace and security then it occurred to him thus “formerly travelled on long difficult and dangerous journey where the threat of famine was present now have completed the difficult journey and arrived at the village where there is peace and security thereby that man was pleased and delighted mahdassapura sutta even so bhikkhus bhikkhu clearly sees the five hindrances which have not been got rid of from within himself as indebtedness disease imprisonment enslavement and difficult and dangerous journey bhikkus bhikkhu clearly sees the discarding of the five hindrances from within himself as gaining freedom from indebtedness freedom from disease freedom from imprison ment freedom from enslavement and as reaching place of safety discarding the five hindrances that cause de filement of the mind and weakening of intellect that bhikkhu being detached from sensual pleasures and being detached from demeritorious factors achieves and remains in the first jhana which is accompanied by vitakka vicdra and which has piti and sukha born of detachment from the hindrances nivarana he soaks drenches permeates and suffuses his body with piti and sukha born of detachment from hin drances there is no place in his body not suffused with piti and sukha born of detachment from the hindrances bhikkhus take the example of skilful bath atten dant or his assistant who strews bath powder in brass dish sprinkles and sprinkles water on it and makes it into mass water permeating through that mass to form cake soked with unguents inside and out is unable to seep out bhikkhus in the same way that bhikkhu soaked drenches permeates and suffuses his body with piti and sukha born of detachment from the hindrances there is no place in his body not suffused with piti and sukha born of detachment from the hindrances and again bhikkhus having got rid of vitakka and vicara the bhikkhu achieves and remains in the second jhana with internal tranquillity with enhancement of one pointedness of mind devoid of vitakka and vicara but with piti and sukha born of concentration he soaks drenches permeates and suffuses his body with piti and sukha bom of concentration there is no place in his body not suffused with piti and sukha born of concentration iv mahayamaka vagga bhikkhus take the example of deep lake with water welling up from spring below there is no inlet from either east or west or north or south the rains do not come heavily or regularly and yet cool water which wells up from that spring soaks drenches permeates and suffuses the lake with it and there is no place in that lake not suffused with it bhikkhus in the same way that bhikkhu soaks drenches permeates and suffuses his body with piti and sukha born of concentration there is no place in his body not suffused with them and again bhikkhus having been detached from piti as well that bhikkhu dwells in equanimity with mindfulness and clear comprehension and experiences sukha in mind and body he achieves and remains in the third jhana for which the ariyas praise him as one who abides in happiness who is possessed of equanimity and mindfulness he soaks drenches permeates and suffuses his body with sukha detached from piti there is no place in his body not suffused with sukha detached from piti bhikkhus to give an example there are uppala paduma and pundarika lotuses in pond where they grow in the water and thrive in it even when they are submerged they thrive under water soaked drenched permeated and suffused from root to apex with cool water there is no spot in the whole plant of uppala paduma or pundarika lotuses not suffused with it bhikkhus in the same way that bhikkhu soaks drenches permeates and suffuses his body with sukha de tached from piti and there is no place in his body which is not diffused with sukha detached from pili and again bhikkhus by dispelling both plea sure and pain and by the previous disappeasnce of gladness and sadness that bhikkhu achieves and remains’in the fourth mahdassapura sutta jhana which has neither pain nor pleasure but has purity of mindfulness born of equanimity he abides in the purity of mind suffused in his body there is no place in his body which is not suffused with it bhikkhus take the example of man sitting wrapped up from head to foot in white cloth leaving” no place on his whole body uncovered by it bhikkhus in the same way that bhikkhu abides in the purity of mind suffused in his body and there is no place in his body which is not suffused with it and again bhikkhus when the concentrated mind has thus become purified pellucid unblemished unde filed malleable pliable firm and imperturbable that bhikkhu directs his mind to knowledge of past existences pubbeniva sanussati hana he recollects many and varied existences of the past and what does he recollect he recollects one past existence also two existences in this way he recollects his many and varied past existences together with their charac teristics and related facts such as names and clans bhikkhus take the example of man who travelled from one own village to another village then from there to another village and then he returned from there to his own village then it might occur to him thus “i went out from my village to certain village in that village stood thus sat thus spoke thus and remained silent thus then again sect out from that village to still another village in that village too stood thus sat thus spoke thus and remained silent thus then returned from that village to my own village in the same way bhikkhus that bhikkhu recollects one past existence also two existences in this way he recollects many and varied past existences together with their characteristics and related facts such as names and clans iv mahayamaka vagga and again bhikkhus when the concentrated mind has thus become purified pellucid unblemished unde filed malleable pliable firm and imperturbable that bhikkhu directs his mind to knowledge of the passing away and arising of being cutipapata nana with the divine power of sight which is extremely clear surpassing the sight of man he sees beings in the process of passing away and also of arising inferior or superior beings beautiful or ugly beings with good or bad destinations he knows beings arising according to their own kamma for example bhikkhus there were two houses with doors opposite each other man with good eye sight stand ing in the middle between them might see men entering the house or comming out of it or walking about or roaming about there in the same way bhikkhus with the divine power of sight which is extremely clear surpassing the sight of men that bhikkhu sees beings in the process of passing away and also of arising inferior or superior beings beavtiful or ugly beings beings with good or bad destinations he knows beings arising according to their own kamma and again bhikkhus when the concentrated mind has thus become purified pellucid unblemished unde filed malleable pliable firm and unperturbable that bhikkhu directs his mind to knowledge of the extinction of moral intoxicants asavakkhaya nana then he understands truly that this is dukkha he understands truly that this is the origin of dukkha he understands truly that this is the cessation of dukkha he understands truly that this is the way leading to the cessation of dukkha he understands truly that these are the asavas he understands truly that this is the origin of asavas he understands truly that this is the cessation of asavas and he understands truly that this is the way leading lo the cessation of asavas the mind of the bhikkhu who mahdaassapura sutta thus knows and thus sees is liberated from kamasava the defilement of sense pleasures his mind is liberated from bhavasava the defilmenteof hankering after better existence and his mind is liberated from avijjasava the defilement of ignorance when the mind was thus liberated there oc curred the knowledge “it is liberated” he knows “rebirth is ended the noble practice has been accomplished what needed to be done for the realization of the path has been done nothing else remains to be done for this attainment of magga for example bhikkhus there was clear and trans parent lake in mountain glen man with good eye sight standing at the edge of the lake might see mussels pebbles broken pottery and shoals of fish moving about or just lying sull it might occur to him thus “this lake is clear and transparent in it there are oysters mussels pebbles broken pottery and shoals of fish either moving about or just lying still in the same way bhikkhus he understands truly that this is dukkha nothing else remains to be done for the attainment of magga bhikkhus this bhikkhu is called samana or brahmana or one who has washed himself nhataka or one who has attained to the highest knowledge vedagt or one who has crushed the defilements sotthiya or one who has kept himself aloof from defilement araham bhikkhus how is bhikkhu samana that bhikkhu has calmed down evil and demeritorious dhammas that bring about defilements that cause repeated birth and that result in birth ageing and death in the future thus that bhikkhu is samana bhikkhu how is bhikkhu brahmana that bhikkhu has put away evil and demeritorious dhammas that bring about defilements that cause repeated birth and that result in iv mahayamaka vagga birth ageing and death in the future thus that bhikkhu is brahmana bhikkhus how is bhikkhu one who has washed himself that bhikkhu has washed himself clean of evil and demeritorious dhammas that bring about defilements that cause repeated birth and that result in birth ageing and death in the future thus that bhikkhu is one who has washed himself bhikkhus how is bhikkhu one who has attained to the highest knowledge that bhikkhu has comprehended evil and demeritorious dhammas that bring about defilements that cause repeated birth and that result in birth ageing and death in the future thus that bhikkhu is one who has attained to the highest knowledge bhikkhus how is bhikkhu one who has crushed the defilements that bhikkhu has crushed evil and demeritorious dhammas that bring about defilements that cause repeated births and that result in birth ageing and death in the future thus that bhikkhu is one who has crushed the defilement bhikkhus how is bhikkhu one who has kept himself aloof from the defilements that bhikkhu has kept himself away from evil and demeritorious dhammas that bring about defilements that cause repeated rebirth and that result in birth ageing and death in the future thus that bhikkhu is one who has kept himself aloof from defilements bhikkhus how is bhikkhu an arahani that bhikkhu has kept himself away from evil and demeritorious dhammas that bring about defilements that cause repeated birth and that result in birth ageing and death in the future thus that bhikkhu is an arahani thus spoke the bhagava delighted those bhikkhus rejoiced in what the bhagava had said end of the mahdassapura sutta the ninth in this vagga cuil aassapura sutta the short discourse delivered at the assapura market town thus have heard at one time the bhagava was staying in the province of anga princes in assapura market town there the bhagava addressed the bhikkhus saying “bhikkhus ’’and those bhikkhus answered the bhagava saying “venerable sir and the bhagava spoke thus bhikkhus people know you well as “samanas samanas” and you when you are asked “what are you admit we are samanas’” bhikkhus you who are thus designated and who acknowledge the designation should train yourselves hus we shall take up the practice fitting for samanas thereby our designation will be true and our acknowledgement of ourselves will become real we use the robes alms food lodgings medicines and medicinal req uisites for use in sickness donated by the laity their actions will prove to be of great fruit and great benefit and our going forth will not prove futile literally barren but be full of fruits and growth bhikkhus how does bhikkhu not take up the practice befitting samana bhikkhus bhikkhu being grossly covetous does not get rid of covetousness being malevolent in mind does not get rid of malevolence being wrathful does

that conduce to woeful states and to suffering in wretched desti nations declare that he does not practise as befitting samana for example bhikkhus there was weapon called mataja made out of dead bird double edged whetted sharp covered and bound in leather bhikkhus say that the going forth of this bhikkhu is just like that weapon bhikkhus do not declare one to be samana who wears stitched clothes merely by his wearing stitched clothes bhikkhus neither do declare one to be samana who is naked merely by his being naked bhikkhus neither do declare one to be samana who lives with dust and dirt

ditferent cranes finally iron filings are recovered they are then wrought into sharp weapons by skilful blacksmith weapon thus processed is know as mataja weapon culassapuca sutta bhikkhus if one

bhikkhus in this world see some person who wears stitched clothes but who is covetous malevolent in mind wrath ful hostile given to denigrating others given to rivalry envious avaricious deceitful full of guile having evil desires holding wrong views so do not declare him to be samana by merely wearing stitched clothes bhikkhus if one who is naked who lives with dust and dirt who gets into the

with clear water sweet water cool water limpid water with good landing place and man from the east weze to come along oppressed by the summer heat scorched by the sum mer heat exhausted and feeling hungry and thirsty having come there he might quench his thirst and rid himself of oppressive summer heat and man from the west were to come along man from the north were to come along man fram the south were to come along man from whalever quarter were to come along oppressed by the summer heat scorched by the summer heat exhausted and fecling hungry and thirsty having come there he might

exhaustion he becomes samana through the extinction of dsavas thus spoke the bhagava delighted those bhikkhus rejoiced in what the bhagava had said nd of culasasapura sutta the tenth in this vagga end of mahayamaka vagga the fourth division namo tassa bhagavato arahato sammasambuddhassa colayamaka vagga saleyyaka sutta verafijaka sutta mahavedalla sutta cilavedalla sutta cijadhammasamadana sutta mahadhammasamadana sutta vimamsaka sutta nm bp www id kosambiya sutta brahmanimantanika sutta maratajjaniya sutta sale yyaka sutta discourse made at sala village thus have heard at one time the bhagava journeying through the country of the kosalans with large number of bhikkhus of the order arrived at sala village of the brahmanas the brahmin householders of sala heard thus “friends samana gotama the son of the sakyan clan who had gone forth from the sakyan family journeying through the country of the kosalans with large number of bhikkhus of the order has arrived at la the good reputation of the honourable gotama has spread far and wide in this way thus indeed that bhagava is worthy of special veneration he truly com prehends all the dhammas by his own intellect and insight he possesses penetrative knowledge and the per fect course of practice he speaks only what is beneficial and true he knows all the three worlds he is incompa rable in taming those who deserve to be tamed he is the teacher of devas and men he is the enlightened one knowing and teaching the four ariya truths and he ts the most exalted “through special apperception that bhagava having personally realized the world comprising devas mara and brahmas and also the world of human beings with its samanas and brahmanas kings sammutidevas and men expounds it he proclaims the dhamma which is excellent at the beginning excellent at the middle and excellent at the end with richness in meaning and words he reveals the noble practice which is complete in all aspects and is absolutely pure it were good to see arahats of this nature culayamaka vagga then the brahmin householders of sala approached the bhagava and having approached some made obei sance to the bhagavad and sal in suitable place some exchanged courteous greetings with the bhavaga after having concluded amiable and memorable words they sat in suitable place some raised their joined palms to the forehead in the direction of the bhagava and sat in suitable place some announced their names and clans and sat in suitable place some just sat down in silence in suitable place having sat in suitable place the brahmin house holders of sala addressed the bhagavad thus gotama what is the cause what is the reason why some beings in this world on the dissolution of their bodies after death appear in the miserable existences in wretched destinations in states of ruin in realms of continuous suffering and gotama what is the cause what is the reason why some beings in this world on the dissolu tion of their bodies after death appear in good desti nation the happy world of the devas householders it is because of unjust and uneven action that some beings in this world on the dissolution of their bodies after death appear in the miserable existences in wretched destinations in states of ruin in realms of continuous suffering householders it is be cause of just and even action that some beings in this world on the dissolution of their bodies after death appear in good destination the happy world of the devas we do not understand the meaning of what the revered gotama has said in brief without explaining it in detail we request the revered gotama to be so good as to teach us the dhamma so that we may understand saleyyaka sutta ji the meaning of what the revered gotama has said in brief without explaining it in detail if that be so householders listen and pay good attention will speak “very well sir responded the brahmin house holders of sala to the bhagava and the bhagava spoke thus householders there are three kinds of unjust and uneven bodily action four kinds of unjust and uneven verbal action and three kinds of unjust and uneven mental action householders how are there the three kinds of unjust and uneven bodily action in this world house holders there is certain person who takes life is cruel bloody handed bent on doing harm and killing show ing no mercy on sentient beings and he takes what is not given he takes what ever property or building belonging to others situated in village or in jungle with intent to steal and he indulges in wrongful gratification of sen sual pleasures he falls into sexual transgression with women protected by the mother protected by the father protected by both the mother and the father protected by brothers protected by sisters protected by relations protected by the clan protected by companions in the dhamma protected by the betrothed and to say the least with those garlanded as token of betrothal thus householders there are the three kinds of unjust and uneven bodily action householders how are there four kinds of un just and uneven verbal action in this world house holders certain person speaks falsehood when he is taken before an assembly or congregation or amidst relations or amidst an organization or royal family culayamaka vagga and asked as witness “o man come here say what you know he replies know ”’’ although he does not know he replies do not know although he knows he replies see ’’ although he does not see and he replies do not see ’’ although he sees thus does he speak falsehood knowing it to be falsehood either for his own sake or for the sake of another or for the sake of some material gain and he makes malicious speech what he hears from this man he relates to that man to create dissention and what he hears from that man he relates to this man to create dissention in this way does he sow discord among those living in harmony he encourages those who are living in discord delighting in disharmony rejoicing in disharmony finding pleasure in disharmony he makes speech that creates disharmony and he makes harsh speech he speaks such words as are crude rough galling to other’s ears hurt ful bordering on wrath and not conducive to concentra tion and he uses frivolous speech he speaks words at wrong lime not related to facts not conducive to benefit not aligned with dhamma not in accordance with the discipline he speaks words that are unreason able unlimited not conducive to welfare and not worth treasuring in mind at wrong time thus householders there are the four kinds of unjust and uneven verbal action householders how are there the three kinds of unjust and uneven mental action in this world house holders certain person is grossly covetous he covets other people’s property thinking “how good it will be if what belongs to others becomes mine and he is malevolent in mind he has wicked intentions thinking ‘“ may these beings be ill treated sdleyyaka sutta tif may these beings be killed may these beings be cut up may these beings be destroyed may these beings not cxist af all disappear ”’ and he is of wrong view and of perverted view holding thus “‘ there is no

be falsehood whether for his own sake or for the sake of another or for the sake of some material gain and he abandons thoughts of making mali cious specch and abstains from making malicious speech what he hears from this man he does not relate to that mian to create dissention and what he hears from that man he does not relate to this man to’ create dissention in this way he reconciles those who are at variance and encourages those living in unity delighting in harmony saleyyaka sutta iis rejoicing in hamony finding pleasure in harmony he makes speech that creates harmeny and he abandons making harsh speech and ab stains from making harsh speech he speaks such words as are not blameworthy pleasing to the ear affectionate going to the heart courteous pleasing to many and heartening to many and he abandons thoughts of making frivo lous speech and abstains from making frivolous speech he speaks words at the right time factually beneficially in alignment with the dhamma in accordance

“how good it will be if what belongs to others becomes mine and he ts not malevolent in mind he has no wicked intentions thinking “may these beings be tree from enmity free from anxiety and free from suffering may they be able to maintain themselves without diffi culty” and he is of right view he has the unperverted view holding thus “there is consequence in alms giv ing there is consequence in making sacrificial offer ing there is consequence in giving small gifts there is fruit or resultant for doing good or evil deeds there is this present world for those who are in the other world there is the other world for those who are in the present world there is the result of good or bad behaviour towards one’s own mother there is the culayamaka vagga result of good or bad behaviour towards

mal knowledge what is the reason for this it is because he conducts himself justly and evenly as this had been said the brahmin house holders of sala village addressed the bhagava thus gotama excellent is the dhamma gotama excel lent is the dhamma just as gotama one has turned up what lies upside down just as one has uncovered what lies covered just as one shows the way to another who lost just as one holds up lamp in the darkness for those with eyes to see visible objects even so have you revealed the dhamma to us in various ways we take refuge in the revered gotama we take refuge in the dhamma we take refuge in the samgha may the revered gotama accept us as lay disciples taking refuge in the three gems from today till the end of our lives end of saleyyaka sutta the first in this vagga here the buddha was silent on the devas of asafifidsatta abode the abode of the unconscious as the practice leading to existence in that totally unconscious state is un buddhistic belonging to the teaching of ascetics outside the buddha‘s teaching veranjaka sutta discourse made to householders of veranja thus have heard at one time the bhagava was staying at jetavana monastery of anathapindika in savatthi then the brahmin householders of verafija were staying in savatthi to do some business the brahmin householders of veranja heard thus “friends samana gotama the son of the sakyan clan who has gone forth from the sakyan family is staying at jetavana monastery of anathapindika in savatthi the good reputation of the honourable gotama has spread far and wide in this way “thus indeed that bhagava is worthy of special veneration he truly com prchends all the dhammas by his own intellect and insight he possesses penetrative knowledge and the per fect course of practice he speaks only what is beneficial and true he knows all the three worlds he is incompa rable in taming those who deserve to be tamed he is the teacher of devas and men he is the enlightened one knowing and teaching the four ariya truths and he is the most exalted “through special apperception that bhagava hav ing personally realized the world comprising devas maras and brahmas and also the world of human beings with its samanas and brahmanas kings sammutidevas and men expounds on it he proclaims the dhamma which is excellent at the beginning excellent at the middle and excellent at the end with richness in meaning and words he reveals the noble practice which is complete in all aspects and is absolutely pure it were good to see the arahats of this nature then the brahmin householders of veranyja approached the bhagava and having approached some made obeisance to th bhagava and sat in suitable cllayamaka vagga place some exchanged courteous greetings with the bhagava and having finished felicitous and memorable words sat in suitable place sore raised their joined palms in the direction of the bhagava and sat in suitable place some announced their names and clans and sat in suitable place some just sat down in silence and sat in suitable place having sat in suitable place the brahmin house holders of verafija addressed the bhagava thus “o gotama what is the cause what the reason that some beings in this world on the dissolution of their bodies after death appear in the miserable existences in wretched destinations in states of ruin in realms of continuous suffering and gotama what is the cause what the reason that some beings in this world on the dissolution of their bodies after death appear in good destination the happy world of the devas householders it is because of unjust and uneven action that some beings in this world on the dissolution of their bodies after death appear in the miserable existences in wretched destinations in states of ruin in realms of continuous suffering householders it is be cause of just and even action that some beings in this world on the dissolution of their bodies after death appear in good destination the happy world of the devas we do not understand the meaning of what the revered gotama has said in brief without explaining it in detail we request the revered gotama to be so good as to teach us the dhamma so that we may understand the meaning of what the revered gotama has said in brief without explaining it in detail if that be so householders listen and pay good attention will speak “very well sir responded the brahmin house holders of veranja to the bhagavad and the bhagava spoke thus veratjaka sutta householders there are three kinds of unjust and uneven bodily action four kinds of unjust and uneven vertal action and three kinds of unjust and uneven mental action householders how are there the three kinds of unjust and uneven bodily action in this world house holders certain person takes life is cruel bloody handed bent on doing harm and killing showing no mercy on sentient beings and he takes what is not given he takes whatever property or building belonging to others with intent to steal and he indulges wrongful gratification of sensual pleasures he falls into sexual transgression with women protected by the mother thus household ers there are the three kinds of unjust and uneven bodily actions householders how are there the four kinds of unjust and uneven verbal action in this world house holders someone speaks falsehood when he is taken before an assembly he speaks falsehood knowing it to be falsehood and he makes malicious speech what he hears from this man he relates to that man in this way does he sow discord among those liying in harmony and he makes harsh speech he speaks such words as are crude and he uses frivolous words in speech he speaks words at the wrong time he speaks words unlimited not con ducive to welfare thus householders there are the four kinds of unjust and uneven verbal action householders how are there the three kinds of unjust and uneven mental action in this world household ers certain person is grossly covetous thinking “how good it will be if what belongs to others becomes mine and he is malevolent in mind he has wicked intentions thinking “may these beings be ill treated may these beings not existat all disappear and he culayamaka vagga is of wrong view and of perverted view holding thus “there is no consequence in alms giving there is no consequence in making secrificial offering there are no samanas or brahmanas who proclaim fhis world and the other world thus householders there are the three kinds of unjust and uneven mental action householders it is because of unjust and uneven mental action that some beings in this world on the dissolution of their bodies after death appear in miser able existences in wretched destinations in states of ruin and in realms of continuous suffering householders there are three kinds of just and even bodily action four kinds of just and even verbal action and three kinds of just and even mental action householders how are there the three kinds of just and even bodily action in this world household ers certain person abandons thoughts of taking life and abstains from destruction of life he has laid down the stick and the sword he is ashamed of doing evil he is merciful he dwells with solicitude for the wel fare of all beings and he abandons thoughts of taking what is not given and abstains from taking what is not given he does not take whatever property or building belong ing to others with intent to steal and he abandons thoughts of wrongful grati fication of sensual pleasures and abstains from indulging in sensual pleasures he does not fall into sexual transgression with women thus householders there are the three kinds of just and even bodily action householders how are there the four kinds of just and

there is consequence in making sacrificial offer ing there are samanas and brahmanas who estab lished in the noble path and accomplished in good practice proclaimed this world and the other world thus

the emancipation by intuitive knowledge free from asavas due to their ex haustion realise here and now by his own supernormal knowledge what is the reason for this it is because he conducts himself justly and evenly as this had been said the brahmin house holders of verafija addressed the bhagava thus “o gotama excellent is the dhamma gotama exccl lent is the dhamma just as gotama one has turned up what lies upside down just as one has uncovered what lies covered just as one shows the way to another culayamaxa vagga who is lost just as one holds up lamp in the darkness for those with eyes to see visible objects even so have you reveled the dhamma to us in various ways we tak refuge in the revered gotama we take refuge in the dhamma we take refuge in the sanigha may the re vered gotama accept us as lay disciples taking refuge from today till the end of our lives end of verafnjaka sutta the second in this vagga mahavedalla sutta the major vedalla discourse of questions and answers thus have heard at one time the bhagava was staying at the jetavana monastery of anathapindika in savatthi then in the evening the venerable mahakojthika arising from solitary meditation approached the venerable riputta and exchanged greetings with the venerable riputta bringing to conclusion the courteous and amiable greetings the venerable mahakotthika sat in suitable place and said thus to the venerable sariputta your reverence it is said ‘one without insight one without insight panfia why your reverence is it said one without insight’ your reverence he is without insight of whom it is said he does not understand he does not understand’ what does he not understand he does not understand this is dukkha’ he does not understand mahavedalla sutta ‘this is the cause of dukkha’ he does not understand ‘this is the cessation of dukkha’ he does not under stand ‘this is the course of practice leading to the cessation of dukkha’ it is said of him he does not understand he does not understand’ and there fore your reverence such one is said to be ‘one without insight’ bie “good your reverence ’’ said the venerable mahakojtthika delighted and salisficd with what the venerable sdriputta had said and asked the venerable sariputta further question your reverence it is said ‘one who has insight one who has insight’ why your reverence is it said ‘one who has insight’ your reverence he has insight of whom it is said he understands he understands’ what does he understand he understands ‘this is dukkha’ he under stands ‘this is the cause of dukkha’ he understands not knowing really and truly that the five khandhas physical and mental phenomena are to be identified with dukkha thus not knowing the anya truth of dukkha not knowing really and truly that the cause the source of dukkha is craving thus not knowing the anya truth of the ongio of dukkha not knowing really and truly that dukkha and the cause of dukkha become extinct through realization of nibbana thus not knowing the anya truth of cessation of dukkha not knowing really and truly that the anya path of eight constituents is the course of practice that leads to nibbana which means extinction and absence of dukha thus not know ing the anya truth of the path one lacking magga insight of at least the first stage the commentary says that though person may be very learned in the pifaka texts and in the commentanes if he does not intensively practise vipassana insight meditation and does not perceive the impermanence anicca dukkha and insubstanti ality anatta of phenomena he can be called only man of learning and not ‘one with insight tv culayamaka vagga ‘this is the cessation of dukkha’ he understands this is the course of practice leading to the cessation of dukkha’ it is said of him he understands he understands’ and therefore your reverence such one is said to be ‘one who has insight’ your reverence it is said ‘consciousness con sciousness vififidana why your reverence is it said ‘consciousness’ your reverence it is said of it ‘it cognizes it cognizes’ therefore it is said to be ‘consciousness’ what does it cognize it cognizes pleasantness it cognizes unpleasantness it cognizes neither unpleasantness nor pleasantness it is said of it ‘it cognizes it cognizes’ therefore your reverence it is said to be ‘conscious ness’ your reverence are these factors of insight and consciousness associated or are they dissociated is it possible to separate these factors singly so as to bring out the difference between them your reverence these factors of insight and consciousness are associated and not dissociated it is not possible to separate these factors singly so as to bring out the difference between them what is under one endowed with magga insight of at least the first stage or of the three higher stages consciousness vere it indicates the consciousness of person who engages in vipassana insight meditation practice by meditating on the true nature of conditioned phenomena this vipassana consciousness leads on to attainment of magga insight associated they arise together cease together have the same sense object and have the same base here what is meant is “are magga insight and mappa consciousness associated or separate are vipassana insight and vipassana consciousness associated or separate the questioner is not mixing up magga insight which is supramundane with vipassana consciousness which is mundane mahadvedalla sutta stood through magga insight is cognized by magga consciousness what is cognized by vipassana con sciousness is understood through vipassana insight therefore these factors are associated and not dissoci ated it is not possible to separate these factors singly so as to bring out the difference between them your reverence what is the difference between these factors of insight and consciousness which are lassociated and not dissociated your reverence of these factors of insight and consciousness which are associated and not dissociated magga insight is to be cultivated and vipassana consciousness is to be accurately known this is the difference between them your reverence it is said ‘sensation sensation vedana why your reverence is it said ‘sensation’ your reverence it is said of it ‘it experiences it experiences’ therefore it is said to be ‘sensation’ what does it experience it experiences pleasantness it experiences unpleasantness it experiences neither unpleasantness nor pleasantness it is said of it ‘it expe riences it experiences’ therefore your reverence it is said to be ‘sensation’ ie to develop magga insight implying development of magga consciousness to discern accurately vipassana consciousness implying discernment of vipassana insight sensation here by sensation is meant mundane sensation in the realms of existence this sensation is the subject of vipassaua insight meditation the supramunodane sensation of magga and phala states is not referred to here cullayamaka vagga your reverence it is said ‘perception perception saffia why your reverence it is said “perception’ your reverence it is said of it it perceives it perceives’ therefore it is said to be ‘perception’ what does it perceive it perceives what is dark blue what is yellow what is red and what is white it is said of it it perceives it perceives’ therefore your reverence it is said to be ‘perception’ your reverence are these phenomena of sensa tion perception and consciousness associated or are they dissociated is it possible to separate these phenom ena singly so as to bring out the difference among them your reverence these phenomena of sensation perception and consciousness are associated and not dissociated it is not possible to separate these phenom ena singly so as to bring out the difference among them your reverence what is experienced is perceived what is perceived is cognized therefore these phenomena are associated and not dissociated it is not possible to separate these phenomena singly so as to bring out the difference among them perception here by perception is meant mundane perception in the realms of existence this perception is the subject of vipassana insight meditation the supramundane perception of magga and phala states is not referred to here the commentary on this sutta makes this distinction relating to knowledge gained through safifia perception viiiiana consciousness and panna insight in vipassana practice perception merely takes note of the sense object as blue yellow or red consciousness also takes note of them but with the knowledge that all conditioned things are subject to the law of anicca dukkha and anatta but it cannot bring forth magga insight insight encompasses all knowledge stemming from perception and consciousness and can lead to magga insight mahavedalla sutta your reverence what can be known by means of the absolutely pure fourth jhana conscious ness which is independent of the five sense faculties your reverence the sustained attainment samapatti of kasanaficayatana which concentrates on the concept ‘space is infinite’ can be known by means of the absolutely pure fourth jhana consciousness which is independent of the five sense faculties so also the sustained attainment sam patti of vifianaficayatana which concentrates on the concept ‘consciousness is infinite’ can be known so also the sustained attain ment samapatti of akificanfiayatana which concen trates on the concept ‘nothing is there’ can be known your reverence with what is the phenomenon that can be known understood your reverence the phenomenon that can be known is understood with the eye of insight your reverence what is the purpose of in sight your reverence the purpose of insight the attainment of special apperception ’® accurate knowl edge and abandonment your reverence how many conditions are there for the arising of right view leading to vipassana insight and magga insight here what is meant is that the higher aripa jhanas are possible only after the fourth jhana purpose altha also rendered goal aim benefil special apperception abhinfia knowledge of the nature and distinguishing characteristics of physical and mental phenom ena accurate knowledge parnna accurate understanding of the physical and mental aggregates as subject to anicca dukkha and anatta abandonment pahdna getting rid of all demeritorious factors through magga insight culayamaka vagga your reverence the voice of another such as the teaching of the buddha or of disciple of the buddha ard proper consideration of the true natur of phenomena are the two conditions that bring about right view your reverence these are the two condi tions for the arising of right view your reverence how many factors are there which assist right view to result in emancipation of mind arahattaphala samadhi and in the benefit of emancipation of mind and to result in emancipation through insight arahattaphala pafifia and in the benefit of emancipation through insight your reverence there are five factors which assist right view to result in emancipation of mind and in the benefit of emancipation of mind and to result in emancipation through insight and in the benefit of eman cipation through insight in this sasana your reverence right view is supported by the practice of morality by hearing the dhamma by discussion on meditation by the practice of concentyation relating to jhana and samapatti and by vipassana insight meditation right view assisted by these five factors results in emancipa tion of mind and in the benefit of emancipation of mind and results in emancipation through insight and in the benefit of emancipation through insight your reverence how many kinds of existence are there your reverence there are three namely exist ence in the sensual realms existence in the fine materi emancipation from all kilesas moral defilements after describing the emancipation of person with insight here the text goes on to describe the round of existences which will be the lot of person without insight mahavedalla sutta ality realms and existence in the non materiality realms your reverence how does coming again into future existence occur your reverence coming again into future exist ence occurs to beings who are bound by the hindrance of ignorance and the fetter of craving and who take great delight in this or that existence your reverence how does coming again into future existence not occur your reverence with the absence of ignorance the arising of arahatta magga knowledge and the cessation of craving comming again into future exist ence does not occur your reverence what is the first jhana your reverence in this sasana bhikkhu be ing detached from sensual pleasures and demeritorious factors enters upon and abides in the first jhana which has vitakka initial application of the mind vicara sustained application of the mind and which has piti delightful satisfaction and sukha bliss born of detach ment from hindrances nivaranas this your rever ence is called the first jhana your reverence how many factors are there in the first jhana your reverence there are five factors in the first jhadna in this sasana your reverence in the bhikkhu entering upon the first jhana there occur vitakka existence is to be taken in two aspects the volitional activities directed to sensual realms or fine matenality realms or non materality realms as well as the ansing of the khandhas through these volitional activities see footnote to para mahataghasatkhaya sutta this question on the first jhana is asked because the text after dealing in para with the emancipation of an arahat will go on to deal with nirodhasamapatti to attain which the first jhana is the first step cullayamaka vagga initial appication of the mind vicara sustained applica tion of the mind piti delightful satisfaction sukha bilss and cittekaggata one pointedness of mit thus your reverence there are five factors in the first jhana your reverence how many factors does the first jhana dispel and how many does it possess your reverence the first jhana dispels five factors and possesses five factors in this sasana your reverence the bhikkhu entering upon the first jhana gets rid of desire for sense pleasure gets rid of malevo lence gets rid of sloth and torpor gets rid of restlessness and worry and gets rid of uncertainty but there occur in him vitakka initial application of the mind vicdra sustained application of the mind piti delightful satis faction sukha bliss and cittekaggata one pointedness of mind your reverence thus the first jhana dispels five factors and has five factors your reverence there are these five sense faculties each having its own sense object each having its own range each not experiencing the sense object in the range of any other sense faculty namely the faculty of sight the faculty of hearing the faculty of smell the faculty of taste and the faculty of touch what is the cardinal factor behind these five sense faculties each having its own sense object each having its own range each not experiencing the sense object in the range of any other sense faculty and what is the factor that experiences sense objects in the range of those sense faculties your reverence indeed there are these five sense faculties each having its own sense object each having its own range each not experiencing the senses one pointedness of mind in intense concentration the cardinal factor behind pafisarana lit refuge shelter protection mahdvedalla sutta object in the range of any other sense faculty namely the facultics of sight hearing smell taste and touch your reverence the cardinal factor behind these five sense facultics cach having its own sense object each having its own range each not experiencing the sense object in the range of any other sense faculty is the impulsion of mind the impulsion of mind experi ences sense objects in the range of those sense facul tics your reverence there are these five sense facultics namely the faculty of sight the faculty of hearing the faculty of smell the faculty of taste and the faculty of touch your reverence depending on what do these five sense faculties exist your reverence these five sense faculties namely the facultics of sight hearing smell taste and touch exist depending on life principle your reverence depending on what does life principle exist your reverence life principle exists depending on body heat your reverence depending on what does body heat exist your reverence body heat exists depending on life principle your reverence from what the venerable sariputta has just said we learn that life principle exists depending on body heat and from what the venerable ariputta has just said we learn that body heat exists depending on life principle your reverence how should the meaning of these statements be taken eye consciousness or ear consciousness simply takes note ol what is seen or heard without attachment or revulsion or bewilderment it is impulsive consciousness javana of the thought process that reacts to sights sound etc with attach ment or revulsion or bewilderment culayamaka vagga your reverence in that case will give you simile in this world ome wise people understand the menrning of statement when simile is given just as your reverence light becomes evident because of the flame of burning oil lamp and just as the flame becomes evident because of the light even so life principle exists depending on body heat and body heat exists depending on life principle your reverence are life processes the same as the phenomena of sensation or are life processes one thing and the phenomena of sensation another your reverence life processes are not the same as the phenomena of sensation indeed if life processes were the same as the phenomena of sensation no emergence from nirodhasamapatti can take place lit can become evident for bhikkhu who has entered upon the attainment of cessation of perception and sen sation nirodhasamapatti it is because life processes can become evident for bhikkhu who has entered upon the attainment of cessation of perception and sen sation nirodhasamapatti it is because life processes and the phenomena of sensation are different that bhikkhu who has entered upon the sustained attainment of cessa tion of perception and sensation can emerge from that attainment life processes ayasankhara bodily life processes or constitu ents of life are according to the commentary simply ‘life’ if life processes were the same as sensation these would cease together with sensation and perception in the sustained attainment of cessation of consciousness nirodhasama patti making it impossible for the bhikkhu to emerge from that samapalti mahavedalla sutta your reverence what factors disappear from this body so that it lies cast away and flung aside as if it were lifeless log your reverence when the three factors life principle body heat and consciousness disappear from this body it lies cast away and flung aside as if it were lifeless log your reverence what is the difference between dead man who has completed his time and bhikkhu who enters upon the sustained attainment of cessation of perception and sensation your reverence in dead man who has com pleted his time volitional activities of the body in breathing and out breathing cease and disappear voli tional activities of speech vitakka and vicara initial and sustained applications of the mind cease and disappear volitional activities of mind perception and sensation cease and disappear life principle becomes extinct body heat disappears sense faculties are broken asunder in bhikkhu entering upon the sustained attainment of cessa tion of perception and sensation volitional activities of the body in breathing and out breathing cease and disappear volitional activities of speech vitakka and vicdra initial and sustained applications of the mind cease and disappear and volitional activities of mind perception and sensation cease and disappear but life principle docs not become extinct body heat does not disappear sense faculties are intact and extraordinarily clear this your reverence is the difference between them between dead man and bhikkhu who has entered upon the cessation of perception and sensation your reverence how many conditions are there for the sustained attainment of emancipation of lifeless itsmindless acetana kalangato this is just synonymous phrase for dead man cullayamaka vagga mind in which there is neither pain nor pleasure your reverence there are four conditions for the sustained attainment of emancipation of mind in which there is neither pain nor pleasure your rever ence in this sasana bhikkhu by dispelling both pain and pleasure and by the previous disappearance of gladness and sadness enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana state of equanimity without pain and pleasure and with absolute purity of mindfulness your reverence these are the four conditions®® for the sus tained attainment of emancipation of mind in which there is neither pain nor pleasure your reverence how many conditions are there for the sustained attainment of emancipation of mind that is signless where marks or attributes of condi tione phenomena are absent your reverence there are two conditions for the sustained attainment of emancipation of mind that is signless they are not directing attention to all signs sense objects and directing attention to the signless element nibbana where marks or attributes of condi tioned phenomena are absent your reverence these are the two conditions for the sustained attainment of emancipation of mind that is signless here nevasafifianasaiia jhaoa the jhana of neither percep tion consciousness nor non perception non con sciousness is referred to this jhana is an indispensable and immediate prelude to entering upon nirodhasamapatti four conditions the dispelling of physical pain the dispelling of physical pleasure the absence of gladness the absence of sadness here the phalasamapatti absorption in fruition mind of bhikkhu who has emerged from nirodhasamapatti is referred to in this case the fruition mind follows the emergence immediately and takes place only once or at most twice after which bhavahga mind is reverted to mahavedalla sutta your reverence how many conditions are there for the continuance of the emancipation of mind that is signless where marks or attributes of sense objects are absent your reverence there are three conditions for the continuance of the emancipation of mind that is signless they are not directing attention to all signs sense object directing attention to the signless element nibbana where attributes of conditioned phenom ena are absent and prior determination of the attain ment your revernce these are the three conditions for the continuance of the emancipation of mind that is signiess your reverence how many conditions are there for emergence from the emancipation of mind that is signless your reverence there are two conditions for emergence from the emancipation of mind that is signless they are directing attention to all signs sense objects not directing attention to the signless element nibbana where attributes of conditioned phenomena

mahakothika rejoiced in what the venerable sariputta had said end of the mahavedalla sutta the third in this vagga coi avedalla sutta the shorter vedalla discourse of questions and answers thus have heard at one time the bhagava was staying in rajagaha at the veluvana grove the feeding place of black squirrels then visakha layman devotee approached bhikkhuni dhammadinna and having thus approached and paid homage to her sat in suitable place and said to bhikkhuni dhammadinna honourable madam it is said “sakkaya sakkaya bodily entity what is called sakkaya by the bhagava friend visakha the bhagava has said that sakkaya is these five aggregates which are the objects of clinging namely the aggregate of corporeality which is the objet of clinging the aggregate of sensation which is the object of clinging the aggregate of perception which is the object of clinging the aggregate of voli iional activitics which is the object of clinging and the aggregate of consciousness which is the object of cling ing friend visakha the bhagava has said that these five aggregates which are the objects of clinging are sakkaya former husband of dhammadinna before she became bhikkhuni sakkaya bodily entity is misconception for the reality of the five khandhas physical and mental aggregates sakkaya ditthi the view that there is bodily entity is an illusion of self as distinct entity in regard to the manifestation of one’s khandhas and is wrong view as the concept of sakkaya is the basis for belief in atta self soul ego sakkaya can be rendered approximately as ‘individuality but ‘individuality ‘besides meaning distinct catity has also connotations which may be misleading culayamaka vagga “good honourable madam “said layman devo tee visakha delighted with what bhikkhuni dhammadinna had said anu having expressd his satisfaction asked bhikkhuni dhammadinna further question honourable madam it is said origin of sakkaya origin of sakkaya honourable madam what is called origin of sakkaya by the bhagava friend visakha the bhagava has said that the origin of sakkaya is the craving tanha which gives rise to fresh rebirth and accompanied by strong attach ment finds great delight in this or that existence namely craving for sense pleasures craving for contin ued existence and craving for no further existence annihilation of self honourable madam it is said “cessation of sakkaya cessation of sakkaya honourable madam what is called cessation of sakkaya by the bhagava craving for sense pleasures kamatagha hankering after and becoming attached to pleasures of the senses craving for continued existence bhavatanha hankering after and becoming attached to continued existence espe cially for better and higher existence either in the current sensual existence or in the ripa fine materiality or arpa non material brahma realms or becoming attached to the rupa and aripa jhanas this is due to clinging to the view that there can be no ending to existence in one form or another and that atta self is eternal this view is known as sassata di hi or eternity view craving for no further existence vibhavatanha han kering after and becoming attached to the idea that there is no kamma for rebirth and hence no future existence this is the annihilation theory and is due to clinging to the view that there is no existence after death those who accept the reality of atta self and who also hold this view believe in and crave for annihilation of atta self after death this view is known as uccheda difthi culavedalla sutta friend visakha it is the cessation through com plete non attachment of this same craving its abandon ing and discarding the liberation and detachment from it this in fact is realization of nibbana this friend visakha is declared by the bhagava as cessation of sakaya honourable madam it is said ‘the course lead ing to cessation of sakk ya the course leading to cessa tion of sakkaya what is called by the bhagava the coure of practice leading to cessation of sakkaya friend visakha the bhagavad has declared the ariya path of eight constituents as the course of practice leading to cessation of sakkaya the eight constituents are right view right thinking right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mind fulness and right concentration honourable madam is clinging the same as the five aggregates which are the objects of clinging or is clinging distinct from the five aggregates which are the objects of clinging friend visakha that clinging is neither the same as the five aggregates which are the objects of clinging nor distinct from the five aggregates which are the objects of clinging friend visakha it is the desire for and attachment to the five aggregates which are the objects of clinging that is called clinging honourable madam how does the view of sakkaya sakkaya ditthi come to be clinging upadana is craving and wrong view upadana is neither the same as the aggregates nor apart from them be cause it is included in saikharakkhandha aggregate of voli tional activities culayamaka vagga friend visakha in this matter an ignorant worldling who habitually disregards the ariyas who is not profi ciént the teachings of the ariyas who is not trained and disciplined in the teachings of the ariyas who habitually disregards men of virtue who is not proficient in the teachings of men of virtue who is not trained and disciplined in the teachings of men of virtue regards corporeality as atta self’ regards the remaining aggre gates as atta having corporeality or regards corporeality as existing in alta or atta as existing in corpore ality and regards sensation as atta perception as atta volitional activities as atta regards consciousness as atta or regards the remaining aggre gates as atta having consciousness or regards con sciousness as existing in atta or atta as existing in the view that corporeality and atta are identical as the flame and the light it sheds are wrongly taken to be identical the view that only the mental aggregates are atta which has corporeality as tree has its shadow the view that corporeality is in atta as scent is in flow ers corporeality is taken as separate from atta the view that atta is in corporeality as ruby is contained in treasure chest atta is taken as separate from corporeality culavedalla sutta consciousness thus friend visakha does the view of sakkaya come to be honourable madam hew does the view of sakkaya not come to be riend visakha in this matter learned ariya disciple who pays attention to the ariyas who is pro ficient in the teachings of the ariyas who is trained and disciplined in the teachings of the ariyas who pays attention to men of virtue who is proficient in the teachings of men of virtue who is trained and disci plined in the teachings of men of virtue does not regard corporeality as atta self does not regard the remain ing aggregates as atta having corporeality does not regard corporeality as existing in atta does not regard atta as existing in corporeality and docs not regard sensation as atta perception as atta volitional activities as atta does not regard consciousness as in considering corporeality as beig identical with atta only corporeality by itself is taken as atta in considering atta as possessing corporeally or as containing corporeality or as being contained in corporeality alta is equated only with nama the mental component mind of mind and body so also when sensation or percepion or volitional activity or consciousness is considered as being identical with atta only the mental component mind is taken as atta but in considering atta as possessing sensation or perception or volitional activity or consciousness or as containing or as being contained in any one of these four both mind and body the mental component and corporeality conjointly are taken as atta the view that corporeality or sensation or perception or volitional activity or consciousness is iden tical with atta is the annihilation view the view that atta possesses or contains or is contained in any one of these five kkhandhas is the view that the separate and distinct atta is elernal kkonwn as the eternity view does not regard corporeality as atta he only contemplates the impermanence the dukkha and the insubstantiality of the khandhas culayamaka vagga atta does not regard the remaining aggregates as alta having consciousness does not regard consciousness as existing in atta does not regard atta as existing in consciousness thus friend visakha the view of sakkaya does not come to be honourable madam what is the ariya path of eight constituents friend visakha it is just this ariya path consist ing of eight constituents namely right view right thinking right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration honourable madam is the ariya path of eight constituents conditioned or unconditioned friend visakha the ariya path of eight con

three groups are not in cluded in the ariya path of eight constituents but the ariya path of eight constituents is included in the three groups friend visakha right speech right action and right livelihoods are included in the group of morality stlakkhandha right effort right mindfulness and right concentration are included in the group of concen tration samadhikkhandha right view and right

accessories for con centration what is the development of concentration friend visakha one pointedness of mind is con the three groups the group of morality the group of concentration and the group of wisdom culavedalla sutta centration the four methods of steadfast mindfulness are the conditions for gaining concentration the four right exertions are the necessary accessories for concentration the practice cultivation and repeated exercise of those factors herein constitute development of concentration honourable madam how many kinds of volitional activities are there friend visakha there are

activity of the body why are vitakka and vicara called volitional activity of speech and why are perception and sensation called volitional activity of mind lriend visakha breathing and out breathing are of the body these are phenomena bound up with the body so in breathing and out breathing are called voli tional activity of the body friend visakha having first applied thought vitakka and having kept it sustained vicara speech is ullered subsequently so vitakka and vicara are called volitional activity of speech perception in breathing and out breathing are prominent among the bolitional activilics pertaining to the body vitakka and vicira are prominent among the volitional aciivilies pertai ning to speech percepuon and sensation are prominent among the volitional activities pertaining to mind culayamaka vagga and sensation are of the mind these are phenomena bound up with the mind so perception and sensation are called volitional activity of minc honourable madam how does the sus tained absorption in cessation of perception and sensa tion nirodhasamapatti come to be riend visakha to bhikkhu who is entering upon the cessation of perception and sensation there does not arise the thought ‘i shall attain the cessation of perception and sensation or ‘i am attaining the cessa tion of perception and sensation or ‘j have attained the cessation of perception and

sensation which factors arise first the volitional activity of the body or the volitional activity of speech or the volitional activity of mind friend visakha in the bhikkhu who is emerging from the cessation of perception and sensation the voli tional activity of mind arises first then the volitional activity of the body then the volitional activity of speech honourable madam how many kinds of con tact touch the bhikkhu who has emerged from the sustained absorption in cessation of perception and sen sation lriend visakha the bhikkhu who has emerged from the sustained attainment of cessation of perception in the nirodhasamapatti this translation also is paraphrase in person emerging from nirodhasamapatti the fruition mind simultancously with perception and sensation arises first cwlayamaka vagga and sensation is touched by three kinds of contact namely contact that is void contact that is signless free from marks or attrinutes and contact that is without desire honourable madam to what does the mind of the bhikkhu who has emerged from sustained absorption of perception and sensation incline lean and lead friend visakha the mind of the bhikkhu who has emerged from the

friend visakha there are these three kinds of sensation namely pleasant sensation unpleasant sensa tion and neither unpleasant nor pleasant sensation honourable madam what is pleasant sensation what is unpleasant sensation and what is neither unpleas ant nor pleasant sensation friend visakha whatever is felt by body or by mind as pleasant or agreeable is pleasant sensation whatever is felt by body or by mind as unpleasant or disagreeable is unpleasant sensation and whatever is felt void sufinata void of kilesas moral defilements signless animitta without the marks or attributes of kilesas without desire appagihita without the kilesas of desire or attachment these terms actually characterize phalasamapatti sustained absorption in fruition and the contact that arises simulta neously with fruition mind is also characterized by these terms the fruition mind that arises after nirodhasamapatti occurs only once in another way these three terms are epithets for nibbana characterized by the absence of sense object attributes and desire or attachment the contact that arises simultaneously with the lruition mind which is directed to nibbana is also characterived by these epithets culavedalla sutta by body or by mind as neither agreeable nor disagree able is neither unpleasant nor pleasant sensetion honourable madam how is pleasant sensation pleasant and how is it unpleasant how is unpleasant sensation pleasant and how is it unpleasant and how is neither unpleasant nor pleasant sensation pleasant and how is it unpleasant friend visakha pleasant sensation while pres ently

vagga tendency to repugnance lie latent in all unpleasant sen sations does the tendency to ignorance lie latent in all neither unpleasant nor pleasant sensations friend visakha not in all pleasant

is there and to be got rid of not in all unpleasant sensations the tendency to repugnance is there and to be got rid of not in all neither unpleasant nor pleasant sensations the tendency to ignorance is there and to be got rid of friend visakha in this sdsana bhikkhu de tached from sensual pleasures and demeritorious factors enters upon and abides in the first jhana which has vitakka initial application of the mind and vicara sustained application of the mind and which has pili delightful satisfaction and sukha bliss born of detach ment from the hindrances nivaranas he gets rid of attachment raga through that jhana there is no latent tendency to attachment in that first jhana culavedalla sutta in this sdsana friend visakha bhikkhu re flects ‘when shall enter upon and abide in that state of arahattaphala the fruition of the magga of an arahat which the ariyas are now entering upon and abiding in in the bhikkhu who yearns thus for the unsurpassed liberation arahattaphala distress arises because of his yearning he gets rid of repugnance by means of that distress therefore the tendency to repugnance does not lie latent in that distress in this sadsana friend visakha bhikkhu by dispelling both pain and pleasure by the previous disap pearance of gladness and sadness enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana without pain and pleasure state of equanimity and absolute purity of mindfulness by means of that fourth jhana ignorance is got rid of and the tendency to ignorance does not lie latent in that fourth jhana honourable madam what is the counter part of

meanings includ ing region sphere locus place base spot position occasion as matter of fact patigha repugnance dissatisfaction or sensory reaction cannot be dispelled by domanassa dis tress itself through resolving that distress shall not arise and through energetic striving in vipassana practice anagami magega is attained it is that anagdémi magga which dispels repugnance in the case of pleasant sensation unpleasant sensation or ignorance the counterpart of each is antithetical counter part in the case of neither unpleasant nor pleasant sensation or magga knowledge or emancipation the counterpart of each is complementary counterpart cullayamaka vagga friend visakha the counterpart of unpleasant sensation is pleasant sensation honourable madam what is the counterpast of neither

madam what is the counterpart of emancipation friend visakha the counterpart of emancipation is nibbana honourable madam what is the counterpart of nibbana friend visakha the question has gone too far it is not possible to reach the limit of such quéstionings indeed friend visakha the noble practice of purity brahmacariya merges into nibb na has its final goal in nibbana and ends in nibbana friend visakha if you so desire go to the bhagava and ask him to explain this matter bear in mind the explanation of the bhagava then visdkha the layman devotee being delighted and satisfied with what bhikkhuni dhammadinna had said rose from his seat paid homage to her and departed respectfully he approached the bhagava paid homage to him took his seat in suitable place and related to the bhagava all that had been said between him and bhikkhuni dhammadinna when he had recounted thus the bhagava said to visakha the layman devotee visakha bhikkhuni culavedalla sutta dhammadinna is wise vesakha bhikkhuni dhamadinna is of great knowledge had you visakha asked me the answers to your questions too would have answered it in the same way as bhikkhuni dhammadinna had answered these are the answers to the questions and bear the answers thus spoke the bhagavad delighted visakha the layman devotee rejoiced in what the bhagava had said end of the cdlavedalla sutta the fourth in this vagga coladhammasamadana sutta the shorter discourse on undertaking the practice of the dhamma thus have heard at one time the bhagava was staying at jetavana monastery of anathapindika in savatthi then the bhagava addressed the bhikkhus saying “bhikkhus ”” the bhikkhus responded to the bhagava saying “venerable sir the bhagava spoke thus bhikkhus there are four kinds of undertaking of the practice of the dhamma what are the four bhikkhus there is the pleasant undertaking of the practice of the dhamma in the present which results in unhappiness in the future there is the unpleasant undertaking of the practice of the dhamma in the present which results in the unhappiness in the future there is unpleasant under taking of the practice of the dhamma in the present which results in happiness in the future there is the culayamaka vagga pleasant undertaking of the practice of the dhamma in the present which results in happiness in the future bhikkhus what is the pleasant undertax ing of the practice of the dhamma in the present which results in unhappiness in the future there are bhikkhus certain samanas and brahmanas who say thus and hold the view thus “there is no evil effect of pleasures they come to the enjoyment of sense pleasures and gratify themselves with female wanderers wearing top knots they say thus “seeing what future danger in sense pleasures do those revered samanas and brahmanas speak of getting rid of sense pleasures and declare that sense pleasures must be overcome pleasant is the touch of this young female wanderer with soft downy arms and they come to indulge in sense pleasures having come to indulge in sense pleasures on the dissolution of their bodies after death they appear in miserable exist ences in wretched destinations in states of ruin and in realms of continuous suffering there they expreience painful feelings severe bitter and acute then they say thus “those revered samanas and brahmanas seeing this future danger in sense pleasures speak of getting rid of sense pleasures and declare that sense pleasures must be overcome indeed we on account of sense pleasures originating in sense pleasures experience painful feelings severe bitter and acute for example bhikkhus suppose during the last part of the hot season there were the ripe fruit of maaluva creeper which splits open and lets its seed fall at the root of sal tree then bhikkhus the grardian deva residing in the sal tree being afraid and alarmed comes trembling then bhikkhus the friends acquain to take upon oneself the pleasures of sense objects of eye ear nose tongue and body is natural phenomenon so enjoyment of pleasurable objects is no offence say certain samanas and brahmanas culadhammasamadana sutta tances and kith and kin of that guardian deva residing in that sal tree such as devas of parks devas of forests devas of trees devas of medicinal rlents grasses and giant trees gather around him and comfort him say ing be not afraid dear friend be not afraid dear friend either peacock might swallow the creeper’s seed or deer might eat it or forest fire might burn it or woodsman might take it away or white ants might infest it or it might not germinate but bhikkhus neither does peacock swallow the creeper’s seed nor deer eat it nor forest fire burn it nor woodsman take it away nor white ants infest it but it germinates with heavy rainfall in the onset of the monsoons it grows well it is young soft and downy with its branches clinging it finds its sup port in that sal tree then bhikkhus it might occur to the guardian deva residing in that sal tree thus seeing what kind of future danger in the ma luva creeper seed did those friends acquaintances and kith and kin such as revered devas of parks devas of forests devas of trees devas of medicinal plants grasses and giant trees gather around me and comfort me saying “be not afraid dear friend be not afraid dear friend either peacock might swallow the luva creeper’s seed or deer might eat it or forest fire might burn it or woods man might take it away or white ants might infest it or it might not germinate the touch of this creeper young soft and downy with its branches clinging is pleasant then that creeper might twine itself round and round that sal tree having entwined itself it might cntangles itself on the forks of the branches having entangled itself it might come down dangling and might break the bigger and bigger branches then bhikkhus it might occur to the guardian deva residing in that sal tree thus culayamaka vagga ‘“ my friends acquaintances and kith and kin such as revered devas of parks devas of forests devas of trees devas of medicinal plants grasses and giant trees seeing future danger in the creeper’s seed gather around me and comfort me saying be not afraid dear friend be not afraid dear friend either peacock might swallow the creeper’s seed or deer might eat it or forest fire might burn it or woodsman might take it away or white ants might infest it or it might not germinate but beacuse of the creeper’s seed experi ence painful feelings severe bitter and acute even so bhikkhus there are certain samanas and brahmanas who say thus and hold the view thus “there is no evil effect of sense pleasures” they come to the enjoyment of sense pleasure and they gratify themselves with the female wanderer wearing top knots they say thus “seeing what future danger in sense pleasures do revered samanas and brahmanas speak of getting rid of sense pleasures and declare that sense pleasures must be overcome pleasant is the touch of this young female wanderer with soft downy arms and they come to indulge in sense pleasures having come to indulge in sense pleasures on the dissolution of their bodies after death they appear in miserable exist ences in wretched destinations in states of ruin and in realms of continuous suffering there they experience painful feelings severe bitter and acute then they say hus “those revered samanas and brahmanas seeing this future danger in sense pleasures speak of getting rid of sense pleasures and declare that sense pleasures must be overcome indeed we on account of sense pleasures originating in sense pleasures experience painful feel ings severe bitter and acute bhikkhus this is the pleasant undertaking of the practice of the dhamma in the present which results in unhappiness
