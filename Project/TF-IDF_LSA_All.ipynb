river be hiddekel that be it which goeth toward the east of assyria and the fourth river be euphrates and the lord god take the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it and the lord god command the man say of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die and the lord god say it be not good that the man should be alone will make him an help meet for him and out of the ground the lord god form every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever adam call every living creature that be the name thereof and adam give name to all cattle and to the fowl of

woman because she be take out of man therefore shall man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and they be both naked the man and his wife and be not ashamed now the serpent be more subtil than any beast of the field which the lord god have make and he say unto the woman yea hath god say ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman say unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the tree of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which be in the midst of the garden god hath say ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it l ye die and the serpent say unto the woman ye shall not surely die for god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eye shall be open and ye shall be a god know good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree be good for food and that it be pleasant to the eye and tree to be desire to make one wise she take of the fruit thereof and do eat and give also unto her husband with her and he do eat and the eye of them both be open and they knew that they be naked and they sew fig leaf together and make themselves apron and they heard the voice of the lord god walk in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the tree of the garden and the lord god call unto adam and say unto him where art thou and he say heard thy voice in the garden and be afraid because be naked and hid myself and he say who told thee that thou wast naked hast thou eat of the tree whereof command thee that thou shouldest not eat and the man say the woman whom thou gavest to be with me she give me of the tree and do eat and the lord god say unto the woman what be this that thou hast do and the woman say the serpent beguile me and do eat and the lord god say unto the serpent because thou hast do this thou art curse above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the day of thy life and will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel unto the woman he say will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth child and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee and unto adam he say because thou hast hearken unto the voice of thy wife and hast eat of the tree of which command thee say thou shalt not eat of it curse be the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the day of thy life thorn also and thistle shall it

until even and whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even then come the child of israel even the whole congregation into the desert of zin in the first month and the people abode in kadesh and miriam die there and be bury there and there be no water for the congregation and they gather themselves together against moses and against aaron and the people chode with moses and spake say would god that we have die when our brother die before the lord and why have ye brought up the congregation of the lord into this wilderness that we and our cattle should die there and wherefore have ye make u to come up out of egypt to bring u in unto this evil place it be no place of seed or of fig or of vine or of pomegranate neither be there any water to drink and moses and aaron go from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and they fell upon their face and the glory of the lord appear unto them and the lord spake unto moses say take the rod and gather thou the assembly together thou and aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eye and it shall give forth his water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so thou shalt give the congregation and their beast drink and moses take the rod from before the lord a he command him and moses and aaron gather the congregation together before the rock and he say unto them hear now ye rebel must we fetch you water out of this rock and moses lift up his hand and with his rod he smote the rock twice and the water come out abundantly and the congregation drank and their beast also and the lord spake unto moses and aaron because ye believe me not to sanctify me in the eye of the child of israel therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which have give them this be the water of meribah because the child of israel strove with the lord and he be sanctify in them and moses sent messenger from kadesh unto the king of edom thus saith thy brother israel thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen u how our father go down into egypt and we have dwelt in egypt long time and the egyptian vexed u and our father and when we cry unto the lord he heard our voice and sent an angel and hath brought u forth out of egypt and behold we be in kadesh city in the uttermost of thy border let u pas pray thee through thy country we will not pas through the field or through the vineyard neither will we drink of the water of the well we will go by the king high way we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left until we have pass thy border and edom say unto him thou shalt not pas by me l come out against thee with the sword and the child of israel say unto him we will go by the high way and if and my cattle drink of thy water then will pay for it will only without do anything else go through on my foot and he say thou shalt not go through and edom come out against him with much people and with strong hand thus edom refuse to give israel passage through his border wherefore israel turn away from him and the child of israel even the whole congregation journeyed from kadesh and come unto mount hor and the lord spake unto moses and aaron in mount hor by the coast of the land of edom say aaron shall be gather unto his people for he shall not enter into the land which have give unto the child of israel because ye rebel against my word at the water of meribah take aaron and eleazar his son and bring them up unto mount hor and strip aaron of his garment and put them upon eleazar his son and aaron shall be gather unto his people and shall die there and moses do a the lord command and they go up into mount hor in the sight of all the congregation and moses strip aaron of his garment and put them upon eleazar his son and aaron die there in the top of the mount and moses and eleazar come down from the mount and when all the congregation saw that aaron be dead they mourn for aaron thirty day even all the house of israel and when king arad the canaanite which dwelt in the south heard tell that israel come by the way of the spy then he fought against israel and take some of them prisoner and israel vowed vow unto the lord and say if thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand then will utterly destroy their city and the lord hearken to the voice of israel and deliver up the canaanite and they utterly destroyed them and their city and he call the name of the place hormah and they journeyed from mount hor by the way of the red sea to compass the land of edom and the soul of the people be much discourage because of the way and the people spake against god and against moses wherefore have ye brought u up out of egypt to die in the wilderness for there be no bread neither be there any water and our soul loatheth this light bread and the lord sent fiery serpent among the people and they bit the people and much people of israel die therefore the people come to moses and say we have sin for we have spoken against the lord and against thee pray unto the lord that he take away the serpent from u and moses prayed for the people and the lord say unto moses make thee fiery serpent and set it upon pole and it shall come to pas that every one that be bitten when he looketh upon it shall live and moses make serpent of brass and put it upon pole and it come to pas that if serpent have bitten any man when he beheld the serpent of brass he live and the child of israel set forward and pitch in oboth and they journeyed from oboth and pitch at ijeabarim in the wilderness which be before moab toward the sunrising from thence they remove and pitch in the valley of zared from thence they remove and pitch on the other side of arnon which be in the wilderness that cometh out of the coast of the amorites for arnon be the border of moab between moab and the amorites wherefore it be say in the book of the war of the lord what he do in the red sea and in the brook of arnon and at the stream of the brook that goeth down to the dwell of ar and lieth upon the border of moab and from thence they go to beer that be the well whereof the lord spake unto moses gather the people together and will give them water then israel sang this song spring up well sing ye unto it the prince digged the well the noble of the people digged it by the direction of the lawgiver with their stave and from the wilderness they go to mattanah and from mattanah to nahaliel and from nahaliel to bamoth and from bamoth in the valley that be in the country of moab to the top of pisgah which looketh toward jeshimon and israel sent messenger unto sihon king of the amorites say let me pas through thy land we will not turn into the field or into the vineyard we will not drink of the water of the well but we will go along by the king high way until we be past thy border and sihon would not suffer israel to pas through his border but sihon gather all his people together and go out against israel into the wilderness and he come to jahaz and fought against israel and israel smote him with the edge of the sword and possess his land from arnon unto jabbok even unto the child of ammon for the border of the child of ammon be strong and israel take all these city and israel dwelt in all the city of the amorites in heshbon and in all the village thereof for heshbon be the city of sihon the king of the amorites who have fought against the former king of moab and take all his land out of his hand even unto arnon wherefore they that speak in proverb say come into heshbon let the city of sihon be built and prepared for there be fire go out of heshbon flame from the city of sihon it hath consume ar of moab and the lord of the high place of arnon woe to thee moab thou art undone people of chemosh he hath give his son that escape and his daughter into captivity unto sihon king of the amorites we have shot at them heshbon be perish even unto dibon and we have laid them waste even unto nophah which reacheth unto medeba thus israel dwelt in the land of the amorites and moses sent to spy out jaazer and they take the village thereof and drove out the amorites that be there and they turn and go up by the way of bashan and og the king of bashan go out against them he and all his people to the battle at edrei and the lord say unto moses fear him not for have deliver him into thy hand and all his people and his land and thou shalt do to him a thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites which dwelt at heshbon so they smote him and his son and all his people until there be none left him alive and they possess his land and the child of israel set forward and pitch in the plain of moab on this side jordan by jericho and balak the son of zippor saw all that israel have do to the amorites and moab be sore afraid of the people because they be many and moab be distressed because of the child of israel and moab say unto the elder of midian now shall this company lick up all that be round about u a the ox licketh up the grass of the field and balak the son of zippor be king of the moabites at that time he sent messenger therefore unto balaam the son of beor to pethor which be by the river of the land of the child of his people to call him say behold there be people come out from egypt behold they cover the face of the earth and they abide over against me come now therefore pray thee curse me this people for they be too mighty for me peradventure shall prevail that we may smite them and that may drive them out of the land for wot that he whom thou blessest be bless and he whom thou cursest be curse and the elder of moab and the elder of midian depart with the reward of divination in their hand and they come unto balaam and spake unto him the word of balak and he say unto them lodge here this night and will bring you word again a the lord shall speak unto me and the prince of moab abode with balaam and god come unto balaam and say what men be these with thee and balaam say unto god balak the son of zippor king of moab hath sent unto me say behold there be people come out of egypt which covereth the face of the earth come now curse me them peradventure shall be able to overcome them and drive them out and god say unto balaam thou shalt not go with them thou shalt not curse the people for they be bless and balaam rise up in the morning and say unto the prince of balak get you into your land for the lord refuseth to give me leave to go with you and the prince of moab rise up and they go unto balak and say balaam refuseth to come with u and balak sent yet again prince more and more honourable than they and they come to balaam and say to him thus saith balak the son of zippor let nothing pray thee hinder thee from come unto me for will promote thee unto very great honour and will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me come therefore pray thee curse me this people and balaam answer and say unto the servant of balak if balak would give me his house full of silver and gold cannot go beyond the word of the lord my god to do less or more now therefore pray you tarry ye also here this night that may know what the lord will say unto me more and god come unto balaam at night and say unto him if the men come to call thee rise up and go with them but yet the word which shall say unto thee that shalt thou do and balaam rise up in the morning and saddle his as and go with the prince of moab and god anger be kindle because he go and the angel of the lord stood in the way for an adversary against him now he be rid upon his as and his two servant be with him and the as saw the angel of the lord stand in the way and his sword drawn in his hand and the as turn aside out of the way and go into the field and balaam smote the as to turn her into the way but the angel of the lord stood in path of the vineyard wall be on this side and wall on that side and when the as saw the angel of the lord she thrust herself unto the wall and crush balaam foot against the wall and he smote her again and the angel of the lord go far and stood in narrow place where be no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left and when the as saw the angel of the lord she fell down under balaam and balaam anger be kindle and he smote the as with staff and the lord open the mouth of the as and she say unto balaam what have do unto thee that thou hast smitten me these three time and balaam say unto the as because thou hast mocked me would there be sword in mine hand for now would kill thee and the as say unto balaam be not thine as upon which thou hast ridden ever since be thine unto this day be ever wont to do so unto thee and he say nay then the lord open the eye of balaam and he saw the angel of the lord stand in the way and his sword drawn in his hand and he bow down his head and fell flat on his face and the angel of the lord say unto him wherefore hast thou smitten thine as these three time behold go out to withstand thee because thy way be perverse before me and the as saw me and turn from me these three time unless she have turn from me surely now also have slain thee and save her alive and balaam say unto the angel of the lord have sin for knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me now therefore if it displease thee will get me back again and the angel of the lord say unto balaam go with the men but only the word that shall speak unto thee that thou shalt speak so balaam go with the prince of balak and when balak heard that balaam be come he go out to meet him unto city of moab which be in the border of arnon which be in the utmost coast and balak say unto balaam do not earnestly send unto thee to call thee wherefore camest thou not unto me be not able indeed to promote thee to honour and balaam say unto balak lo be come unto thee have now any power at all to say any thing the word that god putteth in my mouth that shall speak and balaam go with balak and they come unto kirjathhuzoth and balak offer ox and sheep and sent to balaam and to the prince that be with him and it come to pas on the morrow that balak take balaam and brought him up into the high place of baal that thence he might see the utmost part of the people and balaam say unto balak build me here seven altar and prepare me here seven ox and seven ram and balak do a balaam have spoken and balak and balaam offer on every altar bullock and ram and balaam say unto balak stand by thy burnt offering and will go peradventure the lord will come to meet me and whatsoever he sheweth me will tell thee and he go to an high place and god met balaam and he say unto him have prepared seven altar and have offer upon every altar bullock and ram and the lord put word in balaam mouth and say return unto balak and thus thou shalt speak and he return unto him and lo he stood by his burnt sacrifice he and all the prince of moab and he take up his parable and say balak the king of moab hath brought me from aram out of the mountain of the east say come curse me jacob and come defy israel how shall curse whom god hath not curse or how shall defy whom the lord

of the fourth part of israel let me die the death of the righteous and let my last end be like his and balak say unto balaam what hast thou do unto me take thee to curse mine enemy and behold thou hast bless them altogether and he answer and say must not take heed to speak that which the lord hath put in my mouth and balak say unto him come pray thee with me unto another place from whence thou mayest see them thou shalt see but the utmost part of them and shalt not see them all and curse me them from thence and he brought him into the field of zophim to the top of pisgah and built seven altar and offer bullock and ram on every altar and he say unto balak stand here by thy burnt offering while meet the lord yonder and the lord met balaam and put word in his mouth and say go again unto balak and say thus and when he come to him behold he stood by his burnt offering and the prince of moab with him and balak say unto him what hath the lord spoken and he take up his parable and say

lord speaketh that must do and balak say unto balaam come pray thee will bring thee unto another place peradventure it will please god that thou mayest curse me them from thence and balak brought balaam unto the top of peor that looketh toward jeshimon and balaam say unto balak build me here seven altar and prepare me here seven bullock and seven ram and balak do a balaam have say and offer bullock and ram on every altar and when balaam saw that it pleased the lord to bless israel he go not a at other time to seek for enchantment but he set his face toward the wilderness and balaam lift up his eye and he saw israel abide in his tent accord to their tribe and the spirit of god come upon him and he take up his parable and say balaam the son of beor hath say and the man whose eye be open hath say he hath say which heard the word of god which saw the vision of the almighty fall into trance but have his eye open how goodly be thy tent jacob and thy tabernacle israel a the valley be

break their bone and pierce them through with his arrow he couched he lay down a lion and a great lion who shall stir him up bless be he that blesseth thee and curse be he that curseth thee and balak anger be kindle against balaam and he smote his hand together and balak say unto balaam call thee to curse mine enemy and behold thou hast altogether bless them these three time therefore now flee thou to thy place thought to promote thee unto great honour but lo the lord hath kept thee back from honour and balaam say unto balak spake not also to thy messenger which thou sentest unto me say if balak would give me his house full of silver and gold cannot go beyond the commandment of the lord to do either good or bad of mine own mind but what the lord saith that will speak and now behold go unto my people come therefore and will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter day and he take up his parable and say balaam the son of beor hath say and the man whose eye

wilderness by the way a they come forth out of egypt them they have not circumcise for the child of israel walk forty year in the wilderness till all the people that be men of war which come out of

before them but the rereward come after the ark of the lord the priest go on and blowing with the trumpet and the second day they compass the city once and return into the camp so they do six day and it come to pas on the seventh day that they rise early about the dawn of the day and compass the city after the same manner seven time only on that day they compass the city seven time and it come to pas at the seventh time when the priest blew with the trumpet joshua say unto the people shout for the lord hath give you the city and the city shall be accurse even it and all that be therein to the lord only rahab the harlot shall live she and all that be with her in the house because she hid the messenger that we sent and ye in any wise keep yourselves from the accurse thing l ye make yourselves accurse when ye take of the accurse thing and make the camp of israel curse and trouble it but all the silver and gold and vessel of brass and iron be consecrate unto the lord they shall come into the treasury of the lord so the people shout when the priest blew with the trumpet and it come to pas when the people heard the sound of the trumpet and the people shout with great shout that the wall fell down flat so that the people go up into the city every man straight before him and they take the city and they utterly destroyed all that be in the city both man and woman young and old and ox and sheep and as with the edge of the sword but joshua have say unto the two men that have spy out the country go into the harlot house and bring out thence the woman and all that she hath a ye sware unto her and the young men that be spy go in and brought out rahab and her father and her mother and her brother and all that she have and they brought out all her kindred and left them without the camp of israel and they burnt the city with fire and all that be therein only the silver and the gold and the vessel of brass and of iron they put into the treasury of the house of the lord and joshua save rahab the harlot alive and her father household and all that she have and she dwelleth in israel even unto this day because she hid the messenger which joshua sent to spy out jericho and joshua adjure them at that time say curse be the man before the lord that riseth up and buildeth this city jericho he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn and in his young son shall he set up the gate of it so the lord be with joshua and his fame be noise throughout all the country but the child of israel commit trespass in the accurse thing for achan the son of carmi the son of zabdi the son of zerah of the tribe of judah take of the accurse thing and the anger of the lord be kindle against the child of israel and joshua sent men from jericho to ai which be beside bethaven on the east of bethel and spake unto them say go up and view the country and the men go up and view ai and they return to joshua and say unto him let not all the people go up but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite ai and make not all the people to labour thither for they be but few so there go up thither of the people about three thousand men and they flee before the men of ai and the men of ai smote of them about thirty and six men for they chase them from before the gate even unto shebarim and smote them in the go down wherefore the heart of the people melt and become a water and joshua rent his clothes and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the lord until the eventide he and the elder of israel and put dust upon their head and joshua say ala lord god wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over jordan to deliver u into the hand of the amorites to destroy u would to god we have be content and dwelt on the other side jordan lord what shall say when israel turneth their back before their enemy for the canaanite and all the inhabitant of the land shall hear of it and shall environ u round and cut off our name from the earth and what wilt thou do unto thy great name and the lord say unto joshua get thee up wherefore li thou thus upon thy face israel hath sin and they have also transgress my covenant which command them for they have even take of the accurse thing and have also steal and dissemble also and they have put it even among their own stuff therefore the child of israel could not stand before their enemy but turn their back before their enemy because they be accurse neither will be with you any more except ye destroy the accurse from among you up sanctify the people and say sanctify yourselves against to morrow for thus saith the lord god of israel there be an accurse thing in the midst of thee israel thou canst not stand before thine enemy until ye take away the accurse thing from among you in the morning therefore ye shall be brought accord to your tribe and it shall be that the tribe which the lord taketh shall come accord to the family thereof and the family which the lord shall take shall come by household and the household which the lord shall take shall come man by man and it shall be that he that be take with the accurse thing shall be burnt with fire he and all that he hath because he hath transgress the covenant of the lord and because he hath wrought folly in israel so joshua rise up early in the morning and brought israel by their tribe and the tribe of judah be take and he brought the family of judah and he take the family of the zarhites and he brought the family of the zarhites man by man and zabdi be take and he brought his household man by man and achan the son of carmi the son of zabdi the son of zerah of the tribe of judah be take and joshua say unto achan my son give pray thee glory to the lord god of israel and make confession unto him and tell me now what thou hast do hide it not from me and achan answer joshua and say indeed have sin against the lord god of israel and thus and thus have do when saw among the spoil goodly babylonish garment and two hundred shekel of silver and wedge of gold of fifty shekel weight then covet them and take them and behold they be hid in the earth in the midst of my tent and the silver under it so joshua sent messenger and they ran unto the tent and behold it be hid in his tent and the silver under it and they take them out of the midst of the tent and brought them unto joshua and unto all the child of israel and laid them out before the lord and joshua and all israel with him take achan the son of zerah and the silver and the garment and the wedge of gold and his son and his daughter and his ox and his ass and his sheep and his tent and all that he have and they brought them unto the valley of achor and joshua say why hast thou troubled u the lord shall trouble thee this day and all israel stone him with stone and burn them with fire after they have stone them with stone and they raise over him great heap of stone unto this day so the lord turn from the fierceness of his anger wherefore the name of that place be call the valley of achor unto this day and the lord say unto joshua fear not neither be thou dismayed take all the people of war with thee and arise go up to ai see have give into thy hand the king of ai and his people and his city and his land and thou shalt do to ai and her king a thou didst unto jericho and her king only the spoil thereof and the cattle thereof shall ye take for prey unto yourselves lay thee an ambush for the city behind it so joshua arose and all the people of war to go up against ai and joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour and sent them away by night and he command them say behold ye shall lie in wait against the city even behind the city go not very far from the city but be ye all ready and and all the people that be with me will approach unto the city and it shall come to pas when they come out against u a at the first that we will flee before them for they will come out after u till we have drawn them from the city for they will say they flee before u a at the first therefore we will flee before them then ye shall rise up from the ambush and seize upon the city for the lord your god will deliver it into your hand and it shall be when ye have take the city that ye shall set the city on fire accord to the commandment of the lord shall ye do see have command you joshua therefore sent them forth and they go to lie in ambush and abode between bethel and ai on the west side of ai but joshua lodge that night among the people and joshua rise up early in the morning and numbered the people and go up he and the elder of israel before the people to ai and all the people even the people of war that be with him go up and drew nigh and come before the city and pitch on the north side of ai now there be valley between them and ai and he take about five thousand men and set them to lie in ambush between bethel and ai on the west side of the city and when they have set the people even all the host that be on the north of the city and their liers in wait on the west of the city joshua go that night into the midst of the valley and it come to pas when the king of ai saw it that they hasted and rise up early and the men of the city go out against israel to battle he and all his people at time appoint before the plain but he wist not that there be liers in ambush against him behind the city and joshua and all israel make a if they be beaten before them and flee by the way of the wilderness and all the people that be in ai be call together to pursue after them and they pursue after joshua and be drawn away from the city and there be not man left in ai or bethel that go not out after israel and they left the city open and pursue after israel and the lord say unto joshua stretch out the spear that be in thy hand toward ai for will give it into thine hand and joshua stretch out the spear that he have in his hand toward the city and the ambush arose quickly out of their place and they ran a soon a he have stretch out his hand and they enter into the city and take it and hasted and set the city on fire and when the men of ai look behind them they saw and behold the smoke of the city ascend up to heaven and they have no power to flee this way or that way and the people that flee to the wilderness turn back upon the pursuer and when joshua and all israel saw that the ambush have take the city and that the smoke of the city ascend then they turn again and slew the men of ai and the other issue out of the city against them so they be in the midst of israel some on this side and some on that side and they smote them so that they let none of them remain or escape and the king of ai they take alive and brought him to joshua and it come to pas when israel have make an end of slay all the inhabitant of ai in the field in the wilderness wherein they chase them and when they be all fall on the edge of the sword until they be consume that all the israelite return unto ai and smote it with the edge of the sword and so it be that all that fell that day both of men and woman be twelve thousand even all the men of ai for joshua drew not his hand back wherewith he stretch out the spear until he have utterly destroyed all the inhabitant of ai only the cattle and the spoil of that city israel take for prey unto themselves accord unto the word of the lord which he command joshua and joshua burnt ai and make it an heap for ever even desolation unto this day and the king of ai he hang on tree until eventide and a soon a the sun be down joshua command that they should take his carcase down from the tree and cast it at the enter of the gate of the city and raise thereon great heap of stone that remaineth unto this day then joshua built an altar unto the lord god of israel in mount ebal a moses the servant of the lord command the child of israel a it be write in the book of the law of moses an altar of whole stone over which no man hath lift up any iron and they offer thereon burnt offering unto the lord and sacrifice peace offering and he write there upon the stone copy of the law of moses which he write in the presence of the child of israel and all israel and their elder and officer and their judge stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priest the levite which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord a well the stranger a he that be born among them half of them over against mount gerizim and half of them over against mount ebal a moses the servant of the lord have command before that they should bless the people of israel and afterward he read all the word of the law the blessing and cursings accord to all that be write in the book of the law there be not word of all that moses command which joshua read not before all the congregation of israel with the woman and the little one and the stranger that be conversant among them and it come to pas when all the king which be on this side jordan in the hill and in the valley and in all the coast of the great sea over against lebanon the hittite and the amorite the canaanite the perizzite the hivite and the jebusite heard thereof that they gather themselves together to

and take old sack upon their ass and wine bottle old and rent and bound up and old shoe and clout upon their foot and old garment upon them and all the bread of their provision be dry and mouldy and they go to joshua unto the camp at gilgal and say unto him and to the men of israel we be come from far country now therefore make ye league with u and the men of israel say unto the hivites peradventure ye dwell among u and how shall we make league with you and they say unto joshua we be thy servant and joshua say unto them who be ye and from whence come ye and they say unto him from very far country thy servant be come because of the name of the lord thy god for we have heard the fame of him and all that he do in egypt and all that he do to the two king of the amorites that be beyond jordan to sihon king of heshbon and to og king of bashan which be at ashtaroth wherefore our elder and all the inhabitant of our country spake to u say take victual with you for the journey and

behold it be dry and it be mouldy and these bottle of wine which we fill be new and behold they be rent and these our garment and our shoe be become old by reason of the very long journey and the men take of their victual and ask not counsel at the mouth of the lord and joshua make peace with them and make league with them to let them live and the prince of the congregation sware unto them and it come to pas at the end of three day after they have make league with them that they heard that they be their neighbour and that they dwelt among them and the child of israel journeyed and come unto their city on the third day now their city be gibeon and chephirah and beeroth and kirjathjearim and the child of israel smote them not because the prince of the congregation have sworn unto them by the lord god of israel and all the congregation murmur against the prince but all the prince say unto all the congregation we have sworn unto them by the lord god of israel now therefore we may not touch them this we will do to them we will even let them live l wrath be upon u because of the oath which we sware unto them and the prince say unto them let them live but let them be hewer of wood and drawer of water unto all the congregation a the prince have promise them and joshua call for them and he spake unto them say wherefore have ye beguile u say we be very far from you when ye dwell among u now therefore ye be curse and there shall none of you be freed from be bondman and hewer of wood and drawer of water for the house of my god and they answer joshua and say because it be certainly told thy servant how that the lord thy god command his servant moses to give you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitant of the land from before you therefore we be sore afraid of our life because of you and have do this thing and now behold we be in thine hand a it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto u do and so do he unto them and deliver them out of the hand of the child of israel that they slew them not and joshua make them that day hewer of wood and drawer of water for the congregation and for the altar of the lord even unto this day in the place which he should choose now it come to pas when adonizedec king of jerusalem have heard how joshua have take ai and have utterly destroyed it a he have do to jericho and her king so he have do to ai and her king and how the inhabitant of gibeon have make peace with israel and be among them that they fear greatly because gibeon be great city a one of the royal city and because it be great than ai and all the men thereof be mighty wherefore adonizedec king of jerusalem sent unto hoham king of hebron and unto piram king of jarmuth and unto japhia king of lachish and unto debir king of eglon say come up unto me and help me that we may smite gibeon for it hath make peace with joshua and with the child of israel therefore the five king of the amorites the king of jerusalem the king of hebron the king of

and have go and serve other god and bow yourselves to them then shall the anger of the lord be kindle against you and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath give unto you and joshua gather all the tribe of israel to shechem and call for the elder of israel and for their head and for their judge and for their officer and they present themselves before god and joshua say unto all the people thus saith the lord god of israel your father dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time even terah the father of abraham and the father of nachor and they serve other god and take your father abraham from the other side of the flood and lead him throughout all the land of canaan and multiply his seed and give him isaac and give unto isaac jacob and esau and give unto esau mount seir to posse it but jacob and his child go down into egypt sent moses also and aaron and plague egypt accord to that which do among them and afterward brought you out and brought your father out of egypt and ye come unto the sea and the egyptian pursue after your father with chariot and horseman unto the red sea and when they cry unto the lord he put darkness between you and the egyptian and brought the sea upon them and cover them and your eye have see what have do in egypt and ye dwelt in the wilderness long season and brought you into the land of the amorites which dwelt on the other side jordan and they fought with you and give them into your hand that ye might posse their land and destroyed them from before you then balak the son of zippor king of moab arose and war against israel and sent and call balaam the son of beor to curse you but would not hearken unto balaam therefore he bless you still so deliver you out of his hand and you go over jordan and come unto jericho and the men of jericho fought against you the amorites and the perizzites and the canaanite and the hittite and the girgashites the hivites and the jebusites and deliver them into your hand and sent the hornet before you which drave them out from before you even the two king of the amorites but not with thy sword nor with thy bow and have give you land for which ye do not labour and city which ye built not and ye dwell in them of the vineyard and oliveyards which ye plant not do ye eat now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the god which your father serve on the other side of the flood and in egypt and serve ye the lord and if it seem evil unto you to serve the lord choose you this day whom ye will serve whether the god which your father serve that be on the other side of the flood or the god of the amorites in whose land ye dwell but a for me and my house we will serve the lord and the people answer and say god forbid that we should forsake the lord to serve other god for the lord our god he it be that brought u up and our father out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage and which do those great sign in our sight and preserve u in all the way wherein we go and among all the people through whom we pass and the lord drave out from before u all the people even the amorites which dwelt in the land therefore will we also serve the lord for he be our god and joshua say unto the people ye cannot serve the lord for he be an holy god he be jealous god he will not forgive your transgression nor your sin if ye forsake the lord and serve strange god then he will turn and do you hurt and consume you after that he hath do you good and the people say unto joshua nay but we will serve the lord and joshua say unto the people ye be witness against yourselves that ye have chosen you the lord to serve him and they say we be witness now therefore put away say he the strange god which be among you and incline your heart unto the lord god of israel and the people say unto joshua the lord our god will we serve and his voice will we obey so joshua make covenant with the people that day and set them statute and an ordinance in shechem and joshua write these word in the book of the law of god and take great stone and set it up there under an oak that be by the sanctuary of the lord and joshua say unto all the people behold this stone shall be witness unto u for it hath heard all the word of the lord which he spake unto u it shall be therefore witness unto you l ye deny your god so joshua let the people depart every man unto his inheritance and it come to pas after these thing that joshua the son of nun the servant of the lord die be an hundred and ten year old and they bury him in the border of his inheritance in timnathserah which be in mount ephraim on the north side of the hill of gaash and israel serve the lord all the day of joshua and all the day of the elder that overlived joshua and which have know all the work of the lord that he have do for israel and the bone of joseph which the child of israel brought up out of egypt bury they in shechem in parcel of ground which jacob bought of the son of hamor the father of shechem for an hundred piece of silver and it become the inheritance of the child of joseph and eleazar the son of aaron die and they bury him in hill that pertain to phinehas his son which be give him in mount ephraim book judge now after the death of joshua it come to pas that the child of israel ask the lord say who shall go up for u against the canaanite first to fight against them and the lord say judah shall go up behold have deliver the land into his hand and judah say unto simeon his brother come up with me into my lot that we may fight against the canaanite and likewise will go with thee into thy lot so simeon go with him and judah go up and the lord deliver the canaanite and the perizzites into their hand and they slew of them in bezek ten thousand men and they found adonibezek in bezek and they fought against him and they slew the canaanite and the perizzites but adonibezek flee and they pursue after him and caught him and cut off his thumb and his great toe and adonibezek say threescore and ten king have their thumb and their great toe cut off gather their meat under my table a have do so god hath requite me and they brought him to jerusalem and there he die now the child of judah have fought against jerusalem and have take it and smitten it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire and afterward the child of judah go down to fight against the canaanite that dwelt in the mountain and in the south and in the valley and judah go against the canaanite that dwelt in hebron now the name of hebron before be kirjatharba and they slew sheshai and ahiman and talmai and from thence he go against the inhabitant of debir and the name of debir before be kirjathsepher and caleb say he that smiteth kirjathsepher and taketh it to him will give achsah my daughter to wife and othniel the son of kenaz caleb young brother take it and he give him achsah his daughter to wife and it come to pas when she come to him that she move him to ask of her father field and she light from off her as and caleb say unto her what wilt thou and she say unto him give me blessing for thou hast give me south land give me also spring of water and caleb give her the upper spring and the nether spring and the child of the kenite moses father in law go up out of the city of palm tree with the child of judah into the wilderness of judah which lieth in the south of arad and they go and dwelt among the people and judah go with simeon his brother and they slew the canaanite that inhabit zephath and utterly destroyed it and the name of the city be call hormah also judah take gaza with the coast thereof and askelon with the coast thereof and ekron with the coast thereof and the lord be with judah and he drave out the inhabitant of the mountain but could not drive out the inhabitant of the valley because they have chariot of iron and they give hebron unto caleb a moses say and he expel thence the three son of anak and the child of benjamin do not drive out the jebusites that inhabit jerusalem but the jebusites dwell with the child of benjamin in jerusalem unto this day and the house of joseph they also go up against bethel and the lord be with them and the house of joseph sent to descry bethel now the name of the city before be luz and the spy saw man come forth out of the city and they say unto him shew u we pray thee the entrance into the city and we will shew thee mercy and when he shew them the entrance into the city they smote the city with the edge of the sword but they let go the man and all his family and the man go into the land of the hittite and built city and call the name thereof luz which be the name thereof unto this day neither do manasseh drive out the inhabitant of bethshean and her town nor taanach and her town nor the inhabitant of dor and her town nor the inhabitant of ibleam and her town nor the inhabitant of megiddo and her town but the canaanite would dwell in that land and it come to pas when israel be strong that they put the canaanite to tribute and do not utterly drive them out neither do ephraim drive out the canaanite that dwelt in gezer but the canaanite dwelt in gezer among them neither do zebulun drive out the inhabitant of kitron nor the inhabitant of nahalol but the canaanite dwelt among them and become tributary neither do asher drive out the inhabitant of accho nor the inhabitant of zidon nor of ahlab nor of achzib nor of helbah nor of aphik nor of rehob but the asherites dwelt among the canaanite the inhabitant of the land for they do not drive them out neither do naphtali drive out the inhabitant of bethshemesh nor the inhabitant of bethanath but he dwelt among the canaanite the inhabitant of the land nevertheless the inhabitant of bethshemesh and of bethanath become tributary unto them and the amorites force the child of dan into the mountain for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley but the amorites would dwell in mount here in aijalon and in shaalbim yet the hand of the house of joseph prevail so that they become tributary and the coast of the amorites be from the go up to akrabbim from the rock and upward and an angel of the lord come up from gilgal to bochim and say make you to go up out of egypt and have brought you unto the land which sware unto your father and say will never break my covenant with you and ye shall make no league with the inhabitant of this land ye shall throw down their altar but ye have not obeyed my voice why have ye do this wherefore also say will not drive them out from before you but they shall be a thorn in your side and their god shall be snare unto you and it come to pas when the angel of the lord spake these word unto all the child of israel that the people lift up their voice and wept and they call the name of that place bochim and they sacrifice there unto the lord and when joshua have let the people go the child of israel go every man unto his inheritance to posse the land and the people serve the lord all the day of joshua and all the day of the elder that outlive joshua who have see all the great work of the lord that he do for israel and joshua the son of nun the servant of the lord die be an hundred and ten year old and they bury him in the border of his inheritance in timnathheres in the mount of ephraim on the north side of the hill gaash and also all that generation be gather unto their father and there arose another generation after them which knew not the lord nor yet the work which he have do for israel and the child of israel do evil in the sight of the lord and serve baalim and they forsook the lord god of their father which brought them out of the land of egypt and follow other god of the god of the people that be round about them and bow themselves unto them and provoke the lord to anger and they forsook the lord and serve baal and ashtaroth and the anger of the lord be hot against israel and he deliver them into the hand of spoiler that spoil them and he sell them into the hand of their enemy round about so that they could not any longer stand before their enemy whithersoever they go out the hand of the lord be against them for evil a the lord have say and a the lord have sworn unto them and they be greatly distressed nevertheless the lord raise up judge which deliver them out of the hand of those that spoil them and yet they would not hearken unto their judge but they go whore after other god and bow themselves unto them they turn quickly out of the way which their father walk in obey the commandment of the lord but they do not so and when the lord raise them up judge then the lord be with the judge and deliver them out of the hand of their enemy all the day of the judge for it repent the lord because of their groanings by reason of them that oppress them and vexed them and it come to pas when the judge be dead that they return and corrupt themselves more than their father in follow other god to serve them and to bow down unto them they cease not from their own doings nor from their stubborn way and the anger of the lord be hot against israel and he say because that this people hath transgress my covenant which command their father and have not hearken unto my voice also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nation which joshua left when he die that through them may prove israel whether they will keep the way of the lord to walk therein a their father do keep it or not therefore the lord left those nation without drive them out hastily neither deliver he them into the hand of joshua now these be the nation which the lord left to prove israel by them even a many of israel a have not know all the war of canaan only that the generation of the child of israel might know to teach them war at the least such a before knew nothing thereof namely five lord of the philistine and all the canaanite and the sidonians and the hivites that dwelt in mount lebanon from mount baalhermon unto the enter in of hamath and they be to prove israel by them to know whether they would hearken unto the commandment of the lord which he command their father by the hand of moses and the child of israel dwelt among the canaanite hittite and amorites and perizzites and hivites and jebusites and they take their daughter to be their wife and give their daughter to their son and serve their god and the child of israel do evil in the sight of the lord and forgat the lord their god and serve baalim and the grove therefore the anger of the lord be hot against israel and he sell them into the hand of chushanrishathaim king of mesopotamia and the child of israel serve chushanrishathaim eight year and when the child of israel cry unto the lord the lord raise up deliverer to the child of israel who deliver them even othniel the son of kenaz caleb young brother and the spirit of the lord come upon him and he judged israel and go out to war and the lord deliver chushanrishathaim king of mesopotamia into his hand and his hand prevail against chushanrishathaim and the land have rest forty year and othniel the son of kenaz die and the child of israel do evil again in the sight of the lord and the lord strengthen eglon the king of moab against israel because they have do evil in the sight of the lord and he gather unto him the child of ammon and amalek and go and smote israel and possess the city of palm tree so the child of israel serve eglon the king of moab eighteen year but when the child of israel cry unto the lord the lord raise them up deliverer ehud the son of gera benjamite man lefthanded and by him the child of israel sent present unto eglon the king of moab but ehud make him dagger which have two edge of cubit length and he do gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh and he brought the present unto eglon king of moab and eglon be very fat man and when he have make an end to offer the present he sent away the people that bare the present but he himself turn again from the quarry that be by gilgal and say have secret errand unto thee king who say keep silence and all that stood by him go out from him and ehud come unto him and he be sit in summer parlour which he have for himself alone and ehud say have message from god unto thee and he arose out of his seat and ehud put forth his left hand and take the dagger from his right thigh and thrust it into his belly and the haft also go in after the blade and the fat close upon the blade so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly and the dirt come out then ehud go forth through the porch and shut the door of the parlour upon him and lock them when he be go out his servant come and when they saw that behold the door of the parlour be lock they say surely he covereth his foot in his summer chamber and they tarry till they be ashamed and behold he open not the door of the parlour therefore they take key and open them and behold their lord be fall down dead on the earth and ehud escape while they tarry and pass beyond the quarry and escape unto seirath and it come to pas when he be come that he blew trumpet in the mountain of ephraim and the child of israel go down with him from the mount and he before them and he say unto them follow after me for the lord hath deliver your enemy the moabites into your hand and they go down after him and take the ford of jordan toward moab and suffer not man to pas over and they slew of moab at that time about ten thousand men all lusty and all men of valour and there escape not man so moab be subdue that day under the hand of israel and the land have rest fourscore year and after him be shamgar the son of anath which slew of the philistine six hundred men with an ox goad and he also deliver israel and the child of israel again do evil in the sight of the lord when ehud be dead and the lord sell them into the hand of jabin king of canaan that reign in hazor the captain of whose host be sisera which dwelt in harosheth of the gentile and the child of israel cry unto the lord for he have nine hundred chariot of iron and twenty year he mightily oppress the child of israel and deborah prophetess the wife of lapidoth she judged israel at that time and she dwelt under the palm tree of deborah between ramah and bethel in mount ephraim and the child of israel come up to her for judgment and she sent and call barak the son of abinoam out of kedeshnaphtali and say unto him hath not the lord god of israel command say go and draw toward mount tabor and take with thee ten thousand men of the child of naphtali and of the child of zebulun and will draw unto thee to the river kishon sisera the captain of jabin army with his chariot and his multitude and will deliver him into thine hand and barak say unto her if thou wilt go with me then will go but if thou wilt not go with me then will not go and she say will surely go with thee notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour for the lord shall sell sisera into the hand of woman and deborah arose and go with barak to kedesh and barak call zebulun and naphtali to kedesh and he go up with ten thousand men at his foot and deborah go up with him now heber the kenite which be of the child of hobab the father in law of moses have sever himself from the kenites and pitch his tent unto the

people that be with him from harosheth of the gentile unto the river of kishon and deborah say unto barak up for this be the day in which the lord hath deliver sisera into thine hand be not the lord go out before thee so barak go down from mount tabor and ten thousand men after him and the lord discomfit sisera and all his chariot and all his host with the edge of the sword before barak so that sisera light down off his chariot and flee away on his foot but barak pursue after the chariot and after the host unto harosheth of the gentile and all the host of sisera fell upon the edge of the

that love him be a the sun when he goeth forth in his might and the land have rest forty year and the child of israel do evil in the sight of the lord and the lord deliver them into the hand of midian seven year and the hand of midian prevail against israel and because of the midianites the child of israel make them the den which be in the mountain and cave and strong hold and so it be when israel have sown that the midianites come up and the amalekites and the child of the east even they come up against them and they encamp against them and destroyed the increase of the earth till thou come unto gaza and left no sustenance for israel neither sheep nor ox nor as for they come up with their cattle and their tent and they come a grasshopper for multitude for both they and their camel be without number and they enter into the land to destroy it and israel be greatly impoverish because of the midianites and the child of israel cry unto the lord and it come to pas when the child of israel cry unto the lord because of the midianites that the lord sent prophet unto the child of israel which say unto them thus saith the lord god of israel brought you up from egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage and deliver you out of the hand of the egyptian and out of the hand of all that oppress you and drave them out from before you and give you their land and say unto you be the lord your god fear not the god of the amorites in whose land ye dwell but ye have not obeyed my voice and there come an angel of the lord and sat under an oak which be in ophrah that pertain unto joash the abiezrite and his son gideon thresh wheat by the winepress to hide it from the midianites and the angel of the lord appear unto him and say unto him the lord be with thee thou mighty man of valour and gideon say unto him oh my lord if the lord be with u why then be all this befallen u and where be all his miracle which our father told u of say do not the lord bring u up from egypt but now the lord hath forsaken u and deliver u into the hand of the midianites and the lord look upon him and say go in this thy might and thou shalt save israel from the hand of the midianites have not sent thee and he say unto him oh my lord wherewith shall save israel behold my family be poor in manasseh and be the least in my father house and the lord say unto him surely will be with thee and thou shalt smite the midianites a one man and he say unto him if now have found grace in thy sight then shew me sign that thou talkest with me depart not hence pray thee until come unto thee and bring forth my present and set it before thee and he say will tarry until thou come again and gideon go in and make ready kid and unleavened cake of an ephah of flour the flesh he put in basket and he put the broth in pot and brought it out unto him under the oak and present it and the angel of god say unto him take the flesh and the unleavened cake and lay them upon this rock and pour out the broth and he do so then the angel of the lord put forth the end of the staff that be in his hand and touch the flesh and the unleavened cake and there rise up fire out of the rock and consume the flesh and the unleavened cake then the angel of the lord depart out of his sight and when gideon perceive that he be an angel of the lord gideon say ala lord god for because have see an angel of the lord face to face and the lord say unto him peace be unto thee fear not thou shalt not die then gideon built an altar there unto the lord and call it jehovahshalom unto this day it be yet in ophrah of the abiezrites and it come to pas the same night that the lord say unto him take thy father young bullock even the second bullock of seven year old and throw down the altar of baal that thy father hath and cut down the grove that be by it and build an altar unto the lord thy god upon the top of this rock in the order place and take the second bullock and offer burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down then gideon take ten men of his servant and do a the lord have say unto him and so it be because he fear his father household and the men of the city that he could not do it by day that he do it by night and when the men of the city arose early in the morning behold the altar of baal be cast down and the grove be cut down that be by it and the second bullock be offer upon the altar that be built and they say one to another who hath do this thing and when they enquire and ask they say gideon the son of joash hath do this thing then the men of the city say unto joash bring out thy son that he may die because he hath cast down the altar of baal and because he hath cut down the grove that be by it and joash say unto all that stood against him will ye plead for baal will ye save him he that will plead for him let him be put to death whilst it be yet morning if he be god let him plead for himself because one hath cast down his altar therefore on that day he call him jerubbaal say let baal plead against him because he hath thrown down his altar then all the midianites and the amalekites and the child of the east be gather together and go over and pitch in the valley of jezreel but the spirit of the lord come upon gideon and he blew trumpet and abiezer be gather after him and he sent messenger throughout all manasseh who also be gather after him and he sent messenger unto asher and unto zebulun and unto naphtali and they come up to meet them and gideon say unto god if thou wilt save israel by mine hand a thou hast say behold will put fleece of wool in the floor and if the dew be on the fleece only and it be dry upon all the earth beside then shall know that thou wilt save israel by mine hand a thou hast say and it be so for he rise up early on the morrow and thrust the fleece together and wring the dew out of the fleece bowl full of water and gideon say unto god let not thine anger be hot against me and will speak but this once let me prove pray thee but this once with the fleece let it now be dry only upon the fleece and upon all the ground let there be dew and god do so that night for it be dry upon the fleece only and there be dew on all the ground then jerubbaal who be gideon and all the people that be with him rise up early and pitch beside the well of harod so that the host of the midianites be on the north side of them by the hill of moreh in the valley and the lord say unto gideon the people that be with thee be too many for me to give the midianites into their hand l israel vaunt themselves against me say mine own hand hath save me now therefore go to proclaim in the ear of the people say whosoever be fearful and afraid let him return and depart early from mount gilead and there return of the people twenty and two thousand and there remain ten thousand and the lord say unto gideon the people be yet too many bring them down unto the water and will try them for thee there and it shall be that of whom say unto thee this shall go with thee the same shall go with thee and of whomsoever say unto thee this shall not go with thee the same shall not go so he brought down the people unto the water and the lord say unto gideon every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue a dog lappeth him shalt thou set by himself likewise every one that boweth down upon his knee to drink and the number of them that lap put their hand to their mouth be three hundred men but all the rest of the people bow down upon their knee to drink water and the lord say unto gideon by the three hundred men that lap will save you and deliver the midianites into thine hand and let all the other people go every man unto his place so the people take victual in their hand and their trumpet and he sent all the rest of israel every man unto his tent and retain those three hundred men and the host of midian be beneath him in the valley and it come to pas the same night that the lord say unto him arise get thee down unto the host for have deliver it into thine hand but if thou fear to go down go thou with phurah thy servant down to the host and thou shalt hear what they say and afterward shall thine hand be strengthen to go down unto the host then go he down with phurah his servant unto the outside of the arm men that be in the host and the midianites and the amalekites and all the child of the east lay along in the valley like grasshopper for multitude and their camel be without number a the sand by the sea side for multitude and when gideon be come behold there be man that told dream unto his fellow and say behold dream dream and lo cake of barley bread tumble into the host of midian and come unto tent and smote it that it fell and overturn it that the tent lay along and his fellow answer and say this be nothing else save the sword of gideon the son of joash man of israel for into his hand hath god deliver midian and all the host and it be so when gideon heard the tell of the dream and the interpretation thereof that he worship and return into the host of israel and say arise for the lord hath deliver into your hand the host of midian and he divide the three hundred men into three company and he put trumpet in every man hand with empty pitcher and lamp within the pitcher and he say unto them look on me and do likewise and behold when come to the outside of the camp it shall be that a do so shall ye do when blow with trumpet and all that be with me then blow ye the trumpet also on every side of all the camp and say the sword of the lord and of

pitcher that be in their hand and the three company blew the trumpet and brake the pitcher and held the lamp in their left hand and the trumpet in their right hand to blow withal and they cry the

against his fellow even throughout all the host and the host flee to bethshittah in zererath and to the border of abelmeholah unto tabbath and the men of israel gather themselves together out of naphtali and out of asher and out of all manasseh and pursue after the midianites and gideon sent messenger throughout all mount ephraim say come down against the midianites and take before them the water unto bethbarah and jordan then all the men of ephraim gather themselves together and take the water unto bethbarah and jordan and they take two prince of the midianites oreb and zeeb and they slew oreb upon the rock oreb and zeeb they slew at the winepress of zeeb and pursue midian and brought the head of oreb and zeeb to gideon on the other side jordan and the men of ephraim say unto him

the day of gideon and jerubbaal the son of joash go and dwelt in his own house and gideon have threescore and ten son of his body begotten for he have many wife and his concubine that be in shechem she also bare him son whose name he call abimelech and gideon the son of joash die in good old age and be bury in the sepulchre of joash his father in ophrah of the abiezrites and it come to pas a soon a gideon be dead that the child of israel turn again and go whore after baalim and make baalberith their god and the child of israel remember not the lord their god who have deliver them out of the hand of all their enemy on every side neither shew they kindness to the house of jerubbaal namely gideon accord to all the goodness which he have shew unto israel and abimelech the son of jerubbaal go to shechem unto his mother brother and commune with them and with all the family of the house of his mother father say speak pray you in the ear of all the men of shechem whether be well for you either that all the son of jerubbaal which be threescore and ten person reign over you or that one reign over you remember also that be your bone and your flesh and his mother brother spake of him in the ear of all the men of shechem all these word and their heart inclined to follow abimelech for they say he be our brother and they give him threescore and ten piece of silver out of the house of baalberith wherewith abimelech hire vain and light person which follow him and he go unto his father house at ophrah and slew his brother the son of jerubbaal be threescore and ten person upon one stone notwithstanding yet jotham the young son of jerubbaal be left for he hid himself and all the men of shechem gather together and all the house of millo and go and make abimelech king by the plain of the pillar that be in shechem and when they told it to jotham he go and stood in the top of mount gerizim and lift up his voice and cry and say unto them hearken unto me ye men of shechem

let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedar of lebanon now therefore if ye have do truly and sincerely in that ye have make abimelech king and if ye have dealt well with jerubbaal and his house and have do unto him accord to the deserve of his hand for my father fought for you and adventure his life far and deliver you out of the hand of midian and ye be risen up against my father house this day and have slain his son threescore and ten person upon one stone and have make abimelech the son of his maidservant king over the men of shechem because he be your brother if ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with jerubbaal and with his house this day then rejoice ye in abimelech and let him also rejoice in you but if not let fire come out from abimelech and devour the men of shechem and the house of millo and let fire come out from the men of shechem and from the house of millo and devour abimelech and jotham ran away and flee and go to beer and dwelt there for fear of abimelech his brother when abimelech have reign three year over israel then god sent an evil spirit between abimelech and the men of shechem and the men of shechem dealt treacherously with abimelech that the cruelty do to the threescore and ten son of jerubbaal might come and their blood be laid upon abimelech their brother which slew them and upon the men of shechem which aid him in the kill of his brother and the men of shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountain and they robbed all that come along that way by them and it be told abimelech and gaal the son of ebed come with his brother and go over to shechem and the men of shechem put their confidence in him and they go out into the field and gather their vineyard and trode the grape and make merry and go into the house of their god and do eat and drink and curse abimelech and gaal the son of ebed say who be abimelech and who be shechem that we should serve him be not he the son of jerubbaal and zebul his officer serve the men of hamor the father of shechem for why should we serve him and would to god this people be under my hand then would remove abimelech and he say to abimelech increase thine army and come out and when zebul the ruler of the city heard the word of gaal the son of ebed his anger be kindle and he sent messenger unto abimelech privily say behold gaal the son of ebed and his brother be come to shechem and behold they fortify the city against thee now therefore up by night thou and the people that be with thee and lie in wait in the field and it shall be that in the morning a soon a the sun be up thou shalt rise early and set upon the city and behold when he and the people that be with him come out against thee then mayest thou do to them a thou shalt find occasion and abimelech rise up and all the people that be with him by night and they laid wait against shechem in four company and gaal the son of ebed go out and stood in the enter of the gate of the city and abimelech rise up and the people that be with him from lie in wait and when gaal saw the people he say to zebul behold there come people down from the top of the mountain and zebul say unto him thou seest the shadow of the mountain a if they be men and gaal spake again and say see there come people down by the middle of the land and another company come along by the plain of meonenim then say zebul unto him where be now thy mouth wherewith thou saidst who be abimelech that we should serve him be not this the people that thou hast despise go out pray now and fight with them and gaal go out before the men of shechem and fought with abimelech and abimelech chase him and he flee before him and many be overthrown and wound even unto the enter of the gate and abimelech dwelt at arumah and zebul thrust out gaal and his brother that they should not dwell in shechem and it come to pas on the morrow that the people go out into the field and they told abimelech and he take the people and divide them into three company and laid wait in the field and look and behold the people be come forth out of the city and he rise up against them and smote them and abimelech and the company that be with him rush forward and stood in the enter of the gate of the city and the two other company ran upon all the people that be in the field and slew them and abimelech fought against the city all that day and he take the city and slew the people that be therein and beat down the city and sow it with salt and when all the men of the tower of shechem heard that they enter into an hold of the house of the god berith and it be told abimelech that all the men of the tower of shechem be gather together and abimelech gat him up to mount zalmon he and all the people that be with him and abimelech take an axe in his hand and cut down bough from the tree and take it and laid it on his shoulder and say unto the people that be with him what ye have see me do make haste and do a have do and all the people likewise cut down every man his bough and follow abimelech and put them to the hold and set the hold on fire upon them so that all the men of the tower of shechem die also about thousand men and woman then go abimelech to thebez and encamp against thebez and take it but there be strong tower within the city and thither flee all the men and woman and all they of the city and shut it to them and gat them up to the top of the tower and abimelech come unto the tower and fought against it and go hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire and certain woman cast piece of millstone upon abimelech head and all to brake his skull then he call hastily unto the young man his armourbearer and say unto him draw thy sword and slay me that men say not of me woman slew him and his young man thrust him through and he die and when the men of israel saw that abimelech be dead they depart every man unto his place thus god render the wickedness of abimelech which he do unto his father in slay his seventy brother and all the evil of the men of shechem do god render upon their head and upon them come the curse of jotham the son of jerubbaal and after abimelech there arose to defend israel tola the son of puah the son of dodo man of issachar and he dwelt in shamir in mount ephraim and he judged israel twenty and three year and die and be bury in shamir and after him arose jair gileadite and judged israel twenty and two year and he have thirty son that rode on thirty as colt and they have thirty city which be call havothjair unto this day which be in the land of gilead and jair die and be bury in camon and the child of israel do evil again in the sight of the lord and serve baalim and ashtaroth and the god of syria and the god of zidon and the god of moab and the god of the child of ammon and the god of the philistine and forsook the lord and serve not him and the anger of the lord be hot against israel and he sell them into the hand of the philistine and into the hand of the child of ammon and that year they vexed and oppress the child of israel eighteen year all the child of israel that be on the other side jordan in the land of the amorites which be in gilead moreover the child of ammon pass over jordan to fight also against judah and against benjamin and against the house of ephraim so that israel be sore distressed and the child of israel cry unto the lord say we have sin against thee both because we have forsaken our god and also serve baalim and the lord say unto the child of israel do not deliver you from the egyptian and from the amorites from the child of ammon and from the philistine the zidonians also and the amalekites and the maonites do oppress you and ye cry to me and deliver you out of their hand yet ye have forsaken me and serve other god wherefore will deliver you no more go and cry unto the god which ye have chosen let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation and the child of israel say unto the lord we have sin do thou unto u whatsoever seemeth good unto thee deliver u only we pray thee this day and they put away the strange god from among them and serve the lord and his soul be grieve for the misery of israel then the child of ammon be gather together and encamp in gilead and the child of israel assemble themselves together and encamp in mizpeh and the people and prince of gilead say one to another what man be he that will begin to fight against the child of ammon he shall be head over all the inhabitant of gilead now jephthah the gileadite be mighty man of valour and he be the son of an harlot and gilead begat jephthah and gilead wife bare him son and his wife son grow up and they thrust out jephthah and say unto him thou shalt not inherit in our father house for thou art the son of strange woman then jephthah flee from his brother and dwelt in the land of tob and there be gather vain men to jephthah and go out with him and it come to pas in process of time that the child of ammon make war against israel and it be so that when the child of ammon make war against israel the elder of gilead go to fetch jephthah out of the land of tob and they say unto jephthah come and be our captain that we may fight with the child of ammon and jephthah say unto the elder of gilead do not ye hate me and expel me out of my father house and why be ye come unto me now when ye be in distress and the elder of gilead say unto jephthah therefore we turn again to thee now that thou mayest go with u and fight against the child of ammon and be our head over all the inhabitant of gilead and jephthah say unto the elder of gilead if ye bring me home again to fight against the child of ammon and the lord deliver them before me shall be your head and the elder of gilead say unto jephthah the lord be witness between u if we do not so accord to thy word then jephthah go with the elder of gilead and the people make him head and captain over them and jephthah uttered all his word before the lord in mizpeh and jephthah sent messenger unto the king of the child of ammon say what hast thou to do with me that thou art come against me to fight in my land and the king of the child of ammon answer unto the messenger of jephthah because israel take away my land when they come up out of egypt from arnon even unto jabbok and unto jordan now therefore restore those land again peaceably and jephthah sent messenger again unto the king of the child of ammon and say unto him thus saith jephthah israel take not away the land of moab nor the land of the child of ammon but when israel come up from egypt and walk through the wilderness unto the red sea and come to kadesh then israel sent messenger unto the king of edom say let me pray thee pas through thy land but the king of edom would not hearken thereto and in like manner they sent unto the king of moab but he would not consent and israel abode in kadesh then they go along through the wilderness and compass the land of edom and the land of moab and come by the east side of the land of moab and pitch on the other side of arnon but come not within the border of moab for arnon be the border of moab and israel sent messenger unto sihon king of the amorites the king of heshbon and israel say unto him let u pas we pray thee through thy land into my place but sihon trust not israel to pas through his coast but sihon gather all his people together and pitch in jahaz and fought against israel and the lord god of israel deliver sihon and all his people into the hand of israel and they smote them so israel possess all the land of the amorites the inhabitant of that country and they possess all the coast of the amorites from arnon even unto jabbok and from the wilderness even unto jordan so now the lord god of israel hath dispossess the amorites from before his people israel and shouldest thou posse it wilt not thou posse that which chemosh thy god giveth thee to posse so whomsoever the lord our god shall drive out from before u them will we posse and now art thou any thing well than balak the son of zippor king of moab do he ever strive against israel or do he ever fight against them while israel dwelt in heshbon and her town and in aroer and her town and in all the city that be along by the coast of arnon three hundred year why therefore do ye not recover them within that time wherefore have not sin

gird with strength they that be full have hire out themselves for bread and they that be hungry cease so that the barren hath born seven and she that hath many child be waxed feeble the lord killeth and maketh alive he bringeth down to the grave and bringeth up the lord maketh poor and maketh rich he bringeth low and lifteth up he raiseth up the poor out of the dust and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill to set them among prince and to make them inherit the throne of glory for the pillar of the earth be the lord and he hath set the world upon them he will keep the foot of his saint and the wicked shall be silent in darkness for by strength shall no man prevail the adversary of the lord shall be broken to piece out of heaven shall he thunder upon them the lord shall judge the end of the earth and he shall give strength unto his king and exalt the horn of his anoint and elkanah go to ramah to his house and the child do minister unto the lord before eli the priest now the son of eli be son of belial they knew not the lord and the priest custom with the people be that when any man offer sacrifice the priest servant come while the flesh be in seethe with fleshhook of three teeth in his hand and he struck it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot all that the fleshhook brought up the priest take for himself so they do in shiloh unto all the israelite that come thither also before they burnt the fat the priest servant come and say to the man that sacrifice give flesh to roast for the priest for he will not have sodden flesh of thee but raw and if any man say unto him let them not fail to burn the fat presently and then take a much a thy soul desireth then he would answer him nay but thou shalt give it me now and if not will take it by force wherefore the sin of the young men be very great before the lord for men abhor the offering of the lord but samuel minister before the lord be child gird with linen ephod moreover his mother make him little coat and brought it to him from year to year when she come up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice and eli bless elkanah and his wife and say the lord give thee seed of this woman for the loan which be lent to the lord and they go unto their own home and the lord visit hannah so that she conceive and bare three son and two daughter and the child samuel grow before the lord now eli be very old and heard all that his son do unto all israel and how they lay with the woman that assemble at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and he say unto them why do ye such thing for hear of your evil dealing by all this people nay my son for it be no good report that hear ye make the lord people to transgress if one man sin against another the judge shall judge him but if man sin against the lord who shall intreat for him notwithstanding they hearken not unto the voice of their father because the lord would slay them and the child samuel grow on and be in favour both with the lord and also with men and there come man of god unto eli and say unto him thus saith the lord do plainly appear unto the house of thy father when they be in egypt in pharaoh house and do choose him out of all the tribe of israel to be my priest to offer upon mine altar to burn incense to wear an ephod before me and do give unto the house of thy father all the offering make by fire of the child of israel wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering which have command in my habitation and honourest thy son above me to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offering of israel my people wherefore the lord god of israel saith say indeed that thy house and the house of thy father should walk before me for ever but now the lord saith be it far from me for them that honour me will honour and they that despise me shall be lightly esteem behold the day come that will cut off thine arm and the arm of thy father house that there shall not be an old man in thine house and thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation in all the wealth which god shall give israel and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever and the man of thine whom shall not cut off from mine altar shall be to consume thine eye and to grieve thine heart and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age and this shall be sign unto thee that shall come upon thy two son on hophni and phinehas in one day they shall die both of them and will raise me up faithful priest that shall do accord to that which be in mine heart and in my mind and will build him sure house and he shall walk before mine anoint for ever and it shall come to pas that every one that be left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for piece of silver and morsel of bread and shall say put me pray thee into one of the priest office that may eat piece of bread and the child samuel minister unto the lord before eli and the word of the lord be precious in those day there be no open vision and it come to pas at that time when eli be laid down in his place and his eye begin to wax dim that he could not see and ere the lamp of god go out in the temple of the lord where the ark of god be and samuel be laid down to sleep that the lord call samuel and he answer here be and he ran unto eli and say here be for thou calledst me and he say call not lie down again and he go and lay down and the lord call yet again samuel and samuel arose and go to eli and say here be for thou didst call me and he answer call not my son lie down again now samuel do not yet know the lord neither be the word of the lord yet reveal unto him and the lord call samuel again the third time and he arose and go to eli and say here be for thou didst call me and eli perceive that the lord have call the child therefore eli say unto samuel go lie down and it shall be if he call thee that thou shalt say speak lord for thy servant heareth so samuel go and lay down in his place and the lord come and stood and call a at other time samuel samuel then samuel answer speak for thy servant heareth and the lord say to samuel behold will do thing in israel at which both the ear of every one that heareth it shall tingle in that day will perform against eli all thing which have spoken concern his house when begin will also make an end for have told him that will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth because his son make themselves vile and he restrain them not and therefore have sworn unto the house of eli that the iniquity of eli house shall not be purge with sacrifice nor offering for ever and samuel lay until the morning and open the door of the house of the lord and samuel fear to shew eli the vision then eli call samuel and say samuel my son and he answer here be and he say what be the thing that the lord hath say unto thee pray thee hide it not from me god do so to thee and more also if thou hide any thing from me of all the thing that he say unto thee and samuel told him every whit and hid nothing from him and he say it be the lord let him do what seemeth him good and samuel grow and the lord be with him and do let none of his word fall to the ground and all israel from dan even to beersheba knew that samuel be establish to be prophet of the lord and the lord appear again in shiloh for the lord reveal himself to samuel in shiloh by the word of the lord and the word of samuel come to all israel now israel go out against the philistine to battle and pitch beside ebenezer and the philistine pitch in aphek and the philistine put themselves in array against israel and when they join battle israel be smitten before the philistine and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men and when the people be come into the camp the elder of israel say wherefore hath the lord smitten u to day before the philistine let u fetch the ark of the covenant of the lord out of shiloh unto u that when it cometh among u it may save u out of the hand of our enemy so the people sent to shiloh that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the lord of host which dwelleth between the cherubims and the two son of eli hophni and phinehas be there with the ark of the covenant of god and when the ark of the covenant of the lord come into the camp all israel shout with great shout so that the earth rang again and when the philistine heard the noise of the shout they say what meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the hebrew and they understood that the ark of the lord be come into the camp and the philistine be afraid for they say god be come into the camp and they say woe unto u for there hath not be such thing heretofore woe unto u who shall deliver u out of the hand of these mighty god these be the god that smote the egyptian with all the plague in the wilderness be strong and quit yourselves like men ye philistine that ye be not servant unto the hebrew a they have be to you quit yourselves like men and fight and the philistine fought and israel be smitten and they flee every man into his tent and there be very great slaughter for there fell of israel thirty thousand footman and the ark of god be take and the two son of eli hophni and phinehas be slain and there ran man of benjamin out of the army and come to shiloh the same day with his clothes rent and with earth upon his head and when he come lo eli sat upon seat by the wayside watch for his heart tremble for the ark of god and when the man come into the city and told it all the city cry out and when eli heard the noise of the cry he say what meaneth the noise of this tumult and the man come in hastily and told eli now eli be ninety and eight year old and his eye be dim that he could not see and the man say unto eli be he that come out of the army and flee to day out of the army and he say what be there do my son and the messenger answer and say israel be flee before the philistine and there hath be also great slaughter among the people and thy two son also hophni and phinehas be dead and the ark of god be take and it come to pas when he make mention of the ark of god that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate and his neck brake and he die for he be an old man and heavy and he have judged israel forty year and his daughter in law phinehas wife be with child near to be deliver and when she heard the tidings that the ark of god be take and that her father in law and her husband be dead she bow herself and travail for her pain come upon her and about the time of her death the woman that stood by her say unto her fear not for thou hast born son but she answer not neither do she regard it and she name the child ichabod say the glory be depart from israel because the ark of god be take and because of her father in law and her husband and she say the glory be depart from israel for the ark of god be take and the philistine take the ark of god and brought it from ebenezer unto ashdod when the philistine take the ark of god they brought it into the house of dagon and set it by dagon and when they of ashdod arose early on the morrow behold dagon be fall upon his face to the earth before the ark of the lord and they take dagon and set him in his place again and when they arose early on the morrow morning behold dagon be fall upon his face to the ground before the ark of the lord and the head of dagon and both the palm of his hand be cut off upon the threshold only the stump of dagon be left to him therefore neither the priest of dagon nor any that come into dagon house tread on the threshold of dagon in ashdod unto this day but the hand of the lord be heavy upon them of ashdod and he destroyed them and smote them with emerods even ashdod and the coast thereof and when the men of ashdod saw that it be so they say the ark of the god of israel shall not abide with u for his hand be sore upon u and upon dagon our god they sent therefore and gather all the lord of the philistine unto them and say what shall we do with the ark of the god of israel and they answer let the ark of the god of israel be carry about unto gath and they carry the ark of the god of israel about thither and it be so that after they have carry it about the hand of the lord be against the city with very great destruction and he smote the men of the city both small and great and they have emerods in their secret part therefore they sent the ark of god to ekron and it come to pas a the ark of god come to ekron that the ekronites cry out say they have brought about the ark of the god of israel to u to slay u and our people so they sent and gather together all the lord of the philistine and say send away the ark of the god of israel and let it go again to his own place that it slay u not and our people for there be deadly destruction throughout all the city the hand of god be very heavy there and the men that die not be smitten with the emerods and the cry of the city go up to heaven and the ark of the lord be in the country of the philistine seven month and the philistine call for the priest and the diviner say what shall we do to the ark of the lord tell u wherewith we shall send it to his place and they say if ye send away the ark of the god of israel send it not empty but in any wise return him trespass offering then ye shall be heal and it shall be know to you why his hand be not remove from you then say they what shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him they answer five golden emerods and five golden mouse accord to the number of the lord of the philistine for one plague be on you all and on your lord wherefore ye shall make image of your emerods and image of your mouse that mar the land and ye shall give glory unto the god of israel peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you and from off your god and from off your land wherefore then do ye harden your heart a the egyptian and pharaoh harden their heart when he have wrought wonderfully among them do they not let the people go and they depart now therefore make new cart and take two milch kine on which there hath come no yoke and tie the kine to the cart and bring their calf home from them and take the ark of the lord and lay it upon the cart and put the jewel of gold which ye return him for trespass offering in coffer by the side thereof and send it away that it may go and see if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to bethshemesh then he hath do u this great evil but if not then we shall know that it be not his hand that smote u it be chance that happen to u and the men do so and take two milch kine and tie them to the cart and shut up their calf at home and they laid the ark of the lord upon the cart and the coffer with the mouse of gold and the image of their emerods and the kine take the straight way to the way of bethshemesh and go along the highway low a they go and turn not aside to the right hand or to the left and the lord of the philistine go after them unto the border of bethshemesh and they of bethshemesh be reap their wheat harvest in the valley and they lift up their eye and saw the ark and rejoice to see it and the cart come into the field of joshua bethshemite and stood there where there be great stone and they clave the wood of the cart and offer the kine burnt offering unto the lord and the levite take down the ark of the lord and the coffer that be with it wherein the jewel of gold be and put them on the great stone and the men of bethshemesh offer burnt offering and sacrifice sacrifice the same day unto the lord and when the five lord of the philistine have see it they return to ekron the same day and these be the golden emerods which the philistine return for trespass offering unto the lord for ashdod one for gaza one for askelon one for gath one for ekron one and the golden mouse accord to the number of all the city of the philistine belonging to the five lord both of fence city and of country village even unto the great

ark of the lord even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men and the people lament because the lord have smitten many of the people with great slaughter and the men of bethshemesh say who be able to stand before this holy lord god and to whom shall he go up from u and they sent messenger to the inhabitant of kirjathjearim say the philistine have brought again the ark of the lord come ye down and fetch it up to you and the men of kirjathjearim come and fetch up the ark of the lord and brought it into the house of abinadab in the hill and sanctify eleazar his son to keep the ark of the lord and it come to pas while the ark abode in kirjathjearim that the time be long for it be twenty year and all the house of israel lament after the lord and samuel spake unto all the house of israel say if ye do return unto the lord with all your heart then put away the strange god and ashtaroth from among you and prepare your heart unto the lord and serve him only and he will deliver you out of the hand of the philistine then the child of israel do put away baalim and ashtaroth and serve the lord only and samuel say gather all israel to mizpeh and will pray for you unto the lord and they gather together to mizpeh and drew water and pour it out before the lord and fast on that day and say there we have sin against the lord and samuel judged the child of israel in mizpeh and when the philistine heard that the child of israel be gather together to mizpeh the lord of the philistine go up against israel and when the child of israel heard it they be afraid of the philistine and the child of israel say to samuel cease not to cry unto the lord our god for u that he will save u out of the hand of the philistine and samuel take suck lamb and offer it for burnt offering wholly unto the lord and samuel cry unto the lord for israel and the lord heard him and a samuel be offering up the burnt offering the philistine drew near to battle against israel but the lord thunder with great thunder on that day upon the philistine and discomfit them and they be smitten before israel and the men of israel go out of mizpeh and pursue the philistine and smote them until they come under bethcar then samuel take stone and set it between mizpeh and shen and call the name of it ebenezer say hitherto hath the lord help u so the philistine be subdue and they come no more into the coast of israel and the hand of the lord be against the philistine all the day of samuel and the city which the philistine have take from israel be restore to israel from ekron even unto gath and the coast thereof do israel deliver out of the hand of the philistine and there be peace between israel and the amorites and samuel judged israel all the day of his life and he go from year to year in circuit to bethel and gilgal and mizpeh and judged israel in all those place and his return be to ramah for there be his house and there he judged israel and there he built an altar unto the lord and it come to pas when samuel be old that he make his son judge over israel now the name of his firstborn be joel and the name of his second abiah they be judge in beersheba and his son walk not in his way but turn aside after lucre and take bribe and pervert judgment then all the elder of israel gather themselves together and come to samuel unto ramah and say unto him behold thou art old and thy son walk not in thy way now make u king to judge u like all the nation but the thing displeased samuel when they say give u king to judge u and samuel prayed unto the lord and the lord say unto samuel hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee for they have not reject thee but they have reject me that should not reign over them accord to all the work which they have do since the day that brought them up out of egypt even unto this day wherewith they have forsaken me and serve other god so do they also unto thee now therefore hearken unto their voice howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them and samuel told all the word of the lord unto the people that ask of him king and he say this will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you he will take your son and appoint them for himself for his chariot and to be his horseman and some shall run before his chariot and he will appoint him captain over thousand and captain over fifty and will set them to ear his ground and to reap his harvest and to make his instrument of war and instrument of his chariot and he will

day nevertheless the people refuse to obey the voice of samuel and they say nay but we will have king over u that we also may be like all the nation and that our king may judge u and go out before u

chosen that there be none like him among all the people and all the people shout and say god save the king then samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom and write it in book and laid it up before the lord and samuel sent all the people away every man to his house and saul also go home to gibeah and there go with him band of men whose heart god have touch but the child of belial say how shall this man save u and they despise him and brought no present but he held his peace then nahash the ammonite come up and encamp against jabeshgilead and all the men of jabesh say unto nahash make covenant with u and we will serve thee and nahash the ammonite answer them on this condition will make covenant with you that may thrust out all your right eye and lay it for reproach upon all israel and the elder of jabesh say unto him give u seven day respite that we may send messenger unto all the coast of israel and then if there be no man to save u we will come out to thee then come the messenger to gibeah of saul and told the tidings in the ear of the people and all the people lift up their voice and wept and behold saul come after the herd out of the field and saul say what aileth

messenger that come thus shall ye say unto the men of jabeshgilead to morrow by that time the sun be hot ye shall have help and the messenger come and shew it to the men of jabesh and they be glad therefore the men of jabesh say to morrow we will come out unto you and ye shall do with u all that seemeth good unto you and it be so on the morrow that saul put the people in three company and they come into the midst of the host in the morning watch and slew the ammonite until the heat of the day and it come to pas that they which remain be scatter so that two of them be not left together and the people say unto samuel who be he that say shall saul reign over u bring the men that we may put them to death and saul say there shall not man be put to death this day for to day the lord hath wrought salvation in israel then say samuel to the people come and let u go to gilgal and renew the kingdom there and all the people go to gilgal and there they make saul king before the lord in gilgal and there they sacrifice sacrifice of peace offering before the lord and there saul and all the men of israel rejoice greatly and samuel say unto all israel behold have hearken unto your voice in all that ye say unto me and have make king over you and now behold the king walketh before you and be old and grayheaded and behold my son be with you and have walk before you from my childhood unto this day behold here be witness against me before the lord and before his anoint whose ox have take or whose as have take or whom have defraud whom have oppress or of whose hand have receive any bribe to blind mine eye therewith and will restore it you and they say thou hast not defraud u nor oppress u neither hast thou take ought of any man hand and he say unto them the lord be witness against you and his anoint be witness this day that ye have not found ought in my hand and they answer he be witness and samuel say unto the people it be the lord that advanced moses and aaron and that brought your father up out of the land of egypt now therefore stand still that may reason with you before the lord of all the righteous act of the lord which he do to you and to your father when jacob be come into egypt and your father cry unto the lord then the lord sent moses and aaron which brought forth your father out of egypt and make them dwell in this place and when they forgat the lord their god he sell them into the hand of sisera captain of the host of hazor and into the hand of the philistine and into the hand of the king of moab and they fought against them and they cry unto the lord and say we have sin because we have forsaken the lord and have serve baalim and ashtaroth but now deliver u out of the hand of our enemy and we will serve thee and the lord sent jerubbaal and bedan and jephthah and samuel and deliver you out of the hand of your enemy on every side and ye dwell safe and when ye saw that nahash the king of the child of ammon come against you ye say unto me nay but king shall reign over u when the lord your god be your king now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen and whom ye have desire and behold the lord hath set king over you if ye will fear the lord and serve him and obey his voice and not rebel against the commandment of the lord then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue follow the lord your god but if ye will not obey the voice of the lord but rebel against the commandment of the lord then shall the hand of the lord be against you a it be against your father now therefore stand and see this great thing which the lord will do before your eye be it not wheat harvest to day will call unto the lord and he shall send thunder and rain that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness be great which ye have do in the sight of the lord in ask you king so samuel call unto the lord and the lord sent thunder and rain that day and all the people greatly fear the lord and samuel and all the people say unto samuel pray for thy servant unto the lord thy god that we die not for we have add unto all our sin this evil to ask u king and samuel say unto the people fear not ye have do all this wickedness yet turn not aside from follow the lord but serve the lord with all your heart and turn ye not aside for then should ye go after vain thing which cannot profit nor deliver for they be vain for the lord will not forsake his people for his great name sake because it hath pleased the lord to make you his people moreover a for me god forbid that should sin against the lord in cease to pray for you but will teach you the good and the right way only fear the lord and serve him in truth with all your heart for consider how great thing he hath do for you but if ye shall still do wickedly ye shall be consume both ye and your king saul reign one year and when he have reign two year over israel saul chose him three thousand men of israel whereof two thousand be with saul in michmash and in mount bethel and thousand be with jonathan in gibeah of benjamin and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent and jonathan smote the garrison of the philistine that be in geba and the philistine heard of it and saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land say let the hebrew hear and all israel heard say that saul have smitten garrison of the philistine and that israel also be have in abomination with the philistine and the people be call together after saul to gilgal and the philistine gather themselves together to fight with israel thirty thousand chariot and six thousand horseman and people a the sand which be on the sea shore in multitude and they come up and pitch in michmash eastward from bethaven when the men of israel saw that they be in strait for the people be distressed then the people do hide themselves in cave and in thicket and in rock and in high place and in pit and some of the hebrew go over jordan to the land of gad and gilead a for saul he be yet in gilgal and all the people follow him tremble and he tarry seven day accord to the set time that samuel have appoint but samuel come not to gilgal and the people be scatter from him and saul say bring hither burnt offering to me and peace offering and he offer the burnt offering and it come to pas that a soon a he have make an end of offering the burnt offering behold samuel come and saul go out to meet him that he might salute him and samuel say what hast thou do and saul say because saw that the people be scatter from me and that thou camest not within the day appoint and that the philistine gather themselves together at michmash therefore say the philistine will come down now upon me to gilgal and have not make supplication unto the lord force myself therefore and offer burnt offering and samuel say to saul thou hast do foolishly thou hast not kept the commandment of the lord thy god which he command thee for now would the lord have establish thy kingdom upon israel for ever but now thy kingdom shall not continue the lord hath sought him man after his own heart and the lord hath command him to be captain over his people because thou hast not kept that which the lord command thee and samuel arose and gat him up from gilgal unto gibeah of benjamin and saul numbered the people that be present with him about six hundred men and saul and jonathan his son and the people that be present with them abode in gibeah of benjamin but the philistine encamp in michmash and the spoiler come out of the camp of the philistine in three company one company turn unto the way that leadeth to ophrah unto the land of shual and another company turn the way to bethhoron and another company turn to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of zeboim toward the wilderness now there be no smith found throughout all the land of israel for the philistine say l the hebrew make them sword or spear but all the israelite go down to the philistine to sharpen every man his share and his coulter and his axe and his mattock yet they have file for the mattock and for the coulter and for the fork and for the ax and to sharpen the goad so it come to pas in the day of battle that there be neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that be with saul and jonathan but with saul and with jonathan his son be there found and the garrison of the philistine go out to the passage of michmash now it come to pas upon day that jonathan the son of saul say unto the young man that bare his armour come and let u go over to the philistine garrison that be on the other side but he told not his father and saul tarry in the uttermost part of gibeah under pomegranate tree which be in migron and the people that be with him be about six hundred men and ahiah the son of ahitub ichabod brother the son of phinehas the son of eli the lord priest in shiloh wear an ephod and the people knew not that jonathan be go and between the passage by which jonathan sought to go over unto the philistine garrison there be sharp rock on the one side and sharp rock on the other side and the name of the one be bozez and the name of the other seneh the forefront of the one be situate northward over against michmash and the other southward over against gibeah and jonathan say to the young man that bare his armour come and let u go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised it may be that the lord will work for u for there be no restraint to the lord to save by many or by few and his armourbearer say unto him do all that be in thine heart turn thee behold be with thee accord to thy heart then say jonathan behold we will pas over unto these men and we will discover ourselves unto them if they say thus unto u tarry until we come to you then we will stand still in our place and will not go up unto them but if they say thus come up unto u then we will go up for the lord hath deliver them into our hand and this shall be sign unto u and both of them discover themselves unto the garrison of the philistine and the philistine say behold the hebrew come forth out of the hole where they have hid themselves and the men of the garrison answer jonathan and his armourbearer and say come up to u and we will shew you thing and jonathan say unto his armourbearer come up after me for the lord hath deliver them into the hand of israel and jonathan climbed up upon his hand and upon his foot and his armourbearer after him and they fell before jonathan and his armourbearer slew after him and that first slaughter which jonathan and his armourbearer make be about twenty men within a it be an half acre of land which yoke of ox might plow and there be tremble in the host in the field and among all the people the garrison and the spoiler they also tremble and the earth quaked so it be very great tremble and the watchman of saul in gibeah of benjamin look and behold the multitude melt away and they go on beating down one another then say saul unto the people that be with him number now and see who be go from u and when they have numbered behold jonathan and his armourbearer be not there and saul say unto ahiah bring hither the ark of god for the ark of god be at that time with the child of israel and it come to pas while saul talk unto the priest that the noise that be in the host of the philistine go on and increase and saul say unto the priest withdraw thine hand and saul and all the people that be with him assemble themselves and they come to the battle and behold every man sword be against his fellow and there be very great discomfiture moreover the hebrew that be with the philistine before that time which go up with them into the camp from the country round about even they also turn to be with the israelite that be with saul and jonathan likewise all the men of israel which have hid themselves in mount ephraim when they heard that the philistine flee even they also follow hard after them in the battle so the lord save israel that day and the battle pass over unto bethaven and the men of israel be distressed that day for saul have adjure the people say curse be the man that eateth any food until even that may be avenge on mine enemy so none of the people taste any food and all they of the land come to wood and there be honey upon the ground and when the people be come into the wood behold the honey drop but no man put his hand to his mouth for the people fear the oath but jonathan heard not when his father charge the people with the oath wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that be in his hand and dipped it in an honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth and his eye be enlighten then answer one of the people and say thy father straitly charge the people with an oath say curse be the man that eateth any food this day and the people be faint then say jonathan my father hath troubled the land see pray you how mine eye have be enlighten because taste little of this honey how much more if haply the people have eat freely to day of the spoil of their enemy which they found for have there not be now much great slaughter among the philistine and they smote the philistine that day from michmash to aijalon and the people be very faint and the people flew upon the spoil and take sheep and ox and calf and slew them on the ground and the people do eat them with the blood then they told saul say behold the people sin against the lord in that they eat with the blood and he say ye have transgress roll great stone unto me this day and saul say disperse yourselves among the people and say unto them bring me hither every man his ox and every man his sheep and slay them here and eat and sin not against the lord in eat with the blood and all the people brought every man his ox with him that night and slew them there and saul built an altar unto the lord the same be the first altar that he built unto the lord and saul say let u go down after the philistine by night and spoil them until the morning light and let u not leave man of them and they say do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee then say the priest let u draw near hither unto god and saul ask counsel of god shall go down after the philistine wilt thou deliver them into the hand of israel but he answer him not that day and saul say draw ye near hither all the chief of the people and know and see wherein this sin hath be this day for a the lord liveth which saveth israel though it be in jonathan my son he shall surely die but there be not man among all the people that answer him then say he unto all israel be ye on

to the fight and shout for the battle for israel and the philistine have put the battle in array army against army and david left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage and ran into the army and come and salute his brother and a he talk with them behold there come up the champion the philistine of gath goliath by name out of the army of the philistine and spake accord to the same word and david heard them and all the men of israel when they saw the man flee from him and be sore afraid and the men of israel say have ye see this man that be come up surely to defy israel be he come up and it shall be that the man who killeth him the king will enrich him with great rich and will give him his daughter and make his father house free in israel and david spake to the men that stood by him say what shall be do to the man that killeth this philistine and taketh away the reproach from israel for who be this uncircumcised philistine that he should defy the army of the living god and the people answer him after this manner say so shall it be do to the man that killeth him and eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men and eliab anger be kindle against david and he say why camest thou down hither and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness know thy pride and the naughtiness of thine heart for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle and david say what have now do be there not cause and he turn from him toward another and spake after the same manner and the people answer him again after the former manner and when the word be heard which david spake they rehearse them before saul and he sent for him and david say to saul let no man heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight with this philistine and saul say to david thou art not able to go against this philistine to fight with him for thou art but youth and he man of war from his youth and david say unto saul thy servant kept his father sheep and there come lion and bear and take lamb out of the flock and go out after him and smote him and deliver it out of his mouth and when he arose against me caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him thy servant slew both the lion and the bear and this uncircumcised philistine shall be a one of them see he hath defy the army of the living god david say moreover the lord that deliver me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of this philistine and saul say unto david go and the lord be with thee and saul arm david with his armour and he put an helmet of brass upon his head also he arm him with coat of mail and david gird his sword upon his armour and he assayed to go for he have not prove it and david say unto saul cannot go with these for have not prove them and david put them off him and he take his staff in his hand and chose him five smooth stone out of the brook and put them in shepherd bag which he have even in scrip and his sling be in his hand and he drew near to the philistine and the philistine come on and drew near unto david and the man that bare the shield go before him and when the philistine look about and saw david he disdain him for he be but youth and ruddy and of fair countenance and the philistine say unto david be dog that thou comest to me with stave and the philistine curse david by his god and the philistine say to david come to me and will give thy flesh unto the fowl of the air and to the beast of the field then say david to the philistine thou comest to me with sword and with spear and with shield but come to thee in the name of the lord of host the god of the army of israel whom thou hast defy this day will the lord deliver thee into mine hand and will smite thee and take thine head from thee and will give the carcase of the host of the philistine this day unto the fowl of the air and to the wild beast of the earth that all the earth may know that there be god in israel and all this assembly shall know that the lord saveth not with sword and spear for the battle be the lord and he will give you into our hand and it come to pas when the philistine arose and come and drew nigh to meet david that david hasten and ran toward the army to meet the philistine and david put his hand in his bag and take thence stone and slang it and smote the philistine in his forehead that the stone sunk into his forehead and he fell upon his face to the earth so david prevail over the philistine with sling and with stone and smote the philistine and slew him but there be no sword in the hand of david therefore david ran and stood upon the philistine and take his sword and drew it out of the sheath thereof and slew him and cut off his head therewith and when the philistine saw their champion be dead they flee and the men of israel and of judah arose and shout and pursue the philistine until thou come to the valley and to the gate of ekron and the wound of the philistine fell down by the way to shaaraim even unto gath and unto ekron and the child of israel return from chase after the philistine and they spoil their tent and david take the head of the philistine and brought it to jerusalem but he put his armour in his tent and when saul saw david go forth against the philistine he say unto abner the captain of the host abner whose son be this youth and abner say a thy soul liveth king cannot tell and the king say enquire thou whose son the stripling be and a david return from the slaughter of the philistine abner take him and brought him before saul with the head of the philistine in his hand and saul say to him whose son art thou thou young man and david answer be the son of thy servant jesse the bethlehemite and it come to pas when he have make an end of speak unto saul that the soul of jonathan be knit with the soul of david and jonathan love him a his own soul and saul take him that day and would let him go no more home to his father house then jonathan and david make covenant because he love him a his own soul and jonathan strip himself of the robe that be upon him and give it to david and his garment even to his sword and to his bow and to his girdle and david go out whithersoever saul sent him and behave himself wisely and saul set him over the men of war and he be accepted in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of saul servant and it come to pas a they come when david be return from the slaughter of the philistine that the woman come out of all city of israel sing and dance to meet king saul with tabrets with joy and with instrument of musick and the woman answer one another a they played and say saul hath slain his thousand and david his ten thousand and saul be very wroth and the say displeased him and he say they have ascribed unto david ten thousand and to me they have ascribed but thousand and what can he have more but the kingdom and saul eyed david from that day and forward and it come to pas on the morrow that the evil spirit from god come upon saul and he prophesy in the midst of the house and david played with his hand a at other time and there be javelin in saul hand and saul cast the javelin for he say will smite david even to the wall with it and david avoid out of his presence twice and saul be afraid of david because the lord be with him and be depart from saul therefore saul remove him from him and make him his captain over thousand and he go out and come in before the people and david behave himself wisely in all his way and the lord be with him wherefore when saul saw that he behave himself very wisely he be afraid of him but all israel and judah love david because he go out and come in before them and saul say to david behold my elder daughter merab her will give thee to wife only be thou valiant for me and fight the lord battle for saul say let not mine hand be upon him but let the hand of the philistine be upon him and david say unto saul who be and what be my life or my father family in israel that should be son in law to the king but it come to pas at the time when merab saul daughter should have be give to david that she be give unto adriel the meholathite to wife and michal saul daughter love david and they told saul and the thing pleased him and saul say will give him her that she may be snare to him and that the hand of the philistine may be against him wherefore saul say to david thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain and saul command his servant say commune with david secretly and say behold the king hath delight in thee and all his servant love thee now therefore be the king son in law and saul servant spake those word in the ear of david and david say seemeth it to you light thing to be king son in law see that be poor man and lightly esteem and the servant of saul told him say on this manner spake david and saul say thus shall ye say to david the king desireth not any dowry but an hundred foreskin of the philistine to be avenge of the king enemy but saul thought to make david fall by the hand of the philistine and when his servant told david these word it pleased david well to be the king son in law and the day be not expire wherefore david arose and go he and his men and slew of the philistine two hundred men and david brought their foreskin and they give them in full tale to the king that he might be the king son in law and saul give him michal his daughter to wife and saul saw and knew that the lord be with david and that michal saul daughter love him and saul be yet the more afraid of david and saul become david enemy continually then the prince of the philistine go forth and it come to pas after they go forth that david behave himself more wisely than all the servant of saul so that his name be much set by and saul spake to jonathan his son and to all his servant that they should kill david but jonathan saul son delighted much in david and jonathan told david say saul my father seeketh to kill thee now therefore pray thee take heed to thyself until the morning and abide in secret place and hide thyself and will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art and will commune with my father of thee and what see that will tell thee and jonathan spake good of david unto saul his father and say unto him let not the king sin against his servant against david because he hath not sin against thee and because his work have be to thee ward very good for he do put his life in his hand and slew the philistine and the lord wrought great salvation for all israel thou sawest it and didst rejoice wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood to slay david without cause and saul hearken unto the voice of jonathan and saul sware a the lord liveth he shall not be slain and jonathan call david and jonathan shew him all those thing and jonathan brought david to saul and he be in his presence a in time past and there be war again and david go out and fought with the philistine and slew them with great slaughter and they flee from him and the evil spirit from the lord be upon saul a he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand and david played with his hand and saul sought to smite david even to the wall with the javelin but he slip away out of saul presence and he smote the javelin into the wall and david flee and escape that night saul also sent messenger unto david house to watch him and to slay him in the morning and michal david wife told him say if thou save not thy life to night to morrow thou shalt be slain so michal let david down through window and he go and flee and escape and michal take an image and laid it in the bed and put pillow of goat hair for his bolster and cover it with cloth and when saul sent messenger to take david she say he be sick and saul sent the messenger again to see david say bring him up to me in the bed that may slay him and when the messenger be come in behold there be an image in the bed with pillow of goat hair for his bolster and saul say unto michal why hast thou deceive me so and sent away mine enemy that he be escape and michal answer saul he say unto me let me go why should kill thee so david flee and escape and come to samuel to ramah and told him all that saul have do to him and he and samuel go and dwelt in naioth and it be told saul say behold david be at naioth in ramah and saul sent messenger to take david and when they saw the company of the prophet prophesy and samuel stand a appoint over them the spirit of god be upon the messenger of saul and they also prophesy and when it be told saul he sent other messenger and they prophesy likewise and saul sent messenger again the third time and they prophesy also then go he also to ramah and come to great well that be in sechu and he ask and say where be samuel and david and one say behold they be at naioth in ramah and he go thither to naioth in ramah and the spirit of god be upon him also and he go on and prophesy until he come to naioth in ramah and he strip off his clothes also and prophesy before samuel in like manner and lay down naked all that day and all that night wherefore they say be saul also among the prophet and david flee from naioth in ramah and come and say before jonathan what have do what be mine iniquity and what be my sin before thy father that he seeketh my life and he say unto him god forbid thou shalt not die behold my father will do nothing either great or small but that he will shew it me and why should my father hide this thing from me it be not so and david sware moreover and say thy father certainly knoweth that have found grace in thine eye and he saith let not jonathan know this l he be grieve but truly a the lord liveth and a thy soul liveth there be but step between me and death then say jonathan unto david whatsoever thy soul desireth will even do it for thee and david say unto jonathan behold to morrow be the new moon and should not fail to sit with the king at meat but let me go that may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even if thy father at all miss me then say david earnestly ask leave of me that he might run to bethlehem his city for there be yearly sacrifice there for all the family if he say thus it be well thy servant shall have peace but if he be very wroth then be sure that evil be determine by him therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant for thou hast brought thy servant into covenant of the lord with thee notwithstanding if there be in me iniquity slay me thyself for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father and jonathan say far be it from thee for if knew certainly that evil be determine by my father to come upon thee then would not tell it thee then say david to jonathan who shall tell me or what if thy father answer thee roughly and jonathan say unto david come and let u go out into the field and they go out both of them into the field and jonathan say unto david lord god of israel when have sound my father about to morrow any time or the third day and behold if there be good toward david and then send not unto thee and shew it thee the lord do so and much more to jonathan but if it please my father to do thee evil then will shew it thee and send thee away that thou mayest go in peace and the lord be with thee a he hath be with my father and thou shalt not only while yet live shew me the kindness of the lord that die not but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever no not when the lord hath cut off the enemy of david every one from the face of the earth so jonathan make covenant with the house of david say let the lord even require it at the hand of david enemy and jonathan cause david to swear again because he love him for he love him a he love his own soul then jonathan say to david to morrow be the new moon and thou shalt be miss because thy seat will be empty and when thou hast stayed three day then thou shalt go down quickly and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business be in hand and shalt remain by the stone ezel and will shoot three arrow on the side thereof a though shot at mark and behold will send lad say go find out the arrow if expressly say unto the lad behold the arrow be on this side of thee take them then come thou for there be peace to thee and no hurt a the lord liveth but if say thus unto the young man behold the arrow be beyond thee go thy way for the lord hath sent thee away and a touch the matter which thou and have spoken of behold the lord be between thee and me for ever so david hid himself in the field and when the new moon be come the king sat him down to eat meat and the king sat upon his seat a at other time even upon seat by the wall and jonathan arose and abner sat by saul side and david place be empty nevertheless saul spake not any thing that day for he thought something hath befallen him he be not clean surely he be not clean and it come to pas on the morrow which be the second day of the month that david place be empty and saul say unto jonathan his son wherefore cometh not the son of jesse to meat neither yesterday nor to day and jonathan answer saul david earnestly ask leave of me to go to bethlehem and he say let me go pray thee for our family hath sacrifice in the city and my brother he hath command me to be there and now if have found favour in thine eye let me get away pray thee and see my brother therefore he cometh not unto the king table then saul anger be kindle against jonathan and he say unto him thou son of the perverse rebellious woman do not know that thou hast chosen the son of jesse to thine own confusion and unto the confusion of thy mother nakedness for a long a the son of jesse liveth upon the ground thou shalt not be establish nor thy kingdom wherefore now send and fetch him unto me for he shall surely die and jonathan answer saul his father and say unto him wherefore shall he be slain what hath he do and saul cast javelin at him to smite him whereby jonathan knew that it be determine of his father to slay david so jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger and do eat no meat the second day of the month for he be grieve for david because his father have do him shame and it come to pas in the morning that jonathan go out into the field at the time appoint with david and little lad with him and he say unto his lad run find out now the arrow which shoot and a the lad ran he shot an arrow beyond him and when the lad be come to the place of the arrow which jonathan have shot jonathan cry after the lad and say be not the arrow beyond thee and jonathan cry after the lad make speed haste stay not and jonathan lad gather up the arrow and come to his master but the lad knew not any thing only jonathan and david knew the matter and jonathan give his artillery unto his lad and say unto him go carry them to the city and a soon a the lad be go david arose out of place toward the south and fell on his face to the ground and bow himself three time and they kiss one another and wept one with another until david exceed and jonathan say to david go in peace forasmuch a we have sworn both of u in the name of the lord say the lord be between me and thee and between my seed and thy seed for ever and he arose and depart and jonathan go into the city then come david to nob to ahimelech the priest and ahimelech be afraid at the meeting of david and say unto him why art thou alone and no man with thee and david say unto ahimelech the priest the king hath command me business and hath say unto me let no man know any thing of the business whereabout send thee and what have command thee and have appoint my servant to such and such place now therefore what be under thine hand give me five loaf of bread in mine hand or what there be present and the priest answer david and say there be no common bread under mine hand but there be hallow bread if the young men have kept themselves at least from woman and david answer the priest and say unto him of truth woman have be kept from u about these three day since come out and the vessel of the young men be holy and the bread be in manner common yea though it be sanctify this day in the vessel so the priest give him hallow bread for there be no bread there but the shewbread that be take from before the lord to put hot bread in the day when it be take away now certain man of the servant of saul be there that day detain before the lord and his name be doeg an edomite the chiefest of the herdmen that belong to saul and david say unto ahimelech and be there not here under thine hand spear or sword for have neither brought my sword nor my weapon with me because the king business require haste and the priest say the sword of goliath the philistine whom thou slewest in the valley of elah behold it be here wrap in cloth behind the ephod if thou wilt take that take it for there be no other save that here and david say there be none like that give it me and david arose and flee that day for fear of saul and go to achish the king of gath and the servant of achish say unto him be not this david the king of the land do they not sing one to another of him in dance say saul hath slain his thousand and david his ten thousand and david laid up these word in his heart and be sore afraid of achish the king of gath and he change his behaviour before them and feign himself mad in their hand and scrabble on the door of the gate and let his spittle fall down upon his beard then say achish unto his servant lo ye see the man be mad wherefore then have ye brought him to me have need of mad men that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence shall this fellow come into my house david therefore depart thence and escape to the cave adullam and when his brother and all his father house heard it they go down thither to him and every one that be in distress and every one that be in debt and every one that be discontent gather themselves unto him and he become captain over them and there be with him about four hundred men and david go thence to mizpeh of moab and he say unto the king of moab let my father and my mother pray thee come forth and be with you till know what god will do for me and he brought them before the king of moab and they dwelt with him all the while that david be in the hold and the prophet gad say unto david abide not in the hold depart and get thee into the land of judah then david depart and come into the forest of hareth when saul heard that david be discover and the men that be with him now saul abode in gibeah under tree in ramah have his spear in his hand and all his servant be stand about him then saul say unto his servant that stood about him hear now ye benjamites will the son of jesse give every one of you field and vineyard and make you all captain of thousand and captain of hundred that all of you have conspire against me and there be none that sheweth me that my son hath make league with the son of jesse and there be none of you that be sorry for me or sheweth unto me that my son hath stir up my servant against me to lie

but david and his men gat them up unto the hold and samuel die and all the israelite be gather together and lament him and bury him in his house at ramah and david arose and go down to the wilderness of paran and there be man in maon whose possession be in carmel and the man be very great and he have three thousand sheep and thousand goat and he be shear his sheep in carmel now the name of the man be nabal and the name of his wife abigail and she be woman of good understand and of beautiful countenance but the man be churlish and evil in his doings and he be of the house of caleb and david heard in the wilderness that nabal do shear his sheep and david sent out ten young men and david say unto the young men get you up to carmel and go to nabal and greet him in my name and thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity peace be both to thee and peace be to thine house and peace be unto all that thou hast and now have heard that thou hast shearer now thy shepherd which be with u we hurt them not neither be there ought miss unto them all the while they be in carmel ask thy young men and they will shew thee wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eye for we come in good day give pray thee whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servant and to thy son david and when david young men come they spake to nabal accord to all those word in the name of david and cease and nabal answer david servant and say who be david and who be the son of jesse there be many servant now day that break away every man from his master shall then take my bread and my water and my flesh that have kill for my shearer and give it unto men whom know not whence they be so david young men turn their way and go again and come and told him all those saying and david say unto his men gird ye on every man his sword and they gird on every man his sword and david also gird on his sword and there go up after david about four hundred men and two hundred abode by the stuff but one of the young men told abigail nabal wife say behold david sent messenger out of the wilderness to salute our master and he rail on them but the men be very good unto u and we be not hurt neither miss we any thing a long a we be conversant with them when we be in the field they be wall unto u both by night and day all the while we be with them keep the sheep now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do for evil be determine against our master and against all his household for he be such son of belial that man cannot speak to him then abigail make haste and take two hundred loaf and two bottle of wine and five sheep ready dress and five measure of parch corn and an hundred cluster of raisin and two hundred cake of fig and laid them on ass and she say unto her servant go on before me behold come after you but she told not her husband nabal and it be so a she rode on the as that she come down by the covert on the hill and behold david and his men come down against her and she met them now david have say surely in vain have kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness so that nothing be miss of all that pertain unto him and he hath requite me evil for good so and more also do god unto the enemy of david if leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall and when abigail saw david she hasted and light off the as and fell before david on her face and bow herself to the ground and fell at his foot and say upon me my lord upon me let this iniquity be and let thine handmaid pray thee speak in thine audience and hear the word of thine handmaid let not my lord pray thee regard this man of belial even nabal for a his name be so be he nabal be his name and folly be with him but thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord whom thou didst send now therefore my lord a the lord liveth and a thy soul liveth see the lord hath withholden thee from come to shed blood and from avenge thyself with thine own hand now let thine enemy and they that seek evil to my lord be a nabal and now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord let it even be give unto the young men that follow my lord pray thee forgive the trespass of thine handmaid for the lord will certainly make my lord sure house because my lord fighteth the battle of the lord and evil hath not be found in thee all thy day yet man be risen to pursue thee and to seek thy soul but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the lord thy god and the soul of thine enemy them shall he sling out a out of the middle of sling and it shall come to pas when the lord shall have do to my lord accord to all the good that he hath spoken concern thee and shall have appoint thee ruler over israel that this shall be no grief unto thee nor offence of heart unto my lord either that thou hast shed blood causeless or that my lord hath avenge himself but when the lord shall have dealt well with my lord then remember thine handmaid and david say to abigail bless be the lord god of israel which sent thee this day to meet me and bless be thy advice and bless be thou which hast kept me this day from come to shed blood and from avenge myself with mine own hand for in very deed a the lord god of israel liveth which hath kept me back from hurt thee except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me surely there have not be left unto nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall so david receive of her hand that which she have brought him and say unto her go up in peace to thine house see have hearken to thy voice and have accepted thy person and abigail come to nabal and behold he held feast in his house like the feast of king and nabal heart be merry within him for he be very drunken wherefore she told him nothing less or more until the morning light but it come to pas in the morning when the wine be go out of nabal and his wife have told him these thing that his heart die within him and he become a stone and it come to pas about ten day after that the lord smote nabal that he die and when david heard that nabal be dead he say bless be the lord that hath plead the cause of my reproach from the hand of nabal and hath kept his servant from evil for the lord hath return the wickedness of nabal upon his own head and david sent and commune with abigail to take her to him to wife and when the servant of david be come to abigail to carmel they spake unto her say david sent u unto thee to take thee to him to wife and she arose and bow herself on her face to the earth and say behold let thine handmaid be servant to wash the foot of the servant of my lord and abigail hasted and arose and rode upon an as with five damsel of hers that go after her and she go after the messenger of david and become his wife david also take ahinoam of jezreel and they be also both of them his wife but saul have give michal his daughter david wife to phalti the son of laish which be of gallim and the ziphites come unto saul to gibeah say doth not david hide himself in the hill of hachilah which be before jeshimon then saul arose and go down to the wilderness of ziph have three thousand chosen men of israel with him to seek david in the wilderness of ziph and saul pitch in the hill of hachilah which be before jeshimon by the way but david abode in the wilderness and he saw that saul come after him into the wilderness david therefore sent out spy and understood that saul be come in very deed and david arose and come to the place where saul have pitch and david beheld the place where saul lay and abner the son of ner the captain of his host and saul lay in the trench and the people pitch round about him then answer david and say to ahimelech the hittite and to abishai the son of zeruiah brother to joab say who will go down with me to saul to the camp and abishai say will go down with thee so david and abishai come to the people by night and behold saul lay sleep within the trench and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster but abner and the people lay round about him then say abishai to david god hath deliver thine enemy into thine hand this day now therefore let me smite him pray thee with the spear even to the earth at once and will not smite him the second time and david say to abishai destroy him not for who can stretch forth his hand against the lord anoint and be guiltless david say furthermore a the lord liveth the lord shall smite him or his day shall come to die or he shall descend into battle and perish the lord forbid that should stretch forth mine hand against the lord anoint but pray thee take thou now the spear that be at his bolster and the cruse of water and let u go so david take the spear and the cruse of water from saul bolster and they gat them away and no man saw it nor knew it neither awaked for they be all asleep because deep sleep from the lord be fall upon them then david go over to the other side and stood on the top of an hill afar off great space be between them and david cry to the people and to abner the son of ner say answerest thou not abner then abner answer and say who art thou that criest to the king and david say to abner art not thou valiant man and who be like to thee in israel wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king for there come one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord this thing be not good that thou hast do a the lord liveth ye be worthy to die because ye have not kept your master the lord anoint and now see where the king spear be and the cruse of water that be at his bolster and saul knew david voice and say be this thy voice my son david and david say it be my voice my lord king and he say wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant for what have do or what evil be in mine hand now therefore pray thee let my lord the king hear the word of his servant if the lord have stir thee up against me let him accept an offering but if they be the child of men curse be they before the lord for they have driven me out this day from abide in the inheritance of the lord say go serve other god now therefore let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the lord for the king of israel be come out to seek flea a when one doth hunt partridge in the mountain then say saul have sin return my son david for will no more do thee harm because my soul be precious in thine eye this day behold have played the fool and have err exceedingly and david answer and say behold the king spear and let one of the young men come over and fetch it the lord render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness for the lord deliver thee into my hand to day but would not stretch forth mine hand against the lord anoint and behold a thy life be much set by this day in mine eye so let my life be much set by in the eye of the lord and let him deliver me out of all tribulation then saul say to david bless be thou my son david thou shalt both do great thing and also shalt still prevail so david go on his way and saul return to his place and david say in his heart shall now perish one day by the hand of saul there be nothing well for me than that should speedily escape into the land of the philistine and saul shall despair of me to seek me any more in any coast of israel so shall escape out of his hand and david arose and he pass over with the six hundred men that be with him unto achish the son of maoch king of gath and david dwelt with achish at gath he and his men every man with his household even david with his two wife ahinoam the jezreelitess and abigail the carmelite nabal wife and it be told saul that david be flee to gath and he sought no more again for him and david say unto achish if have now found grace in thine eye let them give me place in some town in the country that may dwell there for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee then achish give him ziklag that day wherefore ziklag pertaineth unto the king of judah unto this day and the time that david dwelt in the country of the philistine be full year and four month and david and his men go up and invade the geshurites and the gezrites and the amalekites for those nation be of old the inhabitant of the land a thou goest to shur even unto the land of egypt and david smote the land and left neither man nor woman alive and take away the sheep and the ox and the ass and the camel and the apparel and return and come to achish and achish say whither have ye make road to day and david say against the south of judah and against the south of the jerahmeelites and against the south of the kenites and david save neither man nor woman alive to bring tidings to gath say l they should tell on u say so do david and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the philistine and achish believe david say he hath make his people israel utterly to abhor him therefore he shall be my servant for ever and it come to pas in those day that the philistine gather their army together for warfare to fight with israel and achish say unto david know thou assuredly that thou shalt go out with me to battle thou and thy men and david say to achish surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do and achish say to david therefore will make thee keeper of mine head for ever now samuel be dead and all israel have lament him and bury him in ramah even in his own city and saul have put away those that have familiar spirit and the wizard out of the land and the philistine gather themselves together and come and pitch in shunem and saul gather all israel together and they pitch in gilboa and when saul saw the host of the philistine he be afraid and his heart greatly tremble and when saul enquire of the lord the lord answer him not neither by dream nor by urim nor by prophet then say saul unto his servant seek me woman that hath familiar spirit that may go to her and enquire of her and his servant say to him behold there be woman that hath familiar spirit at endor and saul disguise himself and put on other raiment and he go and two men with him and they come to the woman by night and he say pray thee divine unto me by the familiar spirit and bring me him up whom shall name unto thee and the woman say unto him behold thou knowest what saul hath do how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirit and the wizard out of the land wherefore then lay thou snare for my life to cause me to die and saul sware to her by the lord say a the lord liveth there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing then say the woman whom shall bring up unto thee and he say bring me up samuel and when the woman saw samuel she cry with loud voice and the woman spake to saul say why hast thou deceive me for thou art saul and the king say unto her be not afraid for what sawest thou and the woman say unto saul saw god ascend out of the earth and he say unto her what form be he of and she say an old man cometh up and he be cover with mantle and saul perceive that it be samuel and he stoop with his face to the ground and bow himself and samuel say to saul why hast thou disquiet me to bring me up and saul answer be sore distressed for the philistine make war against me and god be depart from me and answereth me no more neither by prophet nor by dream therefore have call thee that thou mayest make know unto me what shall do then say samuel wherefore then dost thou ask of me see the lord be depart from thee and be become thine enemy and the lord hath do to him a he spake by me for the lord hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand and give it to thy neighbour even to david because thou obeyedst not the voice of the lord nor executedst his fierce wrath upon amalek therefore hath the lord do this thing unto thee this day moreover the lord will also deliver israel with thee into the hand of the philistine and to morrow shalt thou and thy son be with me the lord also shall deliver the host of israel into the hand of the philistine then saul fell straightway all along on the earth and be sore afraid because of the word of samuel and there be no strength in him for he have eat no bread all the day nor all the night and the woman come unto saul and saw that he be sore troubled and say unto him behold thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice and have put my life in my hand and have hearken unto thy word which thou spakest unto me now therefore pray thee hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid and let me set morsel of bread before thee and eat that thou mayest have strength when thou goest on thy way but he refuse and say will not eat but his servant together with the woman compel him and he hearken unto their voice so he arose from the earth and sat upon the bed and the woman have fat calf in the house and she hasted and kill it and take flour and knead it and do bake unleavened bread thereof and she brought it before saul and before his servant and they do eat then they rise up and go away that night now the philistine gather together all their army to aphek and the israelite pitch by fountain which be in jezreel and the lord of the philistine pass on by hundred and by thousand but david and his men pass on in the rereward with achish then say the prince of the philistine what do these hebrew here and achish say unto the prince of the philistine be not this david the servant of saul the king of israel which hath be with me these day or these year and have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day and the prince of the philistine be wroth with him and the prince of the philistine say unto him make this fellow return that he may go again to his place which thou hast appoint him and let him not go down with u to battle l in the battle he be an adversary to u for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master should it not be with the head of these men be not this david of whom they sang one to another in dance say saul slew his thousand and david his ten thousand then achish call david and say unto him surely a the lord liveth thou hast be upright and thy go out and thy come in with me in the host be good in my sight for have not found evil in thee since the day of thy come unto me unto this day nevertheless the lord favour thee not wherefore now return and go in peace that thou displease not the lord of the philistine and david say unto achish but what have do and what hast thou found in thy servant so long a have be with thee unto this day that may not go fight against the enemy of my lord the king and achish answer and say to david know that thou art good in my sight a an angel of god notwithstanding the prince of the philistine have say he shall not go up with u to the battle wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master servant that be come with thee and a soon a ye be up early in the morning and have light depart so david and his men rise up early to depart in the morning to return into the land of the philistine and the philistine go up to jezreel and it come to pas when david and his men be come to ziklag on the third day that the amalekites have invade the south and ziklag and smitten ziklag and burn it with fire and have take the woman captive that be therein they slew not any either great or small but carry them away and go on their way so david and his men come to the city and behold it be burn with fire and their wife and their son and their daughter be take captive then david and the people that be with him lift up their voice and wept until they have no more power to weep and david two wife be take captive ahinoam the jezreelitess and abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite and david be greatly distressed for the people spake of stone him because the soul of all the people be grieve every man for his son and for his daughter but david encourage himself in the lord his god and david say to abiathar the priest ahimelech son pray thee bring me hither the ephod and abiathar brought thither the ephod to david and david enquire at the lord say shall pursue after this troop shall overtake them and he answer him pursue for thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all so david go he and the six hundred men that be with him and come to the brook besor where those that be left behind stayed but david pursue he and four hundred men for two hundred abode behind which be so faint that they could not go over the brook besor and they found an egyptian in the field and brought him to david and give him bread and he do eat and they make him drink water and they give him piece of cake of fig and two cluster of raisin and when he have eat his spirit come again to him for he have eat no bread nor drunk any water three day and three night and david say unto him to whom belongest thou and whence art thou and he say be young man of egypt servant to an amalekite and my master left me because three day agone fell sick we make an invasion upon the south of the cherethites and upon the coast which belongeth to judah and upon the south of caleb and we burn ziklag with fire and david say to him canst thou bring me down to this company and he say swear unto me by god that thou wilt neither kill me nor deliver me into the hand of my master and will bring thee down to this company and when he have brought him down behold they be spread abroad upon all the earth eat and drinking and dance because of all the great spoil that they have take out of the land of the philistine and out of the land of judah and david smote them from the twilight even unto the even of the next day and there escape not man of them save four hundred young men which rode upon camel and flee and david recover all that the amalekites have carry away and david rescue his two wife and there be nothing lack to them neither small nor great neither son nor daughter neither spoil nor any thing that they have take to them david recover all and david take all the flock and the herd which they drave before those other cattle and say this be david spoil and david come to the two hundred men which be so faint that they could not follow david whom they have make also to abide at the brook besor and they go forth to meet david and to meet the people that be with him and when david come near to the people he salute them then answer all the wicked men and men of belial of those that go with david and say because they go not with u we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recover save to every man his wife and his child that they may lead them away and depart then say david ye shall not do so my brother with that which the lord hath give u who hath preserve u and deliver the company that come against u into our hand for who will hearken unto you in this matter but a his part be that goeth down to the battle so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff they shall part alike and it be so from that day forward that he make it statute and an ordinance for israel

the hand of uriah and he write in the letter say set ye uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle and retire ye from him that he may be smitten and die and it come to pas when joab observe the city that he assign uriah unto place where he knew that valiant men be and the men of the city go out and fought with joab and there fell some of the people of the servant of david and uriah the hittite die also then joab sent and told david all the thing concern the war and charge the messenger say when thou hast make an end of tell the matter of the war unto the king and if so be that the king wrath arise and he say unto thee wherefore approach ye so nigh unto the city when ye do fight knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall who smote abimelech the son of jerubbesheth do not woman cast piece of millstone upon him from the wall that he die in thebez why go ye nigh the wall then say thou thy servant uriah the hittite be dead also so the messenger go and come and shew david all that joab have sent him for and the messenger say unto david surely the men prevail against u and come out unto u into the field and we be upon them even unto the enter of the gate and the shooter shot from off the wall upon thy servant and some of the king servant be dead and thy servant uriah the hittite be dead also then david say unto the messenger thus shalt thou say unto joab let not this thing displease thee for the sword devoureth one a well a another make thy battle more strong against the city and overthrow it and encourage thou him and when the wife of uriah heard that uriah her husband be dead she mourn for her husband and when the mourn be past david sent and fetch her to his house and she become his wife and bare him son but the thing that david have do displeased the lord and the lord sent nathan unto david and he come unto him and say unto him there be two men in one city the one rich and the other poor the rich man have exceed many flock and herd but the poor man have nothing save one little ewe lamb which he have bought and nourish up and it grow up together with him and with his child it do eat of his own meat and drank of his own cup and lay in his bosom and be unto him a daughter and there come traveller unto the rich man and he spar to take of his own flock and of his own herd to dress for the wayfaring man that be come unto him but take the poor man lamb and dress it for the man that be come to him and david anger be greatly kindle against the man and he say to nathan a the lord liveth the man that hath do this thing shall surely die and he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he do this thing and because he have no pity and nathan say to david thou art the man thus saith the lord god of israel anoint thee king over israel and deliver thee out of the hand of saul and give thee thy master house and thy master wife into thy bosom and give thee the house of israel and of judah and if that have be too little would moreover have give unto thee such and such thing wherefore hast thou despise the commandment of the lord to do evil in his sight thou hast kill uriah the hittite with the sword and hast take his wife to be thy wife and hast slain him with the sword of the child of ammon now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house because thou hast despise me and hast take the wife of uriah the hittite to be thy wife thus saith the lord behold will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house and will take thy wife before thine eye and give them unto thy neighbour and he shall lie with thy wife in the sight of this sun for thou didst it secretly but will do this thing before all israel and before the sun and david say unto nathan have sin against the lord and nathan say unto david the lord also hath put away thy sin thou shalt not die howbeit because by this deed thou hast give great occasion to the enemy of the lord to blaspheme the child also that be born unto thee shall surely die and nathan depart unto his house and the lord struck the child that uriah wife bare unto david and it be very sick david therefore besought god for the child and david fast and go in and lay all night upon the earth and the elder of his house arose and go to him to raise him up from the earth but he would not neither do he eat bread with them and it come to pas on the seventh day that the child die and the servant of david fear to tell him that the child be dead for they say behold while the child be yet alive we spake unto him and he would not hearken unto our voice how will he then vex himself if we tell him that the child be dead but when david saw that his servant whisper david perceive that the child be dead therefore david say unto his servant be the child dead and they say he be dead then david arose from the earth and wash and anoint himself and change his apparel and come into the house of the lord and worship then he come to his own house and when he require they set bread before him and he do eat then say his servant unto him what thing be this that thou hast do thou didst fast and weep for the child while it be alive but when the child be dead thou didst rise and eat bread and he say while the child be yet alive fast and wept for say who can tell whether god will be gracious to me that the child may live but now he be dead wherefore should fast can bring him back again shall go to him but he shall not return to me and david comfort bathsheba his wife and go in unto her and lay with her and she bare son and he call his name solomon and the lord love him and he sent by the hand of nathan the prophet and he call his name jedidiah because of the lord and joab fought against rabbah of the child of ammon and take the royal city and joab sent messenger to david and say have fought against rabbah and have take the city of water now therefore gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it l take the city and it be call after my name and david gather all the people together and go to rabbah and fought against it and take it and he take their king crown from off his head the weight whereof be talent of gold with the precious stone and it be set on david head and he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance and he brought forth the people that be therein and put them under saw and under harrow of iron and under ax of iron and make them pas through the brick kiln and thus do he unto all the city of the child of ammon so david and all the people return unto jerusalem and it come to pas after this that absalom the son of david have fair sister whose name be tamar and amnon the son of david love her and amnon be so vexed that he fell sick for his sister tamar for she be virgin and amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to her but amnon have friend whose name be jonadab the son of shimeah david brother and jonadab be very subtil man and he say unto him why art thou be the king son lean from day to day wilt thou not tell me and amnon say unto him love tamar my brother absalom sister and jonadab say unto him lay thee down on thy bed and make thyself sick and when thy father cometh to see thee say unto him pray thee let my sister tamar come and give me meat and dress the meat in my sight that may see it and eat it at her hand so amnon lay down and make himself sick and when the king be come to see him amnon say unto the king pray thee let tamar my sister come and make me couple of cake in my sight that may eat at her hand then david sent home to tamar say go now to thy brother amnon house and dress him meat so tamar go to her brother amnon house and he be laid down and she take flour and knead it and make cake in his sight and do bake the cake and she take pan and pour them out before him but he refuse to eat and amnon say have out all men from me and they go out every man from him and amnon say unto tamar bring the meat into the chamber that may eat of thine hand and tamar take the cake which she have make and brought them into the chamber to amnon her brother and when she have brought them unto him to eat he take hold of her and say unto her come lie with me my sister and she answer him nay my brother do not force me for no such thing ought to be do in israel do not thou this folly and whither shall cause my shame to go and a for thee thou shalt be a one of the fool in israel now therefore pray thee speak unto the king for he will not withhold me from thee howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice but be strong than she force her and lay with her then amnon hat her exceedingly so that the hatred wherewith he hat her be great than the love wherewith he have love her and amnon say unto her arise be go and she say unto him there be no cause this evil in send me away be great than the other that thou didst unto me but he would not hearken unto her then he call his servant that minister unto him and say put now this woman out from me and bolt the door after her and she have garment of diver colour upon her for with such robe be the king daughter that be virgin apparelled then his servant brought her out and bolt the door after her and tamar put ash on her head and rent her garment of diver colour that be on her and laid her hand on her head and go on cry and absalom her brother say unto her hath amnon thy brother be with thee but hold now thy peace my sister he be thy brother regard not this thing so tamar remain desolate in her brother absalom house but when king david heard of all these thing he be very wroth and absalom spake unto his brother amnon neither good nor bad for absalom hat amnon because he have force his sister tamar and it come to pas after two full year that absalom have sheepshearers in baalhazor which be beside ephraim and absalom invite all the king son and absalom come to the king and say behold now thy servant hath sheepshearers let the king beseech thee and his servant go with thy servant and the king say to absalom nay my son let u not all now go l we be chargeable unto thee and he press him howbeit he would not go but bless him then say absalom if not pray thee let my brother amnon go with u and the king say unto him why should he go with thee but absalom press him that he let amnon and all the king son go with him now absalom have command his servant say mark ye now when amnon heart be merry with wine and when say unto you smite amnon then kill him fear not have not command you be courageous and be valiant and the servant of absalom do unto amnon a absalom have command then all the king son arose and every man gat him up upon his mule and flee and it come to pas while they be in the way that tidings come to david say absalom hath slain all the king son and there be not one of them left then the king arose and tare his garment and lay on the earth and all his servant stood by with their clothes rent and jonadab the son of shimeah david brother answer and say let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king son for amnon only be dead for by the appointment of absalom this hath be determine from the day that he force his sister tamar now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart to think that all the king son be dead for amnon only be dead but absalom flee and the young man that kept the watch lift up his eye and look and behold there come much people by the way of the hill side behind him and jonadab say unto the king behold the king son come a thy servant say so it be and it come to pas a soon a he have make an end of speak that behold the king son come and lift up their voice and wept and the king also and all his servant wept very sore but absalom flee and go to talmai the son of ammihud king of geshur and david mourn for his son every day so absalom flee and go to geshur and be there three year and the soul of king david long to go forth unto absalom for he be comfort concern amnon see he be dead now joab the son of zeruiah perceive that the king heart be toward absalom and joab sent to tekoah and fetch thence wise woman and say unto her pray thee feign thyself to be mourner and put on now mourn apparel and anoint not thyself with oil but be a woman that have long time mourn for the dead and come to the king and speak on this manner unto him so joab put the word in her mouth and when the woman of tekoah spake to the king she fell on her face to the ground and do obeisance and say help king and the king say unto her what aileth thee and she answer be indeed widow woman and mine husband be dead and thy handmaid have two son and they two strove together in the field and there be none to part them but the one smote the other and slew him and behold the whole family be risen against thine handmaid and they say deliver him that smote his brother that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew and we will destroy the heir also and so they shall quench my coal which be left and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth and the king say unto the woman go to thine house and will give charge concern thee and the woman of tekoah say unto the king my lord king the iniquity be on me and on my father house and the king and his throne be guiltless and the king say whoever saith ought unto thee bring him to me and he shall not touch thee any more then say she pray thee let the king remember the lord thy god that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more l they destroy my son and he say a the lord liveth there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth then the woman say let thine handmaid pray thee speak one word unto my lord the king and he say say on and the woman say wherefore then hast thou thought such thing against the people of god for the king doth speak this thing a one which be faulty in that the king doth not fetch home again his banish for we must need die and be a water spilt on the ground which cannot be gather up again neither doth god respect any person yet doth he devise mean that his banish be not expel from him now therefore that be come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king it be because the people have make me afraid and thy handmaid say will now speak unto the king it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid for the king will hear to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of god then thine handmaid say the word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable for a an angel of god so be my lord the king to discern good and bad therefore the lord thy god will be with thee then the king answer and say unto the woman hide not from me pray thee the thing that shall ask thee and the woman say let my lord the king now speak and the king say be not the hand of joab with thee in all this and the woman answer and say a thy soul liveth my lord the king none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken for thy servant joab he bade me and he put all these word in the mouth of thine handmaid to fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant joab do this thing and my lord be wise accord to the wisdom of an angel of god to know all thing that be in the earth and the king say unto joab behold now have do this thing go therefore bring the young man absalom again and joab fell to the ground on his face and bow himself and thanked the king and joab say to day thy servant knoweth that have found grace in thy sight my lord king in that the king hath fulfil the request of his servant so joab arose and go to geshur and brought absalom to jerusalem and the king say let him turn to his own house and let him not see my face so absalom return to his own house and saw not the king face but in all israel there be none to be so much praise a absalom for his beauty from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there be no blemish in him and when he poll his head for it be at every year end that he poll it because the hair be heavy on him therefore he poll it he weigh the hair of his head at two hundred shekel after the king weight and unto absalom there be born three son and one daughter whose name be tamar she be woman of fair countenance so absalom dwelt two full year in jerusalem and saw not the king face therefore absalom sent for joab to have sent him to the king but he would not come to him and when he sent again the second time he would not come therefore he say unto his servant see joab field be near mine and he hath barley there go and set it on fire and absalom servant set the field on fire then joab arose and come to absalom unto his house and say unto him wherefore have thy servant set my field on fire and absalom answer joab behold sent unto thee say come hither that may send thee to the king to say wherefore be come from geshur it have be good for me to have be there still now therefore let me see the king face and if there be any iniquity in me let him kill me so joab come to the king and told him and when he have call for absalom he come to the king and bow himself on his face to the ground before the king and the king kiss absalom and it come to pas after this that absalom prepared him chariot and horse and fifty men to run before him and absalom rise up early and stood beside the way of the gate and it be so that when any man that have controversy come to the king for judgment then absalom call unto him and say of what city art thou and he say thy servant be of one of the tribe of israel and absalom say unto him see thy matter be good and right but there be no man depute of the king to hear thee absalom say moreover oh that be make judge in the land that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me and would do him justice and it be so that when any man come nigh to him to do him obeisance he put forth his hand and take him and kiss him and on this manner do absalom to all israel that come to the king for judgment so absalom stole the heart of the men of israel and it come to pas after forty year that absalom say unto the king pray thee let me go and pay my vow which have vowed unto the lord in hebron for thy servant vowed vow while abode at geshur in syria say if the lord shall bring me again indeed to jerusalem then will serve the lord and the king say unto him go in peace so he arose and go to hebron but absalom sent spy throughout all the tribe of israel say a soon a ye hear the sound of the trumpet then ye shall say absalom reigneth in hebron and with absalom go two hundred men out of jerusalem that be call and they go in their simplicity and they knew not any thing and absalom sent for ahithophel the gilonite david counsellor from his city even from giloh while he offer sacrifice and the conspiracy be strong for the people increase continually with absalom and there come messenger to david say the heart of the men of israel be after absalom and david say unto all his servant that be with him at jerusalem arise and let u flee for we shall not else escape from absalom make speed to depart l he overtake u suddenly and bring evil upon u and smite the city with the edge of the sword and the king servant say unto the king behold thy servant be ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint and the king go forth and all his household after him and the king left ten woman which be concubine to keep the house and the king go forth and all the people after him and tarry in place that be far off and all his servant pass on beside him and all the cherethites and all the pelethites and all the gittites six hundred men which come after him from gath pass on before the king then say the king to ittai the gittite wherefore goest thou also with u return to thy place and abide with the king for thou art stranger and also an exile whereas thou camest but yesterday should this day make thee go up and down with u see go whither may return thou and take back thy brother mercy and truth be with thee and ittai answer the king and say a the lord liveth and a my lord the king liveth surely in what place my lord the king shall be whether in death or life even there also will thy servant be and david say to ittai go and pas over and ittai the gittite pass over and all his men and all the little one that be with him and all the country wept with loud voice and all the people pass over the king also himself pass over the brook kidron and all the people pass over toward the way of the wilderness and lo zadok also and all the levite be with him bearing the ark of the covenant of god and they set down the ark of god and abiathar go up until all the people have do passing out of the city and the king say unto zadok carry back the ark of god into the city if shall find favour in the eye of the lord he will bring me again and shew me both it and his habitation but if he thus say have no delight in thee behold here be let him do to me a seemeth good unto him the king say also unto zadok the priest art not thou seer return into the city in peace and your two son with you ahimaaz thy son and jonathan the son of abiathar see will tarry in the plain of the wilderness until there come word from you to certify me zadok therefore and abiathar carry the ark of god again to jerusalem and they tarry there and david go up by the ascent of mount olivet and wept a he go up and have his head cover and he go barefoot and all the people that be with him cover every man his head and they go up weep a they go up and one told david say ahithophel be among the conspirator with absalom and david say lord pray thee turn the counsel of ahithophel into foolishness and it come to pas that when david be come to the top of the mount where he worship god behold hushai the archite come to meet him with his coat rent and earth upon his head unto whom david say if thou passest on with me then thou shalt be burden unto me but if thou return to the city and say unto absalom will be thy servant king a have be thy father servant hitherto so will now also be thy servant then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of ahithophel and hast thou not there with thee zadok and abiathar the priest therefore it shall be that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king house thou shalt tell it to zadok and abiathar the priest behold they have there with them their two son ahimaaz zadok son and jonathan abiathar son and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear so hushai david friend come into the city and absalom come into jerusalem and when david be little past the top of the hill behold ziba the servant of mephibosheth met him with couple of ass saddle and upon them two hundred loaf of bread and an hundred bunch of raisin and an hundred of summer fruit and bottle of wine and the king say unto ziba what mean thou by these and ziba say the ass be for the king household to ride on and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat and the wine that such a be faint in the wilderness may drink and the king say and where be thy master son and ziba say unto the king behold he abideth at jerusalem for he say to day shall the house of israel restore me the kingdom of my father then say the king to ziba behold thine be all that pertain unto mephibosheth and ziba say humbly beseech thee that may find grace in thy sight my lord king and when king david come to bahurim behold thence come out man of the family of the house of saul whose name be shimei the son of gera he come forth and curse still a he come and he cast stone at david and at all the servant of king david and all the people and all the mighty men be on his right hand and on his left and thus say shimei when he curse come out come out thou bloody man and thou man of belial the lord hath return upon thee all the blood of the house of saul in whose stead thou hast reign and the lord hath deliver the kingdom into the hand of absalom thy son and behold thou art take in thy mischief because thou art bloody man then say abishai the son of zeruiah unto the king why should this dead dog curse my lord the king let me go over pray thee and take off his head and the king say what have to do with you ye son of zeruiah so let him curse because the lord hath say unto him curse david who shall then say wherefore hast thou do so and david say to abishai and to all his servant behold my son which come forth of my bowel seeketh my life how much more now may this benjamite do it let him alone and let him curse for the lord hath bidden him it may be that the lord will look on mine affliction and that the lord will requite me good for his curse this day and a david and his men go by the way shimei go along on the hill side over against him and curse a he go and threw stone at him and cast dust and the king and all the people that be with him come weary and refresh themselves there and absalom and all the people the men of israel come to jerusalem and ahithophel with him and it come to pas when hushai the archite david friend be come unto absalom that hushai say unto absalom god save the king god save the king and absalom say to hushai be this thy kindness to thy friend why wentest thou not with thy friend and hushai say unto absalom nay but whom the lord and this people and all the men of israel choose his will be and with him will abide and again whom should serve should not serve in the presence of his son a have serve in thy father presence so will be in thy presence then say absalom to ahithophel give counsel among you what we shall do and ahithophel say unto absalom go in unto thy father concubine which he hath left to keep the house and all israel shall hear that thou art abhor of thy father then shall the hand of all that be with thee be strong so they spread absalom tent upon the top of the house and absalom go in unto his father concubine in the sight of all israel and the counsel of ahithophel which he counsel in those day be a if man have enquire at the oracle of god so be all the counsel of ahithophel both with david and with absalom moreover ahithophel say unto absalom let me now choose out twelve thousand men and will arise and pursue after david this night and will come upon him while he be weary and weak hand and will make him afraid and all the people that be with him shall flee and will smite the king only and will bring back all the people unto thee the man whom thou seekest be a if all return so all the people shall be in peace and the say pleased absalom well and all the elder of israel then say absalom call now hushai the archite also and let u hear likewise what he saith and when hushai be come to absalom absalom spake unto him say ahithophel hath spoken after this manner shall we do after his say if not speak thou and hushai say unto absalom the counsel that ahithophel hath give be not good at this time for say hushai thou knowest thy father and his men that they be mighty men and they be chafed in their mind a bear robbed of her whelp in the field and thy father be man of war and will not lodge with the people behold he be hid now in some pit or in some other place and it will come to pas when some of them be overthrown at the first that whosoever heareth it will say there be slaughter among the people that follow absalom and he also that be valiant whose heart be a the heart of lion shall utterly melt for all israel knoweth that thy father be mighty man and they which be with him be valiant men therefore counsel that all israel be generally gather unto thee from dan even to beersheba a the sand that be by the sea for multitude and that thou go to battle in thine own person so shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found and we will light upon him a the dew falleth on the ground and of him and of all the men that be with him there shall not be left so much a one moreover if he be gotten into city then shall all israel bring rope to that city and we will draw it into the river until there be not one small stone found there and absalom and all the men of israel say the counsel of hushai the archite be well than the counsel of ahithophel for the lord have appoint to defeat the good counsel of ahithophel to the intent that the lord might bring evil upon absalom then say hushai unto zadok and to abiathar the priest thus and thus do ahithophel counsel absalom and the elder of israel and thus and thus have counsel now therefore send quickly and tell david say lodge not this night in the plain of the wilderness but speedily pas over l the king be swallow up and all the people that be with him now jonathan and ahimaaz stayed by enrogel for they might not be see to come into the city and wench go and told them and they go and told king david nevertheless lad saw them and told absalom but they go both of them away quickly and come to man house in bahurim which have well in his court whither they go down and the woman take and spread cover over the well mouth and spread ground corn thereon and the thing be not know and when absalom servant come to the woman to the house they say where be ahimaaz and jonathan and the woman say unto them they be go over the brook of water and when they have sought and could not find them they return to jerusalem and it come to pas after they be depart that they come up out of the well and go and told king david and say unto david arise and pas quickly over the water for thus hath ahithophel counsel against you then david arose and all the people that be with him and they pass over jordan by the morning light there lack not one of them that be not go over jordan and when ahithophel saw that his counsel be not follow he saddle his as and arose and gat him home to his house to his city and put his household in order and hang himself and die and be bury in the sepulchre of his father then david come to mahanaim and absalom pass over jordan he and all the men of israel with him and absalom make amasa captain of the host instead of joab which amasa be man son whose name be ithra an israelite that go in to abigail the daughter of nahash sister to zeruiah joab mother so israel and absalom pitch in the land of gilead and it come to pas when david be come to mahanaim that shobi the son of nahash of rabbah of the child of ammon and machir the son of ammiel of lodebar and barzillai the gileadite of rogelim brought bed and basons and earthen vessel and wheat and barley and flour and parch corn and bean and lentiles and parch pulse and honey and butter and sheep and cheese of kine for david and for the people that be with him to eat for they say the people be hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness and david numbered the people that be with him and set captain of thousand and captain of hundred over them and david sent forth third part of the people under the hand of joab and third part under the hand of abishai the son of zeruiah joab brother and third part under the hand of ittai the gittite and the king say unto the people will surely go forth with you myself also but the people answer thou shalt not go forth for if we flee away they will not care for u neither if half of u die will they care for u but now thou art worth ten thousand of u therefore now it be well that thou succour u out of the city and the king say unto them what seemeth you best will do and the king stood by the gate side and all the people come out by hundred and by thousand and the king command joab and abishai and ittai say deal gently for my sake with the young man even with absalom and all the people heard when the king give all the captain charge concern absalom so the people go out into the field against israel and the battle be in the wood of ephraim where the people of israel be slain before the servant of david and there be there great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men for the battle be there scatter over the face of all the country and the wood devour more people that day than the sword devour and absalom met the servant of david and absalom rode upon mule and the mule go under the thick bough of great oak and his head caught hold of the oak and he be take up between the heaven and the earth and the mule that be under him go away and certain man saw it and told joab and say behold saw absalom hang in an oak and joab say unto the man that told him and behold thou sawest him and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground and would have give thee ten shekel of silver and girdle and the man say unto joab though should receive thousand shekel of silver in mine hand yet would not put forth mine hand against the king son for in our hearing the king charge thee and abishai and ittai say beware that none touch the young man absalom otherwise should have wrought falsehood against mine own life for there be no matter hid from the king and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me then say joab may not tarry thus with thee and he take three dart in his hand and thrust them through the heart of absalom while he be yet alive in the midst of the oak and ten young men that bare joab armour compass about and smote absalom and slew him and joab blew the trumpet and the people return from pursue after israel for joab held back the people and they take absalom and cast him into great pit in the wood and laid very great heap of stone upon him and all israel flee every one to his tent now absalom in his lifetime have take and rear up for himself pillar which be in the king dale for he say have no son to keep my name in remembrance and he call the pillar after his own name and it be call unto this day absalom place then say ahimaaz the son of zadok let me now run and bear the king tidings how that the lord hath avenge him of his enemy and joab say unto him thou shalt not bear tidings this day but thou shalt bear tidings another day but this day thou shalt bear no tidings because the king son be dead then say joab to cushi go tell the king what thou hast see and cushi bow himself unto joab and ran then say ahimaaz the son of zadok yet again to joab but howsoever let me pray thee also run after cushi and joab say wherefore wilt thou run my son see that thou hast no tidings ready but howsoever say he let me run and he say unto him run then ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain and overran cushi and david sat between the two gate and the watchman go up to the roof over the gate unto the wall and lift up his eye and look and behold man run alone and the watchman cry and told the king and the king say if he be alone there be tidings in his mouth and he come apace and drew near and the watchman saw

the king say unto him why speakest thou any more of thy matter have say thou and ziba divide the land and mephibosheth say unto the king yea let him take all forasmuch a my lord the king be come again in peace unto his own house and barzillai the gileadite come down from rogelim and go over jordan with the king to conduct him over jordan now barzillai be very age man even fourscore year old and he

on to gilgal and chimham go on with him and all the people of judah conduct the king and also half the people of israel and behold all the men of israel come to the king and say unto the king why have our brother the men of judah steal thee away and have brought the king and his household and all david men with him over jordan and all the men of judah answer the men of israel because the king be near of kin to u wherefore then be ye angry for this matter have we eat at all of the king cost or hath he give u any gift and the men of israel answer the men of judah and say we have ten part in the king and we have also more right in david than ye why then do ye despise u that our advice should not be first have in bring back our king and the word of the men of judah be fiercer than the word of the men of israel and there happen to be there man of belial whose name be sheba the son of bichri benjamite and he blew trumpet and say we have no part in david neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse every man to his tent israel so every man of israel go up from after david and follow sheba the son of bichri but the men of judah clave unto their king from jordan even to jerusalem and david come to his house at jerusalem and the king take the ten woman his concubine whom he have left to keep the house and put them in ward and fed them but go not in unto them so they be shut up unto the day of their death living in widowhood then say the king to amasa assemble me the men of judah within three day and be thou here present so amasa go to assemble the men of judah but he tarry longer than the set time which he have appoint him and david say to abishai now shall sheba the son of bichri do u more harm than do absalom take thou thy lord servant and pursue after him l he get him fence city and escape u and there go out after him joab men and the cherethites and the pelethites and all the mighty men and they go out of jerusalem to pursue after sheba the son of bichri when they be at the great stone which be in gibeon amasa go before them and joab garment that he have put on be gird unto him and upon it girdle with sword fasten upon his loin in the sheath thereof and a he go forth it fell out and joab say to amasa art thou in health my brother and joab take amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him but amasa take no heed to the sword that be in joab hand so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib and shed out his bowel to the ground and struck him not again and he die so joab and abishai his brother pursue after sheba the son of bichri and one of joab men stood by him and say he that favoureth joab and he that be for david let him go after joab and amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway and when the man saw that all the people stood still he remove amasa out of the highway into the field and cast cloth upon him when he saw that every one that come by him stood still when he be remove out of the highway all the people go on after joab to pursue after sheba the son of bichri and he go through all the tribe of israel unto abel and to bethmaachah and all the berites and they be gather together and go also after him and they come and besiege him in abel of bethmaachah and they cast up bank against the city and it stood in the trench and all the people that be with joab batter the wall to throw it down then cry wise woman out of the city hear hear say pray you unto joab come near hither that may speak with thee and when he be come near unto her the woman say art thou joab and he answer be he then she say unto him hear the word of thine handmaid and he answer do hear then she spake say they be wont to speak in old time say they shall surely ask counsel at abel and so they end the matter be one of them that be peaceable and faithful in israel thou seekest to destroy city and mother in israel why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the lord and joab answer and say far be it far be it from me that should swallow up or destroy the matter be not so but man of mount ephraim sheba the son of bichri by name hath lift up his hand against the king even against david deliver him only and will depart from the city and the woman say unto joab behold his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall then the woman go unto all the people in her wisdom and they cut off the head of sheba the son of bichri and cast it out to joab and he blew trumpet and they retire from the city every man to his tent and joab return to jerusalem unto the king now joab be over all the host of israel and benaiah the son of jehoiada be over the cherethites and over the pelethites and adoram be over the tribute and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud be recorder and sheva be scribe and zadok and abiathar be the priest and ira also the jairite be chief ruler about david then there be famine in the day of david three year year after year and david enquire of the lord and the lord answer it be for saul and for his bloody house because he slew the gibeonites and the king call the gibeonites and say unto them now the gibeonites be not of the child of israel but of the remnant of the amorites and the child of israel have sworn unto them and saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the child of israel and judah wherefore david say unto the gibeonites what shall do for you and wherewith shall make the atonement that ye may bless the inheritance of the lord and the gibeonites say unto him we will have no silver nor gold of saul nor of his house neither for u shalt thou kill any man in israel and he say what ye shall say that will do for you and they answer the king the man that consume u and that devise against u that we should be destroyed from remain in any of the coast of israel let seven men of his son be deliver unto u and we will hang them up unto the lord in gibeah of saul whom the lord do choose and the king say will give them but the king spar mephibosheth the son of jonathan the son of saul because of the lord oath that be between them between david and jonathan the son of saul but the king take the two son of rizpah the daughter of aiah whom she bare unto saul armoni and mephibosheth and the five son of michal the daughter of saul whom she brought up for adriel the son of barzillai the meholathite and he deliver them into the hand of the gibeonites and they hang them in the hill before the lord and they fell all seven together and be put to death in the day of harvest in the first day in the begin of barley harvest and rizpah the daughter of aiah take sackcloth and spread it for her upon the rock from the begin of harvest until water drop upon them out of heaven and suffer neither the bird of the air to rest on them by day nor the beast of the field by night and it be told david what rizpah the daughter of aiah the concubine of saul have do and david go and take the bone of saul and the bone of jonathan his son from the men of jabeshgilead which have steal them from the street of bethshan where the philistine have hang them when the philistine have slain saul in gilboa and he brought up from thence the bone of saul and the bone of jonathan his son and they gather the bone of them that be hang and the bone of saul and jonathan his son bury they in the country of benjamin in zelah in the sepulchre of kish his father and they perform all that the king command and after that god be intreated for the land moreover the philistine have yet war again with israel and david go down and his servant with him and fought against the philistine and david waxed faint and ishbibenob which be of the son of the giant the weight of whose spear weigh three hundred shekel of brass in weight he be gird with new sword thought to have slain david but abishai the son of zeruiah succour him and smote the philistine and kill him then the men of david sware unto him say thou shalt go no more out with u to battle that thou quench not the light of israel and it come to pas after this that there be again battle with the philistine at gob then sibbechai the hushathite slew saph which be of the son of the giant and there be again battle in gob with the philistine where elhanan the son of jaareoregim bethlehemite slew the brother of goliath the gittite the staff of whose spear be like weaver beam and there be yet battle in gath where be man of great stature that have on every

born to the giant in gath and fell by the hand of david and by the hand of his servant and david spake unto the lord the word of this song in the day that the lord have deliver him out of the hand of all his enemy and out of the hand of saul and he say the lord be my rock and my fortress and my deliverer the god of my rock in him will trust he be my shield and the horn of my salvation my high

everlasting covenant order in all thing and sure for this be all my salvation and all my desire although he make it not to grow but the son of belial shall be all of them a thorn thrust away because they cannot be take with hand but the man that shall touch them must be fence with iron and the staff of spear and they shall be utterly burn with fire in the same place these be the name of the mighty men whom david have the tachmonite that sat in the seat chief among the captain the same be adino the eznite he lift up his spear against eight hundred whom he slew at one time and after him be eleazar the son of dodo the ahohite one of the three mighty men with david when they defy the philistine that be there gather together to battle and the men of israel be go away he arose and smote the philistine until his hand be weary and his hand clave unto the sword and the lord wrought great victory that day and the people return after him only to spoil and after him be shammah the son of agee the hararite and the philistine be gather together into troop where be piece of ground full of lentiles and the people flee from the philistine but he stood in the midst of the ground and defend it and slew the philistine and the lord wrought great victory and three of the thirty chief go down and come to david in the harvest time unto the cave of adullam and the troop of the philistine pitch in the valley of rephaim and david be then in an hold and the garrison of the philistine be then in bethlehem and david long and say oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of bethlehem which be by the gate and the three mighty men brake through the host of the philistine and drew water out of the well of bethlehem that be by the gate and take it and brought it to david nevertheless he would not drink thereof but pour it out unto the lord and he say be it far from me lord that should do this be not this the blood of the men that go in jeopardy of their life therefore he would not drink it these thing do these three mighty men and abishai the brother of joab the son of zeruiah be chief among three and he lift up his spear against three hundred and slew them and have the name among three be he not most honourable of three therefore he be their captain howbeit he attain not unto the first three and benaiah the son of jehoiada the son of valiant man of kabzeel who have do many act he slew two lionlike men of moab he go down also and slew lion in the midst of pit in time of snow and he slew an egyptian goodly man and the egyptian have spear in his hand but he go down to him with staff and plucked the spear out of the egyptian hand and slew him with his own spear these thing do benaiah the son of jehoiada and have the name among three mighty men he be more honourable than the thirty but he attain not to the first three and david set him over his guard asahel the brother of joab be one of the thirty elhanan the son of dodo of bethlehem shammah the harodite elika the harodite helez the paltite ira the son of ikkesh the tekoite abiezer the anethothite mebunnai the hushathite zalmon the ahohite maharai the netophathite heleb the son of baanah netophathite ittai the son of ribai out of gibeah of the child of benjamin benaiah the pirathonite hiddai of the brook of gaash abialbon the arbathite azmaveth the barhumite eliahba the shaalbonite of the son of jashen jonathan shammah the hararite ahiam the son of sharar the hararite eliphelet the son of ahasbai the son of the maachathite eliam the son of ahithophel the gilonite hezrai the carmelite paarai the arbite igal the son of nathan of zobah ban the gadite zelek the ammonite nahari the beerothite armourbearer to joab the son of zeruiah ira an ithrite gareb an ithrite uriah the hittite thirty and seven in all and again the anger of the lord be kindle against israel and he move david against them to say go number israel and judah for the king say to joab the captain of the host which be with him go now through all the tribe of israel from dan even to beersheba and number ye the people that may know the number of the people and joab say unto the king now the lord thy god add unto the people how many soever they be an hundredfold and that the eye of my lord the king may see it but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing notwithstanding the king word prevail against joab and against the captain of the host and joab and the captain of the host go out from the presence of the king to number the people of israel and they pass over jordan and pitch in aroer on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of gad and toward jazer then they come to gilead and to the land of tahtimhodshi and they come to danjaan and about to zidon and come to the strong hold of tyre and to all the city of the hivites and of the canaanite and they go out to the south of judah even to beersheba so when they have go through all the land they come to jerusalem at the end of nine month and twenty day and joab give up the sum of the number of the people unto the king and there be in israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword and the men of judah be five hundred thousand men and david heart smote him after that he have numbered the people and david say unto the lord have sin greatly in that have do and now beseech thee lord take away the iniquity of thy servant for have do very foolishly for when david be up in the morning the word of the lord come unto the prophet gad david seer say go and say unto david thus saith the lord offer thee three thing choose thee one of them that may do it unto thee so gad come to david and told him and say unto him shall seven year of famine come unto thee in thy land or wilt thou flee three month before thine enemy while they pursue thee or that there be three day pestilence in thy land now advise and see what answer shall return to him that sent me and david say unto gad be in great strait let u fall now into the hand of the lord for his mercy be great and let me not fall into the hand of man so the lord sent pestilence upon israel from the morning even to the time appoint and there die of the people from dan even to beersheba seventy thousand men and when the angel stretch out his hand upon jerusalem to destroy it the lord repent him of the evil and say to the angel that destroyed the people it be enough stay now thine hand and the angel of the lord be by the threshingplace of araunah the jebusite and david spake unto the lord when he saw the angel that smote the people and say lo have sin and have do wickedly but these sheep what have they do let thine hand pray thee be against me and against my father house and gad come that day to david and say unto him go up rear an altar unto the lord in the threshingfloor of araunah the jebusite and david accord to the say of gad go up a the lord command and araunah look and saw the king and his servant come on toward him and araunah go out and bow himself before the king on his face upon the ground and araunah say wherefore be my lord the king come to his servant and david say to buy the threshingfloor of thee to build an altar unto the lord that the plague may be stayed from the people and araunah say unto david let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him behold here be ox for burnt sacrifice and thresh instrument and other instrument of the ox for wood all these thing do araunah a king give unto the king and araunah say unto the king the lord thy god accept thee and the king say unto araunah nay but will surely buy it of thee at price neither will offer burnt offering unto the lord my god of that which doth cost me nothing so david bought the threshingfloor and the ox for fifty shekel of silver and david built there an altar unto the lord and offer burnt offering and peace offering so the lord be intreated for the land and the plague be stayed from israel book king now king david be old and stricken in year and they cover him with clothes but he gat no heat wherefore his servant say unto him let there be sought for my lord the king young virgin and let her stand before the king and let her cherish him and let her lie in thy bosom that my lord the king may get heat so they sought for fair damsel throughout all the coast of israel and found abishag shunammite and brought her to the king and the damsel be very fair and cherished the king and minister to him but the king knew her not then adonijah the son of haggith exalt himself say will be king and he prepared him chariot and horseman and fifty men to run before him and his father have not displeased him at any time in say why hast thou do so and he also be very goodly man and his mother bare him after absalom and he confer with joab the son of zeruiah and with abiathar the priest and they follow adonijah help him but zadok the priest and benaiah the son of jehoiada and nathan the prophet and shimei and rei and the mighty men which belong to david be not with adonijah and adonijah slew sheep and ox and fat cattle by the stone of zoheleth which be by enrogel and call all his brother the king son and all the men of judah the king servant but nathan the prophet and benaiah and the mighty men and solomon his brother he call not wherefore nathan spake unto bathsheba the mother of solomon say hast thou not heard that adonijah the son of haggith doth reign and david our lord knoweth it not now therefore come let me pray thee give thee counsel that thou mayest save thine own life and the life of thy son solomon go and get thee in unto king david and say unto him didst not thou my lord king swear unto thine handmaid say assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne why then doth adonijah reign behold while thou yet talkest there with the king also will come in after thee and confirm thy word and bathsheba go in unto the king into the chamber and the king be very old and abishag the shunammite minister unto the king and bathsheba bow and do obeisance unto the king and the king say what wouldest thou and she say unto him my lord thou swarest by the lord thy god unto thine handmaid say assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne and now behold adonijah reigneth and now my lord the king thou knowest it not and he hath slain ox and fat cattle and sheep in abundance and hath call all the son of the king and abiathar the priest and joab the captain of the host but solomon thy servant hath he not call and thou my lord king the eye of all israel be upon thee that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him otherwise it shall come to pas when my lord the king shall sleep with his father that and my son solomon shall be count offender and lo while she yet talk with the king nathan the prophet also come in and they told the king say behold nathan the prophet and when he be come in before the king he bow himself before the king with his face to the ground and nathan say my lord king hast thou say adonijah shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne for he be go down this day and hath slain ox and fat cattle and sheep in abundance and hath call all the king son and the captain of the host and abiathar the priest and behold they eat and drink before him and say god save king adonijah but me even me thy servant and zadok the priest and benaiah the son of jehoiada and thy servant solomon hath he not call be this thing do by my lord the king and thou hast not shew it unto thy servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him then king david answer and say call me bathsheba and she come into the king presence and stood before the king and the king sware and say a the lord liveth that hath redeem my soul out of all distress even a sware unto thee by the lord god of israel say assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead even so will certainly do this day then bathsheba bow with her face to the earth and do reverence to the king and say let my lord king david live for ever and king david say call me zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and they come before the king the king also say unto them take with you the servant of your lord and cause solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule and bring him down to gihon and let zadok the priest and nathan the prophet anoint him there king over israel and blow ye with the trumpet and say god save king solomon then ye shall come up after him that he may come and sit upon my throne for he shall be king in my stead and have appoint him to be ruler over israel and over judah and benaiah the son of jehoiada answer the king and say amen the lord god of my lord the king say so too a the lord hath be with my lord the king even so be he with solomon and make his throne great than the throne of my lord king david so zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and the cherethites and the pelethites go down and cause solomon to ride upon king david mule and brought him to gihon and zadok the priest take an horn of oil out of the tabernacle and anoint solomon and they blew the trumpet and all the people say god save king solomon and all the people come up after him and the

for him and for abiathar the priest and for joab the son of zeruiah then king solomon sware by the lord say god do so to me and more also if adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life now therefore a the lord liveth which hath establish me and set me on the throne of david my father and who hath make me an house a he promise adonijah shall be put to death this day and king solomon sent by the hand of benaiah the son of jehoiada and he fell upon him that he die and unto abiathar the priest say the king get thee to anathoth unto thine own field for thou art worthy of death but will not at this time put thee to death because thou barest the ark of the lord god before david my father and because thou hast be afflict in all wherein my father be afflict so solomon thrust out abiathar from be priest unto the lord that he might fulfil the word of the lord which he spake concern the house of eli in shiloh then tidings come to joab for joab have turn after adonijah though he turn not after absalom and joab flee unto the tabernacle of the lord and caught hold on the horn of the altar and it be told king solomon that joab be flee unto the tabernacle of the lord and behold

jehoiada go up and fell upon him and slew him and he be bury in his own house in the wilderness and the king put benaiah the son of jehoiada in his room over the host and zadok the priest do the king put in the room of abiathar and the king sent and call for shimei and say unto him build thee an house in jerusalem and dwell there and go not forth thence any whither for it shall be that on the day

they call for unto thee for thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth to be thine inheritance a thou spakest by the hand of moses thy servant when thou broughtest our father out of egypt lord god and it be so that when solomon have make an end of pray all this prayer and supplication unto the lord he arose from before the altar of the lord from kneel on his knee with his hand spread up to heaven and he stood and bless all the congregation of israel with loud voice say bless be the lord that hath give rest unto his people israel accord to all that he promise there hath not fail one word of all his good promise which he promise by the hand of moses his servant the lord our god be with u a he be with our father let him not leave u nor forsake u that he may incline our heart unto him to walk in all his way and to keep his commandment and his statute and his judgment which he command our father and let these my word wherewith have make supplication before the lord be nigh unto the lord our god day and night that he maintain the cause of his servant and the cause of his people israel at all time a the matter shall require that all the people of the earth may know that the lord be god and that there be none else let your heart therefore be perfect with the lord our god to walk in his statute and to keep his commandment a at this day and the king and all israel with him offer sacrifice before the lord and solomon offer sacrifice of peace offering which he offer unto the lord two and twenty thousand ox and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep so the king and all the child of israel dedicate the house of the lord the same day do the king hallow the middle of the court that be before the house of the lord for there he offer burnt offering and meat offering and the fat of the peace offering because the brasen altar that be before the lord be too little to receive the burnt offering and meat offering and the fat of the peace offering and at that time solomon held feast and all israel with him great congregation from the enter in of hamath unto the river of egypt before the lord our god seven day and seven day even fourteen day on the eighth day he sent the people away and they bless the king and go unto their tent joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the lord have do for david his servant and for israel his people and it come to pas when solomon have finish the building of the house of the lord and the king house and all solomon desire which he be pleased to do that the lord appear to solomon the second time a he have appear unto him at gibeon and the lord say unto him have heard thy prayer and thy supplication that thou hast make before me have hallow this house which thou hast built to put my name there for ever and mine eye and mine heart shall be there perpetually and if thou wilt walk before me a david thy father walk in integrity of heart and in uprightness to do accord to all that have command thee and wilt keep my statute and my judgment then will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon israel for ever a promise to david thy father say there shall not fail thee man upon the throne of israel but if ye shall at all turn from follow me ye or your child and will not keep my commandment and my statute which have set before you but go and serve other god and worship them then will cut off israel out of the land which have give them and this house which have hallow for my name will cast out of my sight and israel shall be proverb and byword among all people and at this house which be high every one that passeth by it shall be astonish and shall hiss and they shall say why hath the lord do thus unto this land and to this house and they shall answer because they forsook the lord their god who brought forth their father out of the land of egypt and have take hold upon other god and have worship them and serve them therefore hath the lord brought upon them all this evil and it come to pas at the end of twenty year when solomon have built the two house the house of the lord and the king house now hiram the king of tyre have furnish solomon with cedar tree and fir tree and with gold accord to all his desire that then king solomon give hiram twenty city in the land of galilee and hiram come out from tyre to see the city which solomon have give him and they pleased him not and he say what city be these which thou hast give me my brother and he call them the land of cabul unto this day and hiram sent to the king sixscore talent of gold and this be the reason of the levy which king solomon raise for to build the house of the lord and his own house and millo and the wall of jerusalem and hazor and megiddo and gezer for pharaoh king of egypt have go up and take gezer and burnt it with fire and slain the canaanite that dwelt in the city and give it for present unto his daughter solomon wife and solomon built gezer and bethhoron the nether and baalath and tadmor in the wilderness in the land and all the city of store that solomon have and city for his chariot and city for his horseman and that which solomon desire to build in jerusalem and in lebanon and in all the land of his dominion and all the people that be left of the amorites hittite perizzites hivites and jebusites which be not of the child of israel their child that be left after them in the land whom the child of israel also be not able utterly to destroy upon those do solomon levy tribute of bondservice unto this day but of the child of israel do solomon make no bondman but they be men of war and his servant and his prince and his captain and ruler of his chariot and his horseman these be the chief of the officer that be over solomon work five hundred and fifty which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work but pharaoh daughter come up out of the city of david unto her house which solomon have built for her then do he build millo and three time in year do solomon offer burnt offering and peace offering upon the altar which he built unto the lord and he burnt incense upon the altar that be before the lord so he finish the house and king solomon make navy of ship in eziongeber which be beside eloth on the shore of the red sea in the land of edom and hiram sent in the navy his servant shipmen that have knowledge of the sea with the servant of solomon and they come to ophir and fetch from thence gold four hundred and twenty talent and brought it to king solomon and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon concern the name of the lord she come to prove him with hard question and she come to jerusalem with very great train with camel that bare spice and very much gold and precious stone and when she be come to solomon she commune with him of all that be in her heart and solomon told her all her question there be not any thing hid from the king which he told her not and when the queen of sheba have see all solomon wisdom and the house that he have built and the meat of his table and the sit of his servant and the attendance of his minister and their apparel and his cupbearer and his ascent by which he go up unto the house of the lord there be no more spirit in her and she say to the king it be true report that heard in mine own land of thy act and of thy wisdom howbeit believe not the word until come and mine eye have see it and behold the half be not told me thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which heard happy be thy men happy be these thy servant which stand continually before thee and that hear thy wisdom bless be the lord thy god which delighted in thee to set thee on the throne of israel because the lord love israel for ever therefore make he thee king to do judgment and justice and she give the king an hundred and twenty talent of gold and of spice very great store and precious stone there come no more such abundance of spice a these which the queen of sheba give to king solomon and the navy also of hiram that brought gold from ophir brought in from ophir great plenty of almug tree and precious stone and the king make of the almug tree pillar for the house of the lord and for the king house harp also and psaltery for singer there come no such almug tree nor be see unto this day and king solomon give unto the queen of sheba all her desire whatsoever she ask beside that which solomon give her of his royal bounty so she turn and go to her own country she and her servant now the weight of gold that come to solomon in one year be six hundred threescore and six talent of gold beside that he have of the merchantman and of the traffick of the spice merchant and of all the king of arabia and of the governor of the country and king solomon make two hundred target of beaten gold six hundred

vessel of the house of the forest of lebanon be of pure gold none be of silver it be nothing account of in the day of solomon for the king have at sea navy of tharshish with the navy of hiram once in three year come the navy of tharshish bring gold and silver ivory and ape and peacock so king solomon exceed all the king of the earth for rich and for wisdom and all the earth sought to solomon to hear his wisdom which god have put in his heart and they brought every man his present vessel of silver and vessel of gold and garment and armour and spice horse and mule rate year by year and solomon gather together chariot and horseman and he have thousand and four hundred chariot and twelve thousand horseman whom he bestow in the city for chariot and with the king at jerusalem and the king make silver to be in jerusalem a stone and cedar make he to be a the sycomore tree that be in the vale for abundance and solomon have horse brought out of egypt and linen yarn the king merchant receive the linen yarn at price and chariot come up and go out of egypt for six hundred shekel of silver and an horse for an hundred and fifty and so for all the king of the hittite and for the king of syria do they bring them out by their mean but king solomon love many strange woman together with the daughter of pharaoh woman of the moabites ammonite edomites zidonians and hittite of the nation concern which the lord say unto the child of israel ye shall not go in to them neither shall they come in unto you for surely they will turn away your heart after their god solomon clave unto these in love and he have seven hundred wife princess and three hundred concubine and his wife turn away his heart for it come to pas when solomon be old that his wife turn away his heart after other god and his heart be not perfect with the lord his god a be the heart of david his father for solomon go after ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians and after milcom the abomination of the ammonite and solomon do evil in the sight of the lord and go not fully after the lord a do david his father then do solomon build an high place for chemosh the abomination of moab in the hill that be before jerusalem and for molech the abomination of the child of ammon and likewise do he for all his strange wife which burnt incense and sacrifice unto their god and the lord be angry with solomon because his heart be turn from the lord god of israel which have appear unto him twice and have command him concern this thing that he should not go after other god but he kept not that which the lord command wherefore the lord say unto solomon forasmuch a this be do of thee and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statute which have command thee will surely rend the kingdom from thee and will give it to thy servant notwithstanding in thy day will not do it for david thy father sake but will rend it out of the hand of thy son howbeit will not rend away all the kingdom but will give one tribe to thy son for david my servant sake and for jerusalem sake which have chosen and the lord stir up an adversary unto solomon hadad the edomite he be of the king seed in edom for it come to pas when david be in edom and joab the captain of the host be go up to bury the slain after he have smitten every male in edom for six month do joab remain there with all israel until he have cut off every male in edom that hadad flee he and certain edomites of his father servant with him to go into egypt hadad be yet little child and they arose out of midian and come to paran and they take men with them out of paran and they come to egypt unto pharaoh king of egypt which give him an house and appoint him victual and give him land and hadad found great favour in the sight of pharaoh so that he give him to wife the sister of his own wife the sister of tahpenes the queen and the sister of tahpenes bare him genubath his son whom tahpenes wean in pharaoh house and genubath be in pharaoh household among the son of pharaoh and when hadad heard in egypt that david slept with his father and that joab the captain of the host be dead hadad say to pharaoh let me depart that may go to mine own country then pharaoh say unto him but what hast thou lack with me that behold thou seekest to go to thine own country and he answer nothing howbeit let me go in any wise and god stir him up another adversary rezon the son of eliadah which flee from his lord hadadezer king of zobah and he gather men unto him and become captain over band when david slew them of zobah and they go to damascus and dwelt therein and reign in damascus and he be an adversary to israel all the day of solomon beside the mischief that hadad do and he abhor israel and reign over syria and jeroboam the son of nebat an ephrathite of zereda solomon servant whose mother name be zeruah widow woman even he lift up his hand against the king and this be the cause that he lift up his hand against the king solomon built millo and repair the breach of the city of david his father and the man jeroboam be mighty man of valour and solomon see the young man that he be industrious he make him ruler over all the charge of the house of joseph and it come to pas at that time when jeroboam go out of jerusalem that the prophet ahijah the shilonite found him in the way and he have clad himself with new garment and they two be alone in the field and ahijah caught the new garment that be on him and rent it in twelve piece and he say to jeroboam take thee ten piece for thus saith the lord the god of israel behold will rend the kingdom out of the hand of solomon and will give ten tribe to thee but he shall have one tribe for my servant david sake and for jerusalem sake the city which have chosen out of all the tribe of israel because that they have forsaken me and have worship ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians chemosh the god of the moabites and milcom the god of the child of ammon and have not walk in my way to do that which be right in mine eye and to keep my statute and my judgment a do david his father howbeit will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand but will make him prince all the day of his life for david my servant sake whom chose because he kept my commandment and my statute but will take the kingdom out of his son hand and will give it unto thee even ten tribe and unto his son will give one tribe that david my servant may have light alway before me in jerusalem the city which have chosen me to put my name there and will take thee and thou shalt reign accord to all that thy soul desireth and shalt be king over israel and it shall be if thou wilt hearken unto all that command thee and wilt walk in my way and do that be right in my sight to keep my statute and my commandment a david my servant do that will be with thee and build thee sure house a built for david and will give israel unto thee and will for this afflict the seed of david but not for ever solomon sought therefore to kill jeroboam and jeroboam arose and flee into egypt unto shishak king of egypt and be in egypt until the death of solomon and the rest of the act of solomon and all that he do and his wisdom be they not write in the book of the act of solomon and the time that solomon reign in jerusalem over all israel be forty year and solomon slept with his father and be bury in the city of david his father and rehoboam his son reign in his stead and rehoboam go to shechem for all israel be come to shechem to make him king and it come to pas when jeroboam the son of nebat who be yet in egypt heard of it for he be flee from the presence of king solomon and jeroboam dwelt in egypt that they sent and call him and jeroboam and all the congregation of israel come and spake unto rehoboam say thy father make our yoke grievous now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father and his heavy yoke which he put upon u lighter and we will serve thee and he say unto them depart yet for three day then come again to me and the people depart and king rehoboam consult with the old men that stood before solomon his father while he yet live and say how do ye advise that may answer this people and they spake unto him say if thou wilt be servant unto this people this day and wilt serve them and answer them and speak good word to them then they will be thy servant for ever but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they have give him and consult with the young men that be grown up with him and which stood before him and he say unto them what counsel give ye that we may answer this people who have spoken to me say make the yoke which thy father do put upon u lighter and the young men that be grown up with him spake unto him say thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee say thy father make our yoke heavy but make thou it lighter unto u thus shalt thou say unto them my little finger shall be thicker than my father loin and now whereas my father do lade you with heavy yoke will add to your yoke my father hath chastise you with whip but will chastise you with scorpion so jeroboam and all the people come to rehoboam the third day a the king have appoint say come to me again the third day and the king answer the people roughly and forsook the old men counsel that they give him and spake to them after the counsel of the young men say my father make your yoke heavy and will add to your yoke my father also chastise you with whip but will chastise you with scorpion wherefore the king hearken not unto the people for the cause be from the lord that he might perform his say which the lord spake by ahijah the shilonite unto jeroboam the son of nebat so when all israel saw that the king hearken not unto them the people answer the king say what portion have we in david neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse to your tent israel now see to thine own house david so israel depart unto their tent but a for the child of israel which dwelt in the city of judah rehoboam reign over them then king rehoboam sent adoram who be over the tribute and all israel stone him with stone that he die therefore king rehoboam make speed to get him up to his chariot to flee to jerusalem so israel rebel against the house of david unto this day and it come to pas when all israel heard that jeroboam be come again that they sent and call him unto the congregation and make him king over all israel there be none that follow the house of david but the tribe of judah only and when rehoboam be come to jerusalem he assemble all the house of judah with the tribe of benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men which be warrior to fight against the house of israel to bring the kingdom again to rehoboam the son of solomon but the word of god come unto shemaiah the man of god say speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and unto all the house of judah and benjamin and to the remnant of the people say thus saith the lord ye shall not go up nor fight against your brother the child of israel return every man to his house for this thing be from me they hearken therefore to the word of the lord and return to depart accord to the word of the lord then jeroboam built shechem in mount ephraim and dwelt therein and go out from thence and built penuel and jeroboam say in his heart now shall the kingdom return to the house of david if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the lord at jerusalem then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord even unto rehoboam king of judah and they shall kill me and go again to rehoboam king of judah whereupon the king take counsel and make two calf of gold and say unto them it be too much for you to go up to jerusalem behold thy god israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt and he set the one in bethel and the other put he in dan and this thing become sin for the people go to worship before the one even unto dan and he make an house of high place and make priest of the low of the people which be not of the son of levi and jeroboam ordain feast in the eighth month on the fifteenth day of the month like unto the feast that be in judah and he offer upon the altar so do he in bethel sacrifice unto the calf that he have make and he place in bethel the priest of the high place which he have make so he offer upon the altar which he have make in bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month even in the month which he have devise of his own heart and ordain feast unto the child of israel and he offer upon the altar and burnt incense and behold there come man of god out of judah by the word of the lord unto bethel and jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense and he cry against the altar in the word of the lord and say altar altar thus saith the lord behold child shall be born unto the house of david josiah by name and upon thee shall he offer the priest of the high place that burn incense upon thee and men bone shall be burnt upon thee and he give sign the same day say this be the sign which the lord hath spoken behold the altar shall be rent and the ash that be upon it shall be pour out and it come to pas when king jeroboam heard the say of the man of god which have cry against the altar in bethel that he put forth his hand from the altar say lay hold on him and his hand which he put forth against him dry up so that he could not pull it in again to him the altar also be rent and the ash pour out from the altar accord to the sign which the man of god have give by the word of the lord and the king answer and say unto the man of god intreat now the face of the lord thy god and pray for me that my hand may be restore me again and the man of god besought the lord and the king hand be restore him again and become a it be before and the king say unto the man of god come home with me and refresh thyself and will give thee reward and the man of god say unto the king if thou wilt give me half thine house will not go in with thee neither will eat bread nor drink water in this place for so be it charge me by the word of the lord say eat no bread nor drink water nor turn again by the same way that thou camest so he go another way and return not by the way that he come to bethel now there dwelt an old prophet in bethel and his son come and told him all the work that the man of god have do that day in bethel the word which he have spoken unto the king them they told also to their father and their father say unto them what way go he for his son have see what way the man of god go which come from judah and he say unto his son saddle me the as so they saddle him the as and he rode thereon and go after the man of god and found him sit under an oak and he say unto him art thou the man of god that camest from judah and he say be then he say unto him come home with me and eat bread and he say may not return with thee nor go in with thee neither will eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place for it be say to me by the word of the lord thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest he say unto him be prophet also a thou art and an angel spake unto me by the word of the lord say bring him back with thee into thine house that he may eat bread and drink water but he lie unto him so he go back with him and do eat bread in his house and drank water and it come to pas a they sat at the table that the word of the lord come unto the prophet that brought him back and he cry unto the man of god that come from judah say thus saith the lord forasmuch a thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the lord and hast not kept the commandment which the lord thy god command thee but camest back and hast eat bread and drunk water in the place of the which the lord do say to thee eat no bread and drink no water thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy father and it come to pas after he have eat bread and after he have drunk that he saddle for him the as to wit for the prophet whom he have brought back and when he be go lion met him by the way and slew him and his carcase be cast in the way and the as stood by it the lion also stood by the carcase and behold men pass by and saw the carcase cast in the way and the lion stand by the carcase and they come and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt and when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof he say it be the man of god who be disobedient unto the word of the lord therefore the lord hath deliver him unto the lion which hath torn him and slain him accord to the word of the lord which he spake unto him and he spake to his son say saddle me the as and they saddle him and he go and found his carcase cast in the way and the as and the lion stand by the carcase the lion have not eat the carcase nor torn the as and the prophet take up the carcase of the man of god and laid it upon the as and brought it back and the old prophet come to the city to mourn and to bury him and he laid his carcase in his own grave and they mourn over him say ala my brother and it come to pas after he have bury him that he spake to his son say when be dead then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of god be bury lay my bone beside his bone for the say which he cry by the word of the lord against the altar in bethel and against all the house of the high place which be in the city of samaria shall surely come to pas after this thing jeroboam return not from his evil way but make again of the low of the people priest of the high place whosoever would he consecrate him and he become one of the priest of the high place and this thing become sin unto the house of jeroboam even to cut it off and to destroy it from off the face of the earth at that time abijah the son of jeroboam fell sick and jeroboam say to his wife arise pray thee and disguise thyself that thou be not know to be the wife of jeroboam and get thee to shiloh behold there be ahijah the prophet which told me that should be king over this people and take with thee ten loaf and cracknels and cruse of honey and go to him he shall tell thee what shall become of the child and jeroboam wife do so and arose and go to shiloh and come to the house of ahijah but ahijah could not see for his eye be set by reason of his age and the lord say unto ahijah behold the wife of jeroboam cometh to ask thing of thee for her son for he be sick thus and thus shalt thou say unto her for it shall be when she cometh in that she shall feign herself to be another woman and it be so when ahijah heard the sound of her foot a she come in at the door that he say come in thou wife of jeroboam why feignest thou thyself to be another for be sent to thee with heavy tidings go tell jeroboam thus saith the lord god of israel forasmuch a exalt thee from among the people and make thee prince over my people israel and rent the kingdom away from the house of david and give it thee and yet thou hast not be a my servant david who kept my commandment and who follow me with all his heart to do that only which be right in mine eye but hast do evil above all that be before thee for thou hast go and make thee other god and molten image to provoke me to anger and hast cast me behind thy back therefore behold will bring evil upon the house of jeroboam and will cut off from jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall and him that be shut up and left in israel and will take away the remnant of the house of jeroboam a man taketh away dung till it be all go him that dieth of jeroboam in the city shall the dog eat and him that dieth in the field shall the fowl of the air eat for the lord hath spoken it arise thou therefore get thee to thine own house and when thy foot enter into the city the child shall die and all israel shall mourn for him and bury him for he only of jeroboam shall come to the grave because in him there be found some good thing toward the lord god of israel in the house of jeroboam moreover the lord shall raise him up king over israel who shall cut off the house of jeroboam that day but what even now for the lord shall smite israel a reed be shaken in the water and he shall root up israel out of this good land which he give to their father and shall scatter them beyond the river because they have make their grove provoke the lord to anger and he shall give israel up because of the sin of jeroboam who do sin and who make israel to sin and jeroboam wife arose and depart and come to tirzah and when she come to the threshold of the door the child die and they bury him and all israel mourn for him accord to the word of the lord which he spake by the hand of his servant ahijah the prophet and the rest of the act of jeroboam how he war and how he reign behold they be write in the book of the chronicle of the king of israel and the day which jeroboam reign be two and twenty year and he slept with his father and nadab his son reign in his stead and rehoboam the son of solomon reign in judah rehoboam be forty and one year old when he begin to reign and he reign seventeen year in jerusalem the city which the lord do choose out of all the tribe of israel to put his name there and his mother name be naamah an ammonite and judah do evil in the sight of the lord and they provoke him to jealousy with their sin which they have commit above all that their father have do for they also built them high place and image and grove on every high hill and under every green tree and there be also sodomite in the land and they do accord to all the abomination of the nation

and say here be elisha the son of shaphat which pour water on the hand of elijah and jehoshaphat say the word of the lord be with him so the king of israel and jehoshaphat and the king of edom go down to him and elisha say unto the king of israel what have to do with thee get thee to the prophet of thy father and to the prophet of thy mother and the king of israel say unto him nay for the lord hath call these three king together to deliver them into the hand of moab and elisha say a the lord of host liveth before whom stand surely be it not that regard the presence of jehoshaphat the king of judah would not look toward thee nor see thee but now bring me minstrel and it come to pas when the minstrel played that the hand of the lord come upon him and he say thus saith the lord make this valley full of ditch for thus saith the lord ye shall not see wind neither shall ye see rain yet that valley shall be fill with water that ye may drink both ye and your cattle and your beast and this be but light thing in the sight of the lord he will deliver the moabites also into your hand and ye shall smite every fence city and every choice city and shall fell every good tree and stop all well of water and mar every good piece of land with stone and it come to pas in the morning when the meat offering be offer that behold there come water by the way of edom and the country be fill with water and when all the moabites heard that the king be come up to fight against them they gather all that be able to put on armour and upward and stood in the border and they rise up early in the morning and the sun shone upon the water and the moabites saw the water on the other side a red a blood and they say this be blood the king be surely slain and they have smitten one another now

country and they beat down the city and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone and fill it and they stop all the well of water and fell all the good tree only in kirharaseth left they the stone thereof howbeit the slinger go about it and smote it and when the king of moab saw that the battle be too sore for him he take with him seven hundred men that drew sword to break through even unto the king of edom but they could not then he take his eldest son that should have reign in his stead and offer him for burnt offering upon the wall and there be great indignation against israel and they depart from him and return to their own land now there cry certain woman of the wife of the son of the prophet unto elisha say thy servant my husband be dead and thou knowest that thy servant do fear the lord and the creditor be come to take unto him my two son to be bondman and elisha say unto her what shall do for thee tell me what hast thou in the house and she say thine

away and the man of god say let her alone for her soul be vexed within her and the lord hath hid it from me and hath not told me then she say do desire son of my lord do not say do not deceive me then he say to gehazi gird up thy loin and take my staff in thine hand and go thy way if thou meet any man salute him not and if any salute thee answer him not again and lay my staff upon the face of the child and the mother of the child say a the lord liveth and a thy soul liveth will not leave thee and he arose and follow her and gehazi pass on before them and laid the staff upon the face of the child but there be neither voice nor hearing wherefore he go again to meet him and told him say the child be not awaked and when elisha be come into the house behold the child be dead and laid upon his bed he go in therefore and shut the door upon them twain and prayed unto the lord and he go up and lay upon the child and put his mouth upon his mouth and his eye upon his eye and his hand upon his hand and stretch himself upon the child and the flesh of the child waxed warm then he return and walk in the house to and fro and go up and stretch himself upon him and the child sneeze seven time and the child open his eye and he call gehazi and say call this shunammite so he call her and when she be come in unto him he say take up thy son then she go in and fell at his foot and bow herself to

money and to receive garment and oliveyards and vineyard and sheep and ox and manservant and maidservant the leprosy therefore of naaman shall cleave unto thee and unto thy seed for ever and he go out from his presence leper a white a snow and the son of the prophet say unto elisha behold now the place where we dwell with thee be too strait for u let u go we pray thee unto jordan and take thence every man beam and let u make u place there where we may dwell and he answer go ye and one say be content pray thee and go with thy servant and he answer will go so he go with them and when they come to jordan they cut down wood but a one be fell beam the axe head fell into the water and he cry and say ala master for it be borrow and the man of god say where fell it and he shew him the place and he cut down stick and cast it in thither and the iron do swim therefore say he take it up to thee and he put out his hand and take it then the king of syria war against israel and take counsel with his servant say in such and such place shall be my camp and the man of god sent unto the king of israel say beware that thou pas not such place for thither the syrian be come down and the king of israel sent to the place which the man of god told him and warn him of and save himself there not once nor twice therefore the heart of the king of syria be sore troubled for this thing and he call his servant and say unto them will ye not shew me which of u be for the king of israel and one of his servant say none my lord king but elisha the prophet that be in israel telleth the king of israel the word that thou speakest in thy bedchamber and he say go and spy where he be that may send and fetch him and it be told him say behold he be in dothan therefore sent he thither horse and chariot and great host and they come by night and compass the city about and when the servant of the man of god be risen early and go forth behold an host compass the city both with horse and chariot and his servant say unto him ala my master how shall we do and he answer fear not for they that be with u be more than they that be with them and elisha prayed and say lord pray thee open his eye that he may see and the lord open the eye of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain be full of horse and chariot of fire round about elisha and when they come down to him elisha prayed unto the lord and say smite this people pray thee with blindness and he smote them with blindness accord to the word of elisha and elisha say unto them this be not the way neither be this the city follow me and will bring you to the man whom ye seek but he lead them to samaria and it come to pas when they be come into samaria that elisha say lord open the eye of these men that they may see and the lord open their eye and they saw and behold they be in the midst of samaria and the king of israel say unto elisha when he saw them my father shall smite them shall smite them and he answer thou shalt not smite them wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast take captive with thy sword and with thy bow set bread and water before them that they may eat and drink and go to their master and he prepared great provision for them and when they have eat and drunk he sent them away and they go to their master so the band of syria come no more into the land of israel and it come to pas after this that benhadad king of syria gather all his host and go up and besiege samaria and there be great famine in samaria and behold they besiege it until an as head be sell for fourscore piece of silver and the fourth part of cab of dove dung for five piece of silver and a the king of israel be passing by upon the wall there cry woman unto him say help my lord king and he say if the lord do not help thee whence shall help thee out of the barnfloor or out of the winepress and the king say unto her what aileth thee and she answer this woman say unto me give thy son that we may eat him to day and we will eat my son to morrow so we boil my son and do eat him and say unto her on the next day give thy son that we may eat him and she hath hid her son and it come to pas when the king heard the word of the woman that he rent his clothes and he pass by upon the wall and the people look and behold he have sackcloth within upon his flesh then he say god do so and more also to me if the head of elisha the son of shaphat shall stand on him this day but elisha sat in his house and the elder sat with him and the king sent man from before him but ere the messenger come to him he say to the elder see ye how this son of murderer hath sent to take away mine head look when the messenger cometh shut the door and hold him fast at the door be not the sound of his master foot behind him and while he yet talk with them behold the messenger come down unto him and he say behold this evil be of the lord what should wait for the lord any longer then elisha say hear ye the word of the lord thus saith the lord to morrow about this time shall measure of fine flour be sell for shekel and two measure of barley for shekel in the gate of samaria then lord on whose hand the king lean answer the man of god and say behold if

have brought them up out of the land of egypt from under the hand of pharaoh king of egypt and have fear other god and walk in the statute of the heathen whom the lord cast out from before the child of israel and of the king of israel which they have make and the child of israel do secretly those thing that be not right against the lord their god and they built them high place in all their city from the tower of the watchman to the fence city and they set them up image and grove in every high hill and under every green tree and there they burnt incense in all the high place a do the heathen whom the lord carry away before them and wrought wicked thing to provoke the lord to anger for they serve idol whereof the lord have say unto them ye shall not do this thing yet the lord testify against israel and against judah by all the prophet and by all the seer say turn ye from your evil way and keep my commandment and my statute accord to all the law which command your father and which sent to you by my servant the prophet notwithstanding they would not hear but harden their neck like to the neck of their father that do not believe in the lord their god and they reject his statute and his covenant that he make with their father and his testimony which he testify against them and they follow vanity and become vain and go after the heathen that be round about them concern whom the lord have charge them that they should not do like them and they left all the commandment of the lord their god and make them molten image even two calf and make grove and worship all the host of heaven and serve baal and they cause their son and their daughter to pas through the fire and use divination and enchantment and sell themselves to do evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him to

which he do they depart not from them until the lord remove israel out of his sight a he have say by all his servant the prophet so be israel carry away out of their own land to assyria unto this day and the king of assyria brought men from babylon and from cuthah and from ava and from hamath and from sepharvaim and place them in the city of samaria instead of the child of israel and they possess samaria and dwelt in the city thereof and so it be at the begin of their dwell there that they fear not the lord therefore the lord sent lion among them which slew some of them wherefore they spake to the king of assyria say the nation which thou hast remove and place in the city of samaria know not the manner of the god of the land therefore he hath sent lion among them and behold they slay them because they know not the manner of the god of the land then the king of assyria command say carry thither one of the priest whom ye brought from thence and let them go and dwell there and let him teach them the manner of the god of the land then one of the priest whom they have carry away from samaria come and dwelt in bethel and taught them how they should fear the lord howbeit every nation make god of their own and put them in the house of the high place which the samaritan have make every nation in their city wherein they dwelt and the men of babylon make succothbenoth and the men of cuth make nergal and the men of hamath make ashima and the avites make nibhaz and tartak and the sepharvites burnt their child in fire to adrammelech and anammelech the god of sepharvaim so they fear the lord and make unto themselves of the low of them priest of the high place which sacrifice for them in the house of the high place they fear the lord and serve their own god after the manner of the nation whom they carry away from thence unto this day they do after the former manner they fear not the lord neither do they after their statute or after their ordinance or after the law and commandment which the lord command the child of jacob whom he name israel with whom the lord have make covenant and charge them say ye shall not fear other god nor bow yourselves to them nor serve them nor sacrifice to them but the lord who brought you up out of the land of egypt with great power and stretch out arm him shall ye fear and him shall ye worship and to him shall ye do sacrifice and the statute and the ordinance and the law and the commandment which he write for you ye shall observe to do for evermore and ye shall not fear other god and the covenant that have make with you ye shall not forget neither shall ye fear other god but the lord your god ye shall fear and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemy howbeit they do not hearken but they do after their former manner so these nation fear the lord and serve their graven image both their child and their child child a do their father so do they unto this day now it come to pas in the third year of hoshea son of elah king of israel that hezekiah the son of ahaz king of judah begin to reign twenty and five year old be he when he begin to reign and he reign twenty and nine year in jerusalem his

unto them hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these word hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall that they may eat their own dung and drink their own piss with you then rabshakeh stood and cry with loud voice in the jew language and spake say hear the word of the great king the king of assyria thus saith the king let not hezekiah deceive you for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord say the lord will surely deliver u and this city shall not be deliver into the hand of the king of assyria hearken

lord be not afraid of the word which thou hast heard with which the servant of the king of assyria have blaspheme me behold will send blast upon him and he shall hear rumour and shall return to his

nathan the prophet lo dwell in an house of cedar but the ark of the covenant of the lord remaineth under curtain then nathan say unto david do all that be in thine heart for god be with thee and it come to pas the same night that the word of god come to nathan say go and tell david my servant thus saith the lord thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in for have not dwelt in an house since the day that brought up israel unto this day but have go from tent to tent and from one tabernacle to another wheresoever have walk with all israel spake word to any of the judge of israel whom

philistine and from amalek moreover abishai the son of zeruiah slew of the edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand and he put garrison in edom and all the edomites become david servant thus the lord preserve david whithersoever he go so david reign over all israel and execute judgment and justice among all his people and joab the son of zeruiah be over the host and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud recorder and zadok the son of ahitub and abimelech the son of abiathar be the priest and shavsha be scribe and benaiah the son of jehoiada be over the cherethites and the pelethites and the son of david be chief about the king now it come to pas after this that nahash the king of the child of ammon die and his son reign in his stead and david say will shew kindness unto hanun the son of nahash because his father shew kindness to me and david sent messenger to comfort him concern his father so the servant of david come into the land of the child of ammon to hanun to comfort him but the prince of the child of ammon say to hanun thinkest thou that david doth honour thy father that he hath sent comforter unto thee be not his servant come unto thee for to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land wherefore hanun take david servant and shave them and cut off their garment in the midst hard by their buttock and sent them away then there go certain and told david how the men be serve and he sent to meet them for the men be greatly ashamed and the king say tarry at jericho until your beard be grown and then return and when the child of ammon saw that they have make themselves odious to david hanun and the child of ammon sent thousand talent of silver to hire them chariot and horseman out of mesopotamia and out of syriamaachah and out of zobah so they hire thirty and two thousand chariot and the king of maachah and his people who come and pitch before medeba and the child of ammon gather themselves together from their city and come to battle and when david heard of it he sent joab and all the host of the mighty men and the child of ammon come out and put the battle in array before the gate of the city and the king that be come be by themselves in the field now when joab saw that the battle be set against him before and behind he chose out of all the choice of israel and put them in array against the syrian and the rest of the people he deliver unto the hand of abishai his brother and they set themselves in array against the child of ammon and he say if the syrian be too strong for me then thou shalt help me but if the child of ammon be too strong for thee then will help thee be of good courage and let u behave ourselves valiantly for our people and for the city of our god and let the lord do that which be good in his sight so joab and the people that be with him drew nigh before the syrian unto the battle and they flee before him and when the child of ammon saw that the syrian be flee they likewise flee before abishai his brother and enter into the city then joab come to jerusalem and when the syrian saw that they be put to the bad before israel they sent messenger and drew forth the syrian that be beyond the river and shophach the captain of the host of hadarezer go before them and it be told david and he gather all israel and pass over jordan and come upon them and set the battle in array against them so when david have put the battle in array against the syrian they fought with him but the syrian flee before israel and david slew of the syrian seven thousand men which fought in chariot and forty thousand footman and kill shophach the captain of the host and when the servant of hadarezer saw that they be put to the bad before israel they make peace with david and become his servant neither would the syrian help the child of ammon any more and it come to pas that after the year be expire at the time that king go out to battle joab lead forth the power of the army and waste the country of the child of ammon and come and besiege rabbah but david tarry at jerusalem and joab smote rabbah and destroyed it and david take the crown of their king from off his head and found it to weigh talent of gold and there be precious stone in it and it be set upon david head and he brought also exceed much spoil out of the city and he brought out the people that be in it and cut them with saw and with harrow of iron and with ax even so dealt david with all the city of the child of ammon and david and all the people return to jerusalem and it come to pas after this that there arose war at gezer with the philistine at which time sibbechai the hushathite slew sippai that be of the child of the giant and they be subdue and there be war again with the philistine and elhanan the son of jair slew lahmi the brother of goliath the gittite whose spear staff be like weaver beam and yet again there be war at gath where be man of great stature whose finger and toe be four and twenty six on each hand and six on each foot and he also be the son of the giant but when he defy israel jonathan the son of shimea david brother slew him these be born unto the giant in gath and they fell by the hand of david and by the hand of his servant and satan stood up against israel and provoke david to number israel and david say to joab and to the ruler of the people go number israel from beersheba even to dan and bring the number of them to me that may know it and joab answer the lord make his people an hundred time so many more a they be but my lord the king be they not all my lord servant why then doth my lord require this thing why will he be cause of trespass to israel nevertheless the king word prevail against joab wherefore joab depart and go throughout all israel and come to jerusalem and joab give the sum of the number of the people unto david and all they of israel be thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword and judah be four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword but levi and benjamin count he not among them for the king word be abominable to joab and god be displeased with this thing therefore he smote israel and david say unto god have sin greatly because have do this thing but now beseech thee do away the iniquity of thy servant for have do very foolishly and the lord spake unto gad david seer say go and tell david say thus saith the lord offer thee three thing choose thee one of them that may do it unto thee so gad come to david and say unto him thus saith the lord choose thee either three year famine or three month to be destroyed before thy foe while that the sword of thine enemy overtaketh thee or else three day the sword of the lord even the pestilence in the land and the angel of the lord destroy throughout all the coast of israel now therefore advise thyself what word shall bring again to him that sent me and david say unto gad be in great strait let me fall now into the hand of the lord for very great be his mercy but let me not fall into the hand of man so the lord sent pestilence upon israel and there fell of israel seventy thousand men and god sent an angel unto jerusalem to destroy it and a he be destroy the lord beheld and he repent him of the evil and say to the angel that destroyed it be enough stay now thine hand and the angel of the lord stood by the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite and david lift up his eye and saw the angel of the lord stand between the earth and the heaven have drawn sword in his hand stretch out over jerusalem then david and the elder of israel who be clothed in sackcloth fell upon their face and david say unto god be it not that command the people to be numbered even it be that have sin and do evil indeed but a for these sheep what have they do let thine hand pray thee lord my god be on me and on my father house but not on thy people that they should be plague then the angel of the lord command gad to say to david that david should go up and set up an altar unto the lord in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite and david go up at the say of gad which he spake in the name of the lord and ornan turn back and saw the angel and his four son with him hid themselves now ornan be thresh wheat and a david come to ornan ornan look and saw david and go out of the threshingfloor and bow himself to david with his face to the ground then david say to ornan grant me the place of this threshingfloor that may build an altar therein unto the lord thou shalt grant it me for the full price that the plague may be stayed from the people and ornan say unto david take it to thee and let my lord the king do that which be good in his eye lo give thee the ox also for burnt offering and the thresh instrument for wood and the wheat for the meat offering give it all and king david say to ornan nay but will verily buy it for the full price for will not take that which be thine for the lord nor offer burnt offering without cost so david give to ornan for the place six hundred shekel of gold by weight and david built there an altar unto the lord and offer burnt offering and peace offering and call upon the lord and he answer him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering and the lord command the angel and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof at that time when david saw that the lord have answer him in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite then he sacrifice there for the tabernacle of the lord which moses make in the wilderness and the altar of the burnt offering be at that season in the high place at gibeon but david could not go before it to enquire of god for he be afraid because of the sword of the angel of the lord then david say this be the house of the lord god and this be the altar of the burnt offering for israel and david command to gather together the stranger that be in the land of israel and he set mason to hew wrought stone to build the house of god and david prepared iron in abundance for the nail for the door of the gate and for the joining and brass in abundance without weight also cedar tree in abundance for the zidonians and they of tyre brought much cedar wood to david and david say

david prepared abundantly before his death then he call for solomon his son and charge him to build an house for the lord god of israel and david say to solomon my son a for me it be in my mind to build an house unto the name of the lord my god but the word of the lord come to me say thou hast shed blood abundantly and hast make great war thou shalt not build an house unto my name because thou

give peace and quietness unto israel in his day he shall build an house for my name and he shall be my son and will be his father and will establish the throne of his kingdom over israel for ever now

from the river even unto the land of the philistine and to the border of egypt and the king make silver in jerusalem a stone and cedar tree make he a the sycomore tree that be in the low plain in abundance and they brought unto solomon horse out of egypt and out of all land now the rest of the act of solomon first and last be they not write in the book of nathan the prophet and in the prophecy of ahijah the shilonite and in the vision of iddo the seer against jeroboam the son of nebat and solomon reign in jerusalem over all israel forty year and solomon slept with his father and he be bury in the city of david his father and rehoboam his son reign in his stead and rehoboam go to shechem for to shechem be all israel come to make him king and it come to pas when jeroboam the son of nebat who be in egypt whither he flee from the presence of solomon the king heard it that jeroboam return out of egypt and they sent and call him so jeroboam and all israel come and spake to rehoboam say thy father make our yoke grievous now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father and his heavy yoke that he put upon u and we will serve thee and he say unto them come again unto me after three day and the people depart and king rehoboam take counsel with the old men that have stood before solomon his father while he yet live say what counsel give ye me to return answer to this people and they spake unto him say if thou be kind to this people and please them and speak good word to them they will be thy servant for ever but he forsook the counsel which the old men give him and take counsel with the young men that be brought up with him that stood before him and he say unto them what advice give ye that we may return answer to this people which have spoken to me say ease somewhat the yoke that thy father do put upon u and the young men that be brought up with him spake unto him say thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee say thy father make our yoke heavy but make thou it somewhat lighter for u thus shalt thou say unto them my little finger shall be thicker than my father loin for whereas my father put heavy yoke upon you will put more to your yoke my father chastise you with whip but will chastise you with scorpion so jeroboam and all the people come to rehoboam on the third day a the king bade say come again to me on the third day and the king answer them roughly and king rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men and answer them after the advice of the young men say my father make your yoke heavy but will add thereto my father chastise you with whip but will chastise you with scorpion so the king hearken not unto the people for the cause be of god that the lord might perform his word which he spake by the hand of ahijah the shilonite to jeroboam the son of nebat and when all israel saw that the king would not hearken unto them the people answer the king say what portion have we in david and we have none inheritance in the son of jesse every man to your tent israel and now david see to thine own house so all israel go to their tent but a for the child of israel that dwelt in the city of judah rehoboam reign over them then king rehoboam sent hadoram that be over the tribute and the child of israel stone him with stone that he die but king rehoboam make speed to get him up to his chariot to flee to jerusalem and israel rebel against the house of david unto this day and when rehoboam be come to jerusalem he gather of the house of judah and benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men which be warrior to fight against israel that he might bring the kingdom again to rehoboam but the word of the lord come to shemaiah the man of god say speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and to all israel in judah and benjamin say thus saith the lord ye shall not go up nor fight against your brother return every man to his house for this thing be do of me and they obeyed the word of the lord and return from go against jeroboam and rehoboam dwelt in jerusalem and built city for defence in judah he built even bethlehem and etam and tekoa and bethzur and shoco and adullam and gath and mareshah and ziph and adoraim and lachish and azekah and zorah and aijalon and hebron which be in judah and in benjamin fence city and he fortify the strong hold and put captain in them and store of victual and of oil and wine and in every several city he put shield and spear and make them exceed strong have judah and benjamin on his side and the priest and the levite that be in all israel resort to him out of all their coast for the levite left their suburb and their possession and come to judah and jerusalem for jeroboam and his son have cast them off from execute the priest office unto the lord and he ordain him priest for the high place and for the devil and for the calf which he have make and after them out of all the tribe of israel such a set their heart to seek the lord god of israel come to jerusalem to sacrifice unto the lord god of their father so they strengthen the kingdom of judah and make rehoboam the son of solomon strong three year for three year they walk in the way of david and solomon and rehoboam take him mahalath the daughter of jerimoth the son of david to wife and abihail the daughter of eliab the son of jesse which bare him child jeush and shamariah and zaham and after her he take maachah the daughter of absalom which bare him abijah and attai and ziza and shelomith and rehoboam love maachah the daughter of absalom above all his wife and his concubine for he take eighteen wife and threescore concubine and begat twenty and eight son and threescore daughter and rehoboam make abijah the son of maachah the chief to be ruler among his brother for he thought to make him king and he dealt wisely and disperse of all his child throughout all the country of judah and benjamin unto every fence city and he give them victual in abundance and he desire many wife and it come to pas when rehoboam have establish the kingdom and have strengthen himself he forsook the law of the lord and all israel with him and it come to pas that in the fifth year of king rehoboam shishak king of egypt come up against jerusalem because they have transgress against the lord with twelve hundred chariot and threescore thousand horseman and the people be without number that come with him out of egypt the lubims the sukkiims and the ethiopian and he take the fence city which pertain to judah and come to jerusalem then come shemaiah the prophet to rehoboam and to the prince of judah that be gather together to jerusalem because of shishak and say unto them thus saith the lord ye have forsaken me and therefore have also left you in the hand of shishak whereupon the prince of israel and the king humble themselves and they say the lord be righteous and when the lord saw that they humble themselves the word of the lord come to shemaiah say they have humble themselves therefore will not destroy them but will grant them some deliverance and my wrath shall not be pour out upon jerusalem by the hand of shishak nevertheless they shall be his servant that they may know my service and the service of the kingdom of the country so shishak king of egypt come up against jerusalem and take away the treasure of the house of the lord and the treasure of the king house he take all he carry away also the shield of gold which solomon have make instead of which king rehoboam make shield of brass and commit them to the hand of the chief of the guard that kept the entrance of the king house and when the king enter into the house of the lord the guard come and fetch them and brought them again into the guard chamber and when he humble himself the wrath of the lord turn from him that he would not destroy him altogether and also in judah thing go well so king rehoboam strengthen himself in jerusalem and reign for rehoboam be one and forty year old when he begin to reign and he reign seventeen year in jerusalem the city which the lord have chosen out of all the tribe of israel to put his name there and his mother name be naamah an ammonite and he do evil because he prepared not his heart to seek the lord now the act of rehoboam first and last be they not write in the book of shemaiah the prophet and of iddo the seer concern genealogy and there be war between rehoboam and jeroboam continually and rehoboam slept with his father and be bury in the city of david and abijah his son reign in his stead now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam begin abijah to reign over judah he reign three year in jerusalem his mother name also be michaiah the daughter of uriel of gibeah and there be war between abijah and jeroboam and abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war even four hundred thousand chosen men jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men be mighty men of valour and abijah stood up upon mount zemaraim which be in mount ephraim and say hear me thou jeroboam and all israel ought ye not to know that the lord god of israel give the kingdom over israel to david for ever even to him and to his son by covenant of salt yet jeroboam the son of nebat the servant of solomon the son of david be risen up and hath rebel against his lord and there be gather unto him vain men the child of belial and have strengthen themselves against rehoboam the son of solomon when rehoboam be young and tenderhearted and could not withstand them and now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the lord in the hand of the son of david and ye be great multitude and there be with your golden calf which jeroboam make you for god have ye not cast out the priest of the lord the son of aaron and the levite and have make you priest after the manner of the nation of other land so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with young bullock and seven ram the same may be priest of them that be no god but a for u the lord be our god and we have not forsaken him and the priest which minister unto the lord be the son of aaron and the levite wait upon their business and they burn unto the lord every morning and every even burnt sacrifice and sweet incense the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure table and the candlestick of gold with the lamp thereof to burn every even for we keep the charge of the lord our god but ye have forsaken him and behold god himself be with u for our captain and his priest with sound trumpet to cry alarm against you child of israel fight ye not against the lord god of your father for ye shall not prosper but jeroboam cause an ambushment to come about behind them so they be before judah and the ambushment be behind them and when judah look back behold the battle be before and behind and they cry unto the lord and the priest sound with the trumpet then the men of judah give shout and a the men of judah shout it come to pas that god smote jeroboam and all israel before abijah and judah and the child of israel flee before judah and god deliver them into their hand and abijah and his people slew them with great slaughter so there fell down slain of israel five hundred thousand chosen men thus the child of israel be brought under at that time and the child of judah prevail because they rely upon the lord god of their father and abijah pursue after jeroboam and take city from him bethel with the town thereof and jeshanah with the town thereof and ephraim with the town thereof neither do jeroboam recover strength again in the day of abijah and the lord struck him and he die but abijah waxed mighty and married fourteen wife and begat twenty and two son and sixteen daughter and the rest of the act of abijah and his way and his saying be write in the story of the prophet iddo so abijah slept with his father and they bury him in the city of david and asa his son reign in his stead in his day the land be quiet ten year and asa do that which be good and right in the eye of the lord his god for he take away the altar of the strange god and the high place and brake down the image and cut down the grove and command judah to seek the lord god of their father and to do the law and the commandment also he take away out of all the city of judah the high place and the image and the kingdom be quiet before him and he built fence city in judah for the land have rest and he have no war in those year because the lord have give him rest therefore he say unto judah let u build these city and make about them wall and tower gate and bar while the land be yet before u because we have sought the lord our god we have sought him and he hath give u rest on every side so they built and prosper and asa have an army of men that bare target and spear out of judah three hundred thousand and out of benjamin that bare shield and drew bow two hundred and fourscore thousand all these be mighty men of valour and there come out against them zerah the ethiopian with an host of thousand thousand and three hundred chariot and come unto mareshah then asa go out against him and they set the battle in array in the valley of zephathah at mareshah and asa cry unto the lord his god and say lord it be nothing with thee to help whether with many or with them that have no power help u lord our god for we rest on thee and in thy name we go against this multitude lord thou art our god let no man prevail against thee so the lord smote the ethiopian before asa and before judah and the ethiopian flee and asa and the people that be with him pursue them unto gerar and the ethiopian be overthrown that they could not recover themselves for they be destroyed before the lord and before his host and they carry away very much spoil and they smote all the city round about gerar for the fear of the lord come upon them and they spoil all the city for there be exceed much spoil in them they smote also the tent of cattle and carry away sheep and camel in abundance and return to jerusalem and the spirit of god come upon azariah the son of oded and he go out to meet asa and say unto him hear ye me asa and all judah and benjamin the lord be with you while ye be with him and if ye seek him he will be found of you but if ye forsake him he will forsake you now for long season israel hath be without the true god and without teach priest and without law but when they in their trouble do turn unto the lord god of israel and sought him he be found of them and in those time there be no peace to him that go out nor to him that come in but great vexation be upon all the inhabitant of the country and nation be destroyed of nation and city of city for god do vex them with all adversity be ye strong therefore and let not your hand be weak for your work shall be reward and when asa heard these word and the prophecy of oded the prophet he take courage and put away the abominable idol out of all the land of judah and benjamin and out of the city which he have take from mount ephraim and renew the altar of the lord that be before the porch of the lord and he gather all judah and benjamin and the stranger with them out of ephraim and manasseh and out of simeon for they fell to him out of israel in abundance when they saw that the lord his god be with him so they gather themselves together at jerusalem in the third month in the fifteenth year of the reign of asa and they offer unto the lord the same time of the spoil which they have brought seven hundred ox and seven thousand sheep and they enter into covenant to seek the lord god of their father with all their heart and with all their soul that whosoever would not seek the lord god of israel should be put to death whether small or great whether man or woman and they sware unto the lord with loud voice and with shout and with trumpet and with cornet and all judah rejoice at the oath for they have sworn with all their heart and sought him with their whole desire and he be found of them and the lord give them rest round about and also concern maachah the mother of asa the king he remove her from be queen because she have make an idol in grove and asa cut down her idol and stamp it and burnt it at the brook kidron but the high place be not take away out of israel nevertheless the heart of asa be perfect all his day and he brought into the house of god the thing that his father have dedicate and that he himself have dedicate silver and gold and vessel and there be no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of asa in the six and thirtieth year of the reign of asa baasha king of israel come up against judah and built ramah to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to asa king of judah then asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasure of the house of the lord and of the king house and sent to benhadad king of syria that dwelt at damascus say there be league between me and thee a there be between my father and thy father behold have sent thee silver and gold go break thy league with baasha king of israel that he may depart from me and benhadad hearken unto king asa and sent the captain of his army against the city of israel and they smote ijon and dan and abelmaim and all the store city of naphtali and it come to pas when baasha heard it that he left off building of ramah and let his work cease then asa the king take all judah and they carry away the stone of ramah and the timber thereof wherewith baasha be building and he built therewith geba and mizpah and at that time hanani the seer come to asa king of judah and say unto him because thou hast rely on the king of syria and not rely on the lord thy god therefore be the host of the king of syria escape out of thine hand be not the ethiopian and the lubims huge host with very many chariot and horseman yet because thou didst rely on the lord he deliver them into thine hand for the eye of the lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart be perfect toward him herein thou hast do foolishly therefore from henceforth thou shalt have war then asa be wroth with the seer and put him in prison house for he be in rage with him because of this thing and asa oppress some of the people the same time and behold the act of asa first and last lo they be write in the book of the king of judah and israel and asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign be diseased in his foot until his disease be exceed great yet in his disease he sought not to the lord but to the physician and asa slept with his father and die in the one and fortieth year of his reign and they bury him in his own sepulchre which he have make for himself in the city of david and laid him in the bed which be fill with sweet odour and diver kind of spice prepared by the apothecary art and they make very great burning for him and jehoshaphat his son reign in his stead and strengthen himself against israel and he place force in all the fence city of judah and set garrison in the land of judah and in the city of ephraim which asa his father have take and the lord be with jehoshaphat because he walk in the first way of his father david and sought not unto baalim but sought to the lord god of his father and walk in his commandment and not after the doings of israel therefore the lord stablished the kingdom in his hand and all judah brought to jehoshaphat present and he have rich and honour in abundance and his heart be lift up in the way of the lord moreover he take away the high place and grove out of judah also in the third year of his reign he sent to his prince even to benhail and to obadiah and to zechariah and to nethaneel and to michaiah to teach in the city of judah and with them he sent levite even shemaiah and nethaniah and zebadiah and asahel and shemiramoth and jehonathan and adonijah and tobijah and tobadonijah levite and with them elishama and jehoram priest and they taught in judah and have the book of the law of the lord with them and go about throughout all the city of judah and taught the people and the fear of the lord fell upon all the kingdom of the land that be round about judah so that they make no war against jehoshaphat also some of the philistine brought jehoshaphat present and tribute silver and the arabian brought him flock seven thousand and seven hundred ram and seven thousand and seven hundred he goat and jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly and he built in judah castle and city of store and he have much business in the city of judah and the men of war mighty men of valour be in jerusalem and these be the number of them accord to the house of their father of judah the captain of thousand adnah the chief and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand and next to him be jehohanan the captain and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand and next him be amasiah the son of zichri who willingly offer himself unto the lord and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour and of benjamin eliada mighty man of valour and with him arm men with bow and shield two hundred thousand and next him be jehozabad and with him an hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war these wait on the king beside those whom the king put in the fence city throughout all judah now jehoshaphat have rich and honour in abundance and join affinity with ahab and after certain year he go down to ahab to samaria and ahab kill sheep and ox for him in abundance and for the people that he have with him and persuade him to go up with him to ramothgilead and ahab king of israel say unto jehoshaphat king of judah wilt thou go with me to ramothgilead and he answer him be a thou art and my people a thy people and we will be with thee in the war and jehoshaphat say unto the king of israel enquire pray thee at the word of the lord to day therefore the king of israel gather together of prophet four hundred men and say unto them shall we go to ramothgilead to battle or shall forbear and they say go up for god will deliver it into the king hand but jehoshaphat say be there not here prophet of the lord besides that we might enquire of him and the king of israel say unto jehoshaphat there be yet one man by whom we may enquire of the lord but hate him for he never prophesy good unto me but always evil the same be micaiah the son of imla and jehoshaphat say let not the king say so and the king of israel call for one of his officer and say fetch quickly micaiah the son of imla and the king of israel and jehoshaphat king of judah sat either of them on his throne clothed in their robe and they sat in void place at the enter in of the gate of samaria and all the prophet prophesy before them and zedekiah the son of chenaanah have make him horn of iron and say thus saith the lord with these thou shalt push syria until they be consume and all the prophet prophesy so say go up to ramothgilead and prosper for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king and the messenger that go to call micaiah spake to him say behold the word of the prophet declare good to the king with one assent let thy word therefore pray thee be like one of their and speak thou good and micaiah say a the lord liveth even what my god saith that will speak and when he be come to the king the king say unto him micaiah shall we go to ramothgilead to battle or shall forbear and he say go ye up and prosper and they shall be deliver into your hand and the king say to him how many time shall adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the lord then he say do see all israel scatter upon the mountain a sheep that have no shepherd and the lord say these have no master let them return therefore every man to his house in peace and the king of israel say to jehoshaphat do not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me but evil again he say therefore hear the word of the lord saw the lord sit upon his throne and all the host of heaven stand on his right hand and on his left and the lord say who shall entice ahab king of israel that he may go up and fall at ramothgilead and one spake say after this manner and another say after that manner then there come out spirit and stood before the lord and say will entice him and the lord say unto him wherewith and he say will go out and be lie spirit in the mouth of all his prophet and the lord say thou shalt entice him and thou shalt also prevail go out and do even so now therefore behold the lord hath put lie spirit in the mouth of these thy prophet and the lord hath spoken evil against thee then zedekiah the son of chenaanah come near and smote micaiah upon the cheek and say which way go the spirit of the lord from me to speak unto thee and micaiah say behold thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself then the king of israel say take ye micaiah and carry him back to amon the governor of the city and to joash the king son and say thus saith the king put this fellow in the prison and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until return in peace and micaiah say if thou certainly return in peace then hath not the lord spoken by me and he say hearken all ye people so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah go up to ramothgilead and the king of israel say unto jehoshaphat will disguise myself and will go to the battle but put thou on thy robe so the king of israel disguise himself and they go to the battle now the king of syria have command the captain of the chariot that be with him say fight ye not with small or great save only with the king of israel and it come to pas when the captain of the chariot saw jehoshaphat that they say it be the king of israel therefore they compass about him to fight but jehoshaphat cry out and the lord help him and god move them to depart from him for it come to pas that when the captain of the chariot perceive that it be not the king of israel they turn back again from pursue him and certain man drew bow at venture and smote the king of israel between the joint of the harness therefore he say to his chariot man turn thine hand that thou mayest carry me out of the host for be wound and the battle increase that day howbeit the king of israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the syrian until the even and about the time of the sun go down he die and jehoshaphat the king of judah return to his house in peace to jerusalem and jehu the son of hanani the seer go out to meet him and say to king jehoshaphat shouldest thou help the ungodly and love them that hate the lord therefore be wrath upon thee from before the lord nevertheless there be good thing found in thee in that thou hast take away the grove out of the land and hast prepared thine heart to seek god and jehoshaphat dwelt at jerusalem and he go out again through the people from beersheba to mount ephraim and brought them back unto the lord god of their father and he set judge in the land throughout all the fence city of judah city by city and say to the judge take heed what ye do for ye judge not for man but for the lord who be with you in the judgment wherefore now let the fear of the lord be upon you take heed and do it for there be no iniquity with the lord our god nor respect of person nor take of gift moreover in jerusalem do jehoshaphat set of the levite and of the priest and of the chief of the father of israel for the judgment of the lord and for controversy when they return to jerusalem and he charge them say thus shall ye do in the fear of the lord faithfully and with perfect heart and what cause soever shall come to you of your brother that dwell in your city between blood and blood between law and commandment statute and judgment ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against the lord and so wrath come upon you and upon your brother this do and ye shall not trespass and behold amariah the chief priest be over you in all matter of the lord and zebadiah the son of ishmael the ruler of the house of judah for all the king matter also the levite shall be officer before you deal courageously and the lord shall be with the good it come to pas after this also that the child of moab and the child of ammon and with them other beside the ammonite come against jehoshaphat to battle then there come some that told jehoshaphat say there cometh great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side syria and behold they be in hazazontamar which be engedi and jehoshaphat fear and set himself to seek the lord and proclaim fast throughout all judah and judah gather themselves together to ask help of the lord even out of all the city of judah they come to seek the lord and jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of judah and jerusalem in the house of the lord before the new court and say lord god of our father art not thou god in heaven and rulest not thou over all the kingdom of the heathen and in thine hand be there not power and might so that none be able to withstand thee art not thou our god who didst drive out the inhabitant of this land before thy people israel and gavest it to the seed of abraham thy friend for ever and they dwelt therein and have built thee sanctuary therein for thy name say if when evil cometh upon u a the sword judgment or pestilence or famine we stand before this house and in thy presence for thy name be in this house and cry unto thee in our affliction then thou wilt hear and help and now behold the child of ammon and moab and mount seir whom thou wouldest not let israel invade when they come out of the land of egypt but they turn from them and destroyed them not behold say how they reward u to come to cast u out of thy possession which thou hast give u to inherit our god wilt thou not judge them for we have no might against this great company that cometh against u neither know we what to do but our eye be upon thee and all judah stood before the lord with their little one their wife and their child then upon jahaziel the son of zechariah the son of benaiah the son of jeiel the son of mattaniah levite of the son of asaph come the spirit of the lord in the midst of the congregation and he say hearken ye all judah and ye inhabitant of jerusalem and thou king jehoshaphat thus saith the lord unto you be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle be not yours but god to morrow go ye down against them behold they come up by the cliff of ziz and ye shall find them at the end of the brook before the wilderness of jeruel ye shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand ye still and see the salvation of the lord with you judah and jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed to morrow go out against them for the lord will be with you and jehoshaphat bow his head with his face to the ground and all judah and the inhabitant of jerusalem fell before the lord worship the lord and the levite of the child of the kohathites and of the child of the korhites stood up to praise the lord god of israel with loud voice on high and they rise early in the morning and go forth into the wilderness of tekoa and a they go forth jehoshaphat stood and say hear me judah and ye inhabitant of jerusalem believe in the lord your god so shall ye be establish believe his prophet so shall ye prosper and when he have consult with the people he appoint singer unto the lord and that should praise the beauty of holiness a they go out before the army and to say praise the lord for his mercy endureth for ever and when they begin to sing and to praise the lord set ambushments against the child of ammon moab and mount seir which be come against judah and they be smitten for the child of ammon and moab stood up against the inhabitant of mount seir utterly to slay and destroy them and when they have make an end of the inhabitant of seir every one help to destroy another and when judah come toward the watch tower in the wilderness they look unto the multitude and behold they be dead body fall to the earth and none escape and when jehoshaphat and his people come to take away the spoil of them they found among them in abundance both rich with the dead body and precious jewel which they strip off for themselves more than they could carry away and they be three day in gathering of the spoil it be so much and on the fourth day they assemble themselves in the valley of berachah for there they bless the lord therefore the name of the same place be call the valley of berachah unto this day then they return every man of judah and jerusalem and jehoshaphat in the forefront of them to go again to jerusalem with joy for the lord have make them to rejoice over their enemy and they come to jerusalem with psaltery and harp and trumpet unto the house of the lord and the fear of god be on all the kingdom of those country when they have heard that the lord fought against the enemy of israel so the realm of jehoshaphat be quiet for his god give him rest round about and jehoshaphat reign over judah he be thirty and five year old when he begin to reign and he reign twenty and five year in jerusalem and his mother name be azubah the daughter of shilhi and he walk in the way of asa his father and depart not from it do that which be right in the sight of the lord howbeit the high place be not take away for a yet the people have not prepared their heart unto the god of their father now the rest of the act of jehoshaphat first and last behold they be write in the book of jehu the son of hanani who be mention in the book of the king of israel and after this do jehoshaphat king of judah join himself with ahaziah king of israel who do very wickedly and he join himself with him to make ship to go to tarshish and they make the ship in eziongaber then eliezer the son of dodavah of mareshah prophesy against jehoshaphat say because thou hast join thyself with ahaziah the lord hath broken thy work and the ship be broken that they be not able to go to tarshish now jehoshaphat slept with his father and be bury with his father in the city of david and jehoram his son reign in his stead and he have brother the son of jehoshaphat azariah and jehiel and zechariah and azariah and michael and shephatiah all these be the son of jehoshaphat king of israel and their father give them great gift of silver and of gold and of precious thing with fence city in judah but the kingdom give he to jehoram because he be the firstborn now when jehoram be risen up to the kingdom of his father he strengthen himself and slew all his brother with the sword and diver also of the prince of israel jehoram be thirty and two year old when he begin to reign and he reign eight year in jerusalem and he walk in the way of the king of israel like a do the house of ahab for he have the daughter of ahab to wife and he wrought that which be evil in the eye of the lord howbeit the lord would not destroy the house of david because of the covenant that he have make with david and a he promise to give light to him and to his son for ever in his day the edomites revolt from under the dominion of judah and make themselves king then jehoram go forth with his prince and all his chariot with him and he rise up by night and smote the edomites which compass him in and the captain of the chariot so the edomites revolt from under the hand of judah unto this day the same time also do libnah revolt from under his hand because he have forsaken the lord god of his father moreover he make high place in the mountain of judah and cause the inhabitant of jerusalem to commit fornication and compel judah thereto and there come write to him from elijah the prophet say thus saith the lord god of david thy father because thou hast not walk in the way of jehoshaphat thy father nor in the way of asa king of judah but hast walk in the way of the king of israel and hast make judah and the inhabitant of jerusalem to go whore like to the whoredom of the house of ahab and also hast slain thy brother of thy father house which be well than thyself behold with great plague will the lord smite thy people and thy child and thy wife and all thy good and thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowel until thy bowel fall out by reason of the sickness day by day moreover the lord stir up against jehoram the spirit of the philistine and of the arabian that be near the ethiopian and they come up into judah and brake into it and carry away all the substance that be found in the king house and his son also and his wife so that there be never son left him save jehoahaz the young of his son and after all this the lord smote him in his bowel with an incurable disease and it come to pas that in process of time after the end of two year his bowel fell out by reason of his sickness so he die of sore disease and his people make no burning for him like the burning of his father thirty and two year old be he when he begin to reign and he reign in jerusalem eight year and depart without be desire howbeit they bury him in the city of david but not in the sepulchre of the king and the inhabitant of jerusalem make ahaziah his young son king in his stead for the band of men that come with the arabian to the camp have slain all the eldest so ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah reign forty and two year old be ahaziah when he begin to reign and he reign one year in jerusalem his mother name also be athaliah the daughter of omri he also walk in the way of the house of ahab for his mother be his counsellor to do wickedly wherefore he do evil in the sight of the lord like the house of ahab for they be his counsellor after the death of his father to his destruction he walk also after their counsel and go with jehoram the son of ahab king of israel to war against hazael king of syria at ramothgilead and the syrian smote joram and he return to be heal in jezreel because of the wound which be give him at ramah when he fought with hazael king of syria and azariah the son of jehoram king of judah go down to see jehoram the son of ahab at jezreel because he be sick and the destruction of ahaziah be of god by come to joram for when he be come he go out with jehoram against jehu the son of nimshi whom the lord have anoint to cut off the house of ahab and it come to pas that when jehu be execute judgment upon the house of ahab and found the prince of judah and the son of the brother of ahaziah that minister to ahaziah he slew them and he sought ahaziah and they caught him for he be hid in samaria and brought him to jehu and when they have slain him they bury him because say they he be the son of jehoshaphat who sought the lord with all his heart so the house of ahaziah have no power to keep still the kingdom but when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son be dead she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of judah but jehoshabeath the daughter of the king take joash the son of ahaziah and stole him from among the king son that be slain and put him and his nurse in bedchamber so jehoshabeath the daughter of king jehoram the wife of jehoiada the priest for she be the sister of ahaziah hid him from athaliah so that she slew him not and he be with them hid in the house of god six year and athaliah reign over the land and in the seventh year jehoiada strengthen himself and take the captain of hundred azariah the son of jeroham and ishmael the son of jehohanan and azariah the son of obed and maaseiah the son of adaiah and elishaphat the son of zichri into covenant with him and they go about in judah and gather the levite out of all the city of judah and the chief of the father of israel and they come to jerusalem and all the congregation make covenant with the king in the house of god and he say unto them behold the king son shall reign a the lord hath say of the son of david this be the thing that ye shall do third part of you enter on the sabbath of the priest and of the levite shall be porter of the door and third part shall be at the king house and third part at the gate of the foundation and all the people shall be in the court of the house of the lord but let none come into the house of the lord save the priest and they that minister of the levite they shall go in for they be holy but all the people shall keep the watch of the lord and the levite shall compass the king round about every man with his weapon in his hand and whosoever else cometh into the house he shall be put to death but be ye with the king when he cometh in and when he goeth out so the levite and all judah do accord to all thing that jehoiada the priest have command and take every man his men that be to come in on the sabbath with them that be to go out on the sabbath for jehoiada the priest dismiss not the course moreover jehoiada the priest deliver to the captain of hundred spear and buckler and shield that have be king david which be in the house of god and he set all the people every man have his weapon in his hand from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple along by the altar and the temple by the king round about then they brought out the king son and put upon him the crown and give him the testimony and make him king and jehoiada and his son anoint him and say god save the king now when athaliah heard the noise of the people run and praise the king she come to the people into the house of the lord and she look and behold the king stood at his pillar at the enter in and the prince and the trumpet by the king and all the people of the land rejoice and sound with trumpet also the singer with instrument of musick and such a taught to sing praise then athaliah rent her clothes and say treason treason then jehoiada the priest brought out the captain of hundred that be set over the host and say unto them have her forth of the range and whoso followeth her let him be slain with the sword for the priest say slay her not in the house of the lord so they laid hand on her and when she be come to the enter of the horse gate by the king house they slew her there and jehoiada make covenant between him and between all the people and between the king that they should be the lord people then all the people go to the house of baal and brake it down and brake his altar and his image in piece and slew mattan the priest of baal before the altar also jehoiada appoint the office of the house of the lord by the hand of the priest the levite whom david have distribute in the house of the lord to offer the burnt offering of the lord a it be write in the law of moses with rejoice and with sing a it be ordain by david and he set the porter at the gate of the house of the lord that none which be unclean in any thing should enter in and he take the captain of hundred and the noble and the governor of the people and all the people of the land and brought down the king from the house of the lord and they come through the high gate into the king house and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom and all the people of the land rejoice and the city be quiet after that they have slain athaliah with the sword joash be seven year old when he begin to reign and he reign forty year in jerusalem his mother name also be zibiah of beersheba and joash do that which be right in the sight of the lord all the day of jehoiada the priest and jehoiada take for him two wife and he begat son and daughter and it come to pas after this that joash be mind to repair the house of the lord and he gather together the priest and the levite and say to them go out unto the city of judah and gather of all israel money to repair the house of your god from year to year and see that ye hasten the matter howbeit the levite hasten it not and the king call for jehoiada the chief and say unto him why hast thou not require of the levite to bring in out of judah and out of jerusalem the collection accord to the commandment of moses the servant of the lord and of the congregation of israel for the tabernacle of witness for the son of athaliah that wicked woman have broken up the house of god and also all the dedicate thing of the house of the lord do they bestow upon baalim and at the king commandment they make chest and set it without at the gate of the house of the lord and they make proclamation through judah and jerusalem to bring in to the lord the collection that moses the servant of god laid upon israel in the wilderness and all the prince and all the people rejoice and brought in and cast into the chest until they have make an end now it come to pas that at what time the chest be brought unto the king office by the hand of the levite and when they saw that there be much money the king scribe and the high priest officer come and empty the chest and take it and carry it to his place again thus they do day by day and gather money in abundance and the king and jehoiada give it to such a do the work of the service of the house of the lord and hire mason and carpenter to repair the house of the lord and also such a wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the lord so the workman wrought and the work be perfect by them and they set the house of god in his state and strengthen it and when they have finish it they brought the rest of the money before the king and jehoiada whereof be make vessel for the house of the lord even vessel to minister and to offer withal and spoon and vessel of gold and silver and they offer burnt offering in the house of the lord continually all the day of jehoiada but jehoiada waxed old and be full of day when he die an hundred and thirty year old be he when he die and they bury him in the city of david among the king because he have do good in israel both toward god and toward his house now after the death of jehoiada come the prince of judah and make obeisance to the king then the king hearken unto them and they left the house of the lord god of their father and serve grove and idol and wrath come upon judah and jerusalem for this their trespass yet he sent prophet to them to bring them again unto the lord and they testify against them but they would not give ear and the spirit of god come upon zechariah the son of jehoiada the priest which stood above the people and say unto them thus saith god why transgress ye the commandment of the lord that ye cannot prosper because ye have forsaken the lord he hath also forsaken you and they conspire against him and stone him with stone at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the lord thus joash the king remember not the kindness which jehoiada his father have do to him but slew his son and when he die he say the lord look upon it and require it and it come to pas at the end of the year that the host of syria come up against him and they come to judah and jerusalem and destroyed all the prince of the people from among the people and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of damascus for the army of the syrian come with small company of men and the lord deliver very great host into their hand because they have forsaken the lord god of their father so they execute judgment against joash and when they be depart from him for they left him in great disease his own servant conspire against him for the blood of the son of jehoiada the priest and slew him on his bed and he die and they bury him in the city of david but they bury him not in the sepulchre of the king and these be they that conspire against him zabad the son of shimeath an ammonite and jehozabad the son of shimrith moabitess now concern his son and the greatness of the burden laid upon him and the repair of the house of god behold they be write in the story of the book of the king and amaziah his son reign in his stead amaziah be twenty and five year old when he begin to reign and he reign twenty and nine year in jerusalem and his mother name be jehoaddan of jerusalem and he do that which be right in the sight of the lord but not with perfect heart now it come to pas when the kingdom be establish to him that he slew his servant that have kill the king his father but he slew not their child but do a it be write in the law in the book of moses where the lord command say the father shall not die for the child neither shall the child die for the father but every man shall die for his own sin moreover amaziah gather judah together and make them captain over thousand and captain over hundred accord to the house of their father throughout all judah and benjamin and he numbered them from twenty year old and above and found them three hundred thousand choice men able to go forth to war that could handle spear and shield he hire also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of israel for an hundred talent of silver but there come man of god to him say king let not the army of israel go with thee for the lord be not with israel to wit with all the child of ephraim but if thou wilt go do it be strong for the battle god shall make thee fall before the enemy for god hath power to help and to cast down and amaziah say to the man of god but what shall we do for the hundred talent which have give to the army of israel and the man of god answer the lord be able to give thee much more than this then amaziah separate them to wit the army that be come to him out of ephraim to go home again wherefore their anger be greatly kindle against judah and they return home in great anger and amaziah strengthen himself and lead forth his people and go to the valley of salt and smote of the child of seir ten thousand and other ten thousand left alive do the child of judah carry away captive and brought them unto the top of the rock and cast them down from the top of the rock that they all be broken in piece but the soldier of the army which amaziah sent back that they should not go with him to battle fell upon the city of judah from samaria even unto bethhoron and smote three thousand of them and take much spoil now it come to pas after that amaziah be come from the slaughter of the edomites that he brought the god of the child of seir and set them up to be his god and bow down himself before them and burn incense unto them wherefore the anger of the lord be kindle against amaziah and he sent unto him prophet which say unto him why hast thou sought after the god of the people which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand and it come to pas a he talk with him that the king say unto him art thou make of the king counsel forbear why shouldest thou be smitten then the prophet forbare and say know that god hath determine to destroy thee because thou hast do this and hast not hearken unto my counsel then amaziah king of judah take advice and sent to joash the son of jehoahaz the son of jehu king of israel say come let u see one another in the face and joash king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah say the thistle that be in lebanon sent to the cedar that be in lebanon say give thy daughter to my son to wife and there pass by wild beast that be in lebanon and trode down the thistle thou sayest lo thou hast smitten the edomites and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast abide now at home why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt that thou shouldest fall even thou and judah with thee but amaziah would not hear for it come of god that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemy because they sought after the god of edom so joash the king of israel go up and they saw one another in the face both he and amaziah king of judah at bethshemesh which belongeth to judah and judah be put to the bad before israel and they flee every man to his tent and joash the king of israel take amaziah king of judah the son of joash the son of jehoahaz at bethshemesh and brought him to jerusalem and brake down the wall of jerusalem from the gate of ephraim to the corner gate four hundred cubit and he take all the gold and the silver and all

do turn away from follow the lord they make conspiracy against him in jerusalem and he flee to lachish but they sent to lachish after him and slew him there and they brought him upon horse and bury him with his father in the city of judah then all the people of judah take uzziah who be sixteen year old and make him king in the room of his father amaziah he built eloth and restore it to judah after that the king slept with his father sixteen year old be uzziah when he begin to reign and he reign fifty and two year in jerusalem his mother name also be jecoliah of jerusalem and he do that which be right in the sight of the lord accord to all that his father amaziah do and he sought god in the day of zechariah who have understand in the vision of god and a long a he sought the lord god

them in rage that reacheth up unto heaven and now ye purpose to keep under the child of judah and jerusalem for bondman and bondwoman unto you but be there not with you even with you sin against the lord your god now hear me therefore and deliver the captive again which ye have take captive of your brother for the fierce wrath of the lord be upon you then certain of the head of the child of ephraim azariah the son of johanan berechiah the son of meshillemoth and jehizkiah the son of shallum and amasa the son of hadlai stood up against them that come from the war and say unto them ye shall not bring in the captive hither for whereas we have offend against the lord already ye intend to add more to our sin and to our trespass for our trespass be great and there be fierce wrath

cut in piece the vessel of the house of god and shut up the door of the house of the lord and he make him altar in every corner of jerusalem and in every several city of judah he make high place to burn incense unto other god and provoke to anger the lord god of his father now the rest of his act and of all his way first and last behold they be write in the book of the king of judah and israel and ahaz slept with his father and they bury him in the city even in jerusalem but they brought him not into the sepulchre of the king of israel and hezekiah his son reign in his stead hezekiah begin

back also they have shut up the door of the porch and put out the lamp and have not burn incense nor offer burnt offering in the holy place unto the god of israel wherefore the wrath of the lord be upon judah and jerusalem and he hath deliver them to trouble to astonishment and to hiss a ye see with your eye for lo our father have fall by the sword and our son and our daughter and our wife be in captivity for this now it be in mine heart to make covenant with the lord god of israel that his fierce wrath may turn away from u my son be not now negligent for the lord hath chosen you to stand before him to serve him and that ye should minister unto him and burn incense then the levite arose mahath the son of amasai and joel the son of azariah of the son of the kohathites and of the son of merari kish the son of abdi and azariah the son of jehalelel and of the gershonites joah the son of zimmah and eden the son of joah and of the son of elizaphan shimri and jeiel and of the son of asaph zechariah and mattaniah and of the son of heman jehiel and shimei and of the son of jeduthun shemaiah and uzziel and they gather their brother and sanctify themselves and come accord to the commandment of the king by the word of the lord to cleanse the house of the lord and the priest go into the inner part of the house of the lord to cleanse it and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the lord into the court of the house of the lord and the levite take it to carry it out abroad into the brook kidron now they begin on the first day of the first month to sanctify and on the eighth day of the month come they to the porch of the lord so they sanctify the house of the lord in eight day and in the sixteenth day of the first month they make an end then they go in to hezekiah the king and say we have cleanse all the house of the lord and the altar of burnt offering with all the vessel thereof and the shewbread table with all the vessel thereof moreover all the vessel which king ahaz in his reign do cast away in his transgression have we prepared and sanctify and behold they be before the altar of the lord then hezekiah the king rise early and gather the ruler of the city and go up to the house of the lord and they brought seven bullock and seven ram and seven lamb and seven he goat for sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for judah and he command the priest the son of aaron to offer them on the altar of the lord so they kill the bullock and the priest receive the blood and sprinkle it on the altar likewise when they have kill the ram they sprinkle the blood upon the altar they kill also the lamb and they sprinkle the blood upon the altar and they brought forth the he goat for the sin offering before the king and the congregation and they laid their hand upon them and the priest kill them and they make reconciliation with their blood upon the altar to make an atonement for all israel for the king command that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be make for all israel and he set the levite in the house of the lord with cymbal with psaltery and with harp accord to the commandment of david and of gad the king seer and nathan the prophet for so be the commandment of the lord by his prophet and the levite stood with the instrument of david and the priest with the trumpet and hezekiah command to offer the burnt offering upon the altar and when the burnt offering begin the song of the lord begin also with the trumpet and with the instrument ordain by david king of israel and all the congregation worship and the singer sang and the trumpeter sound and all this continued until the burnt offering be finish and when they have make an end of offering the king and all that be present with him bow themselves and worship moreover hezekiah the king and the prince command the levite to sing praise unto the lord with the word of david and of asaph the seer and they sang praise with gladness and they bow their head and worship then hezekiah answer and say now ye have consecrate yourselves unto the lord come near and bring sacrifice and thank offering into the house of the lord and the congregation brought in sacrifice and thank offering and a many a be of free heart burnt offering and the number of the burnt offering which the congregation brought be threescore and ten bullock an hundred ram and two hundred lamb all these be for burnt offering to the lord and the consecrate thing be six hundred ox and three thousand sheep but the priest be too few so that they could not flay all the burnt offering wherefore their brother the levite do help them till the work be end and until the other priest have sanctify themselves for the levite be more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priest and also the burnt offering be in abundance with the fat of the peace offering and the drink offering for every burnt offering so the service of the house of the lord be set in order and hezekiah rejoice and all the people that god have prepared the people for the thing be do suddenly and hezekiah sent to all israel and judah and write letter also to ephraim and manasseh that they should come to the house of the lord at jerusalem to keep the passover unto the lord god of israel for the king have take counsel and his prince and all the congregation in jerusalem to keep the passover in the second month for they could not keep it at that time because the priest have not sanctify themselves sufficiently neither have the people gather themselves together to jerusalem and the thing pleased the king and all the congregation so they establish decree to make proclamation throughout all israel from beersheba even to dan that they should come to keep the passover unto the lord god of israel at jerusalem for they have not do it of long time in such sort a it be write so the post go with the letter from the king and his prince throughout all

not stiffnecked a your father be but yield yourselves unto the lord and enter into his sanctuary which he hath sanctify for ever and serve the lord your god that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you for if ye turn again unto the lord your brother and your child shall find compassion before them that lead them captive so that they shall come again into this land for the lord your god be gracious and merciful and will not turn away his face from you if ye return unto him so the post pass from city to city through the country of ephraim and manasseh even unto zebulun but they laugh them to scorn and mocked them nevertheless diver of asher and manasseh and of zebulun humble themselves and come to jerusalem also in judah the hand of god be to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the prince by the word of the lord and there assemble at jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month very great congregation and they arose and take away the altar that be in jerusalem and all the altar for incense take they away and cast them into the brook kidron then they kill the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month and the priest and the levite be ashamed and sanctify themselves and brought in the burnt offering into the house of the lord and they stood in their place after their manner accord to the law of moses the man of god the priest sprinkle the blood which they receive of the hand of the levite for there be many in the congregation that be not sanctify therefore the levite have the charge of the kill of the passover for every one that be not clean to sanctify them unto the lord for multitude of the people even many of ephraim and manasseh issachar and zebulun have not cleanse themselves yet do they eat the passover otherwise than it be write but hezekiah prayed for them say the good lord pardon every one that prepareth his heart to seek god the lord god of his father though he be not

knowledge of the lord and they do eat throughout the feast seven day offering peace offering and make confession to the lord god of their father and the whole assembly take counsel to keep other seven day and they kept other seven day with gladness for hezekiah king of judah do give to the congregation thousand bullock and seven thousand sheep and the prince give to the congregation thousand bullock and ten thousand sheep and great number of priest sanctify themselves and all the congregation of judah with the priest and the levite and all the congregation that come out of israel and the stranger that come out of the land of israel and that dwelt in judah rejoice so there be great joy in jerusalem for since the time of solomon the son of david king of israel there be not the like in jerusalem then the priest the levite arose and bless the people and their voice be heard and their prayer come up to his holy dwell place even unto heaven now when all this be finish all israel that be present go out to the city of judah and brake the image in piece and cut down the grove and threw down the high place and the altar out of all judah and benjamin in ephraim also and manasseh until they have utterly destroyed them all then all the child of israel return every man to his possession into their own city and hezekiah appoint the course of the priest and the levite after their course every man accord to his service the priest and levite for burnt offering and for peace offering to minister and to give thanks and to praise in the gate of the tent of the lord he appoint also the king portion of his substance for the burnt offering to wit for the morning and even burnt offering and the burnt offering for the sabbath and for the new moon and for the set feast a it be write in the law of the lord moreover he command the people that dwelt in jerusalem to give the portion of the priest and the levite that they might be encourage in the law of the lord and a soon a the commandment come abroad the child of israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn wine and oil and honey and of all the increase of the field and the tithe of all thing brought they in abundantly and concern the child of israel and judah that dwelt in the city of judah they also brought in the tithe of ox and sheep and the tithe of holy thing which be consecrate unto the lord their god and laid them by heap in the third month they begin to lay the foundation of the heap and finish them in the seventh month and when hezekiah and the prince come and saw the heap they bless the lord and his people israel then hezekiah question with the priest and the levite concern the heap and azariah the chief priest of the house of zadok answer him and say since the people begin to bring the offering into the house of the lord we have have enough to eat and have left plenty for the lord hath bless his people and that which be left be this great store then hezekiah command to prepare chamber in the house of the lord and they prepared them and brought in the offering and the tithe and the dedicate thing faithfully over which cononiah the levite be ruler and shimei his brother be the next and jehiel and azaziah and nahath and asahel and jerimoth and jozabad and eliel and ismachiah and mahath and benaiah be overseer under the hand of cononiah and shimei his brother at the commandment of hezekiah the king and azariah the ruler of the house of god and kore the son of imnah the levite the porter toward the east be over the freewill offering of god to distribute the oblation of the lord and the most holy thing and next him be eden and miniamin and jeshua and shemaiah amariah and shecaniah in the city of the priest in their set office to give to their brother by course a well to the great a to the small beside their genealogy of male from three year old and upward even unto every one that entereth into the house of the lord his daily portion for their service in their charge accord to their course both to the genealogy of the priest by the house of their father and the levite from twenty year old and upward in their charge by their course and to the genealogy of all their little one their wife and their son and their daughter through all the congregation for in their set office they sanctify themselves in holiness also of the son of aaron the priest which be in the field of the suburb of their city in every several city the men that be express by name to give portion to all the male among the priest and to all that be reckon by genealogy among the levite and thus do hezekiah throughout all judah and wrought that which be good and right and truth before the lord his god and in every work that he begin in the service of the house of god and in the law and in the commandment to seek his god he do it with all his heart and prosper after these thing and the establishment thereof sennacherib king of assyria come and enter into judah and encamp against the fence city and thought to win them for himself and when hezekiah saw that sennacherib be come and that he be purpose to fight against jerusalem he take counsel with his prince and his mighty men to stop the water of the fountain which be without the city and they do help him so there be gather much people together who stop all the fountain and the brook that ran through the midst of the land say why should the king of assyria come and find much water also he strengthen himself and built up all the wall that be broken and raise it up to the tower and another wall without and repair millo in the city of david and make dart and shield in abundance and he set captain of war over the people and gather them together to him in the street of the gate of the city and spake comfortably to them say be strong and courageous be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of assyria nor for all the multitude that be with him for there be more with u than with him with him be an arm of flesh but with u be the lord our god to help u and to fight our battle and the people rest themselves upon the word of hezekiah king of judah after this do sennacherib king of assyria send his servant to jerusalem but he himself laid siege against lachish and all his power with him unto hezekiah king of judah and unto all judah that be at jerusalem say thus saith sennacherib king of assyria whereon do ye trust that ye abide in the siege in jerusalem doth not hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst say the lord our god shall deliver u out of the hand of the king of assyria hath not the same hezekiah take away his high place and his altar and command judah and jerusalem say ye shall worship before one altar and burn incense upon it know ye not what and my father have do unto all the people of other land be the god of the nation of those land any way able to deliver their land out of mine hand who be there among all the god of those nation that my father utterly destroyed that could deliver his people out of mine hand that your god should be able to deliver you out of mine hand now therefore let not hezekiah deceive you nor persuade you on this manner neither yet believe him for no god of any nation or kingdom be able to deliver his people out of mine hand and out of the hand of my father how much less shall your god deliver you out of mine hand and his servant spake yet more against the lord god and against his servant hezekiah he write also letter to rail on the lord god of israel and to speak against him say a the god of the nation of other land have not deliver their people out of mine hand so shall not the god of hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand then they cry with loud voice in the jew speech unto the people of jerusalem that be on the wall to affright them and to trouble them that they might take the city and they spake against the god of jerusalem a against the god of the people of the earth which be the work of the hand of man and for this cause hezekiah the king and the prophet isaiah the son of amoz prayed and cry to heaven and the lord sent an angel which cut off all the mighty men of valour and the leader and captain in the camp of the king of assyria so he return with shame of face to his own land and when he be come into the house of his god they that come forth of his own bowel slew him there with the sword thus the lord save hezekiah and the inhabitant of jerusalem from the hand of sennacherib the king of assyria and from the hand of all other and guide them on every side and many brought gift unto the lord to jerusalem and present to hezekiah king of judah so that he be magnify in the sight of all nation from thenceforth in those day hezekiah be sick to the death and prayed unto the lord and he spake unto him and he give him sign but hezekiah render not again accord to the benefit do unto him for his heart be lift up therefore there be wrath upon him and upon judah and jerusalem notwithstanding hezekiah humble himself for the pride of his heart both he and the inhabitant of jerusalem so that the wrath of the lord come not upon them in the day of hezekiah and hezekiah have exceed much rich and honour and he make himself treasury for silver and for gold and for precious stone and for spice and for shield and for all manner of pleasant jewel storehouse also for the increase of corn and wine and oil and stall for all manner of beast and cote for flock moreover he provide him city and possession of flock and herd in abundance for god have give him substance very much this same hezekiah also stop the upper watercourse of gihon and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of david and hezekiah prosper in all his work howbeit in the business of the ambassador of the prince of babylon who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that be do in the land god left him to try him that he might know all that be in his heart now the rest of the act of hezekiah and his goodness behold they be write in the vision of isaiah the prophet the son of amoz and in the book of the king of judah and israel and hezekiah slept with his father and they bury him in the chiefest of the sepulchre of the son of david and all judah and the inhabitant of jerusalem do him honour at his death and manasseh his son reign in his stead manasseh be twelve year old when he begin to reign and he reign fifty and five year in jerusalem but do that which be evil in the sight of the lord like unto the abomination of the heathen whom the lord have cast out before the child of israel for he built again the high place which hezekiah his father have broken down and he rear up altar for baalim and make grove and worship all the host of heaven and serve them also he built altar in the house of the lord whereof the lord have say in jerusalem shall my name be for ever and he built altar for all the host of heaven in the two court of the house of the lord and he cause his child to pas through the fire in the valley of the son of hinnom also he observe time and use enchantment and use witchcraft and dealt with familiar spirit and with wizard he wrought much evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger and he set carve image the idol which he have make in the house of god of which god have say to david and to solomon his son in this house and in jerusalem which have chosen before all the tribe of israel will put my name for ever neither will any more remove the foot of israel from out of the land which have appoint for your father so that they will take heed to do all that have command them accord to the whole law and the statute and the ordinance by the hand of moses so manasseh make judah and the inhabitant of jerusalem to err and to do bad than the heathen whom the lord have destroyed before the child of israel and the lord spake to manasseh and to his people but they would not hearken wherefore the lord brought upon them the captain of the host of the king of assyria which take manasseh among the thorn and bound him with fetter and carry him to babylon and when he be in affliction he besought the lord his god and humble himself greatly before the god of his father and prayed unto him and he be intreated of him and heard his supplication and brought him again to jerusalem into his kingdom then manasseh knew that the lord he be god now after this he built wall without the city of david on the west side of gihon in the valley even to the enter in at the fish gate and compass about ophel and raise it up very great height and put captain of war in all the fence city of judah and he take away the strange god and the idol out of the house of the lord and all the altar that he have built in the mount of the house of the lord and in jerusalem and cast them out of the city and he repair the altar of the lord and sacrifice thereon peace offering and thank offering and command judah to serve the lord god of israel nevertheless the people do sacrifice still in the high place yet unto the lord their god only now the rest of the act of manasseh and his prayer unto his god and the word of the seer that spake to him in the name of the lord god of israel behold they be write in the book of the king of israel his prayer also and how god be intreated of him and all his sin and his trespass and the place wherein he built high place and set up grove and graven image before he be humble behold they be write among the saying of the seer so manasseh slept with his father and they bury him in his own house and amon his son reign in his stead amon be two and twenty year old when he begin to reign and reign two year in jerusalem but he do that which be evil in the sight of the lord a do manasseh his father for amon sacrifice unto all the carve image which manasseh his father have make and serve them and humble not himself before the lord a manasseh his father have humble himself but amon trespass more and more and his servant conspire against him and slew him in his own house but the people of the land slew all them that have conspire against king amon and the people of the land make josiah his son king in his stead josiah be eight year old when he begin to reign and he reign in jerusalem one and thirty year and he do that which be right in the sight of the lord and walk in the way of david his father and decline neither to the right hand nor to the left for in the eighth year of his reign while he be yet young he begin to seek after the god of david his father and in the twelfth year he begin to purge judah and jerusalem from the high place and the grove and the carve image and the molten image and they brake down the altar of baalim in his presence and the image that be on high above them he cut down and the grove and the carve image and the molten image he brake in piece and make dust of them and strowed it upon the graf of them that have sacrifice unto them and he burnt the bone of the priest upon their altar and cleanse judah and jerusalem and so do he in the city of manasseh and ephraim and simeon even unto naphtali with their mattock round about and when he have broken down the altar and the grove and have beaten the graven image into powder and cut down all the idol throughout all the land of israel he return to jerusalem now in the eighteenth year of his reign when he have purge the land and the house he sent shaphan the son of azaliah and maaseiah the governor of the city and joah the son of joahaz the recorder to repair the house of the lord his god and when they come to hilkiah the high priest they deliver the money that be brought into the house of god which the levite that kept the door have gather of the hand of manasseh and ephraim and of all the remnant of israel and of all judah and benjamin and they return to jerusalem and they put it in the hand of the workman that have the oversight of the house of the lord and they give it to the workman that wrought in the house of the lord to repair and amend the house even to the artificer and builder give they it to buy hewn stone and timber for coupling and to floor the house which the king of judah have destroyed and the men do the work faithfully and the overseer of them be jahath and obadiah the levite of the son of merari and zechariah and meshullam of the son of the kohathites to set it forward and other of the levite all that could skill of instrument of musick also they be over the bearer of burden and be overseer of all that wrought the work in any manner of service and of the levite there be scribe and officer and porter and when they brought out the money that be brought into the house of the lord hilkiah the priest found book of the law of the lord give by moses and hilkiah answer and say to shaphan the scribe have found the book of the law in the house of the lord and hilkiah deliver the book to shaphan and shaphan carry the book to the king and brought the king word back again say all that be commit to thy servant they do it and they have gather together the money that be found in the house of the lord and have deliver it into the hand of the overseer and to the hand of the workman then shaphan the scribe told the king say hilkiah the priest hath give me book and shaphan read it before the king and it come to pas when the king have heard the word of the law that he rent his clothes and the king command hilkiah and ahikam the son of shaphan and abdon the son of micah and shaphan the scribe and asaiah servant of the king say go enquire of the lord for me and for them that be left in israel and in judah concern the word of the book that be found for great be the wrath of the lord that be pour out upon u because our father have not kept the word of the lord to do after all that be write in this book and hilkiah and they that the king have appoint go to huldah the prophetess the wife of shallum the son of tikvath the son of hasrah keeper of the wardrobe now she dwelt in jerusalem in the college and they spake to her to that effect and she answer them thus saith the lord god of israel tell ye the man that sent you to

mocked the jew and he spake before his brother and the army of samaria and say what do these feeble jew will they fortify themselves will they sacrifice will they make an end in day will they revive the stone out of the heap of the rubbish which be burn now tobiah the ammonite be by him and he say even that which they build if fox go up he shall even break down their stone wall hear our god for we be despise and turn their reproach upon their own head and give them for prey in the land of captivity and cover not their iniquity and let not their sin be blot out from before thee for they have provoke thee to anger before the builder so built we the wall and all the wall be join together unto the half thereof for the people have mind to work but it come to pas that when sanballat and tobiah and the arabian and the ammonite and the ashdodites heard that the wall of jerusalem be make up and that the breach begin to be stop then they be very wroth and conspire all of them together to come and to fight against jerusalem and to hinder it nevertheless we make our prayer unto our god and set watch against them day and night because of them and judah say the strength of the bearer of burden be decayed and there be much rubbish so that we be not able to build the wall and our adversary say they shall not know neither see till we come in the midst among them and slay them and cause the work to cease and it come to pas that when the jew which dwelt by them come they say unto u ten time from all place whence ye shall return unto u they will be upon you therefore set in the low place behind the wall and on the high place even set the people after their family with their sword their spear and their bow and look and rise up and say unto the noble and to the ruler and to the rest of the people be not ye afraid of them remember the lord which be great and terrible and fight for your brother your son and your daughter your wife and your house and it come to pas when our enemy heard that it be know unto u and god have brought their counsel to nought that we return all of u to the wall every one unto his work and it come to pas from that time forth that the half of my servant wrought in the work and the other half of them held both the spear the shield and the bow and the habergeon and the ruler be behind all the house of judah they which build on the wall and they that bare burden with those that lade every one with one of his hand wrought in the work and with the other hand held weapon for the builder every one have his sword gird by his side and so build and he that sound the trumpet be by me and say unto the noble and to the ruler and to the rest of the people the work be great and large and we be separate upon the wall one far from another in what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet resort ye thither unto u our god shall fight for u so we labour in the work and half of them held the spear from the rise of the morning till the star appear likewise at the same time say unto the people let every one with his servant lodge within jerusalem that in the night they may be guard to u and labour on the day so neither nor my brother nor my servant nor the men of the guard which follow me none of u put off our clothes save that every one put them off for wash and there be great cry of the people and of their wife against their brother the jew for there be that say we our son and our daughter be many therefore we take up corn for them that we may eat and live some also there be that say we have mortgage our land vineyard and house that we might buy corn because of the dearth there be also that say we have borrow money for the king tribute and that upon our land and vineyard yet now our flesh be a the flesh of our brother our child a their child and lo we bring into bondage our son and our daughter to be servant and some of our daughter be brought unto bondage already neither be it in our power to redeem them for other men have our land and vineyard and be very angry when heard their cry and these word then consult with myself and rebuke the noble and the ruler and say unto them ye exact usury every one of his brother and set great assembly against them and say unto them we after our ability have redeem our brother the jew which be sell unto the heathen and will ye even sell your brother or shall they be sell unto u then held they their peace and found nothing to answer also say it be not good that ye do ought ye not to walk in the fear of our god because of the reproach of the heathen our enemy likewise and my brother and my servant might exact of them money and corn pray you let u leave off this usury restore pray you to them even this day their land their vineyard their oliveyards and their house also the hundredth part of the money and of the corn the wine and the oil that ye exact of them then say they we will restore them and will require nothing of them so will we do a thou sayest then call the priest and take an oath of them that they should do accord to this promise also shook my lap and say so god shake out every man from his house and from his labour that performeth not this promise even thus be he shaken out and empty and all the congregation say amen and praise the lord and the people do accord to this promise moreover from the time that be appoint to be their governor in the land of judah from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of artaxerxes the king that be twelve year and my brother have not eat the bread of the governor but the former governor that have be before me be chargeable unto the people and have take of them bread and wine beside forty shekel of silver yea even their servant bare rule over the people but so do not because of the fear of god yea also continued in the work of this wall neither bought we any land and all my servant be gather thither unto the work moreover there be at my table an hundred and fifty of the jew and ruler beside those that come unto u from among the heathen that be about u now that which be prepared for me daily be one ox and six choice sheep also fowl be prepared for me and once in ten day store of all sort of wine yet for all this require not the bread of the governor because the bondage be heavy upon this people think upon me my god for good accord to all that have do for this people now it come to pas when sanballat and tobiah and geshem the arabian and the rest of our enemy heard that have build the wall and that there be no breach left therein though at that time have not set up the door upon the gate that sanballat and geshem sent unto me say come let u meet together in some one of the village in the plain of ono but they thought to do me mischief and sent messenger unto them say be do great work so that cannot come down why should the work cease whilst leave it and come down to you yet they sent unto me four time after this sort and answer them after the same manner then sent sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand wherein be write it be report among the heathen and gashmu saith it that thou and the jew think to rebel for which cause thou buildest the wall that thou mayest be their king accord to these word and thou hast also appoint prophet to preach of thee at jerusalem say there be king in judah and now shall it be report to the king accord to these word come now therefore and let u take counsel together then sent unto him say there be no such thing do a thou sayest but thou feignest them out of thine own heart for they all make u afraid say their hand shall be weaken from the work that it be not do now therefore god strengthen my hand afterward come unto the house of shemaiah the son of delaiah the son of mehetabeel who be shut up and he say let u meet together in the house of god within the temple and let u shut the door of the temple for they will come to slay thee yea in the night will they come to slay thee and say should such man a flee and who be there that be a be would go into the temple to save his life will not go in and lo perceive that god have not sent him but that he pronounce this prophecy against me for tobiah and sanballat have hire him therefore be he hire that should be afraid and do so and sin and that they might have matter for an evil report that they might reproach me my god think thou upon tobiah and sanballat accord to these their work and on the prophetess noadiah and the rest of the prophet that would have put me in fear so the wall be finish in the twenty and fifth day of the month elul in fifty and two day and it come to pas that when all our enemy heard thereof and all the heathen that be about u saw these thing they be much cast down in their own eye for they perceive that this work be wrought of our god moreover in those day the noble of judah sent many letter unto tobiah and the letter of tobiah come unto them for there be many in judah sworn unto him because he be the son in law of shechaniah the son of arah and his son johanan have take the daughter of meshullam the son of berechiah also they report his good deed before me and uttered my word to him and tobiah sent letter to put me in fear now it come to pas when the wall be built and have set up the door and the porter and the singer and the levite be appoint that give my brother hanani and hananiah the ruler of the palace charge over jerusalem for he be faithful man and fear god above many and say unto them let not the gate of jerusalem be open until the sun be hot and while they stand by let them shut the door and bar them and appoint watch of the inhabitant of jerusalem every one in his watch and every one to be over against his house now the city be large and great but

morning and try him every moment how long wilt thou not depart from me nor let me alone till swallow down my spittle have sin what shall do unto thee thou preserver of men why hast thou set me a mark against thee so that be burden to myself and why dost thou not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity for now shall sleep in the dust and thou shalt seek me in the morning but shall not be then answer bildad the shuhite and say how long wilt thou speak these thing and how long shall the word of thy mouth be like strong wind doth god pervert judgment or doth the almighty pervert justice

surely now he would awake for thee and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous though thy begin be small yet thy latter end should greatly increase for enquire pray thee of the former age and prepare thyself to the search of their father for we be but of yesterday and know nothing because our day upon earth be shadow shall not they teach thee and tell thee and utter word out of their heart can the rush grow up without mire can the flag grow without water whilst it be yet in his greenness and not cut down it withereth before any other herb so be the path of all that forget god and the hypocrite hope shall perish whose hope shall be cut off and whose trust shall be spider web he shall lean upon his house but it shall not stand he shall hold it fast but it shall not endure he be green before the sun and his branch shooteth forth in his garden his root be wrap about the heap and seeth the place of stone if he destroy him from his place then it shall deny him say have not see thee behold this be the joy of his way and out of the earth shall others grow behold god will not cast away perfect man neither will he help the evil doer till he fill thy mouth with laugh and thy lip with rejoice they that hate thee shall be clothed with shame and the dwell place of the wicked shall come to nought then job answer and say know it be so of truth but how should man be just with god if he will contend with him he cannot answer him one of thousand he be wise in heart and mighty in strength who hath harden himself against him and hath prosper which removeth the mountain and they know not which overturneth them in his anger which shaketh the earth out of her place and the pillar thereof tremble which commandeth the sun and it riseth not and sealeth up the star which alone spreadeth out the heaven and treadeth upon the wave of the sea which maketh arcturus orion and pleiades and the chamber of the south which doeth great thing past find out yea and wonder without number lo he goeth by me and see him not he passeth on also but perceive him not behold he taketh away who can hinder him who will say unto him what doest thou if god will not withdraw his anger the proud helper do stoop under him how much less shall answer him and choose out my word to reason with him whom though be righteous yet would not answer but would make supplication to my judge if have call and he have answer me yet would not believe that he have hearken unto my voice for he breaketh me with tempest and multiplieth my wound without cause he will not suffer me to take my breath but filleth me with bitterness if speak of strength lo he be strong and if of judgment who shall set me time to plead if justify myself mine own mouth shall condemn me if say be perfect it shall also prove me perverse though be perfect yet would not know my soul would despise my life this be one thing therefore say it he destroyeth the perfect and the wicked if the scourge slay suddenly he will laugh at the trial of the innocent the earth be give into the hand of the wicked he covereth the face of the judge thereof if not where and who be he now my day be swifter than post they flee away they see no good they be pass away a the swift ship a the eagle that hasteth to the prey if say will forget my complaint will leave off my heaviness and comfort myself be afraid of all my sorrow know that thou wilt not hold me innocent if be wicked why then labour in vain if wash myself with snow water and make my hand never so clean yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch and mine own clothes shall abhor me for he be not man a be that should answer him and we should come together in judgment neither be there any daysman betwixt u that might lay his hand upon u both let him take his rod away from me and let not his fear terrify me then would speak and not fear him but it be not so with me my soul be weary of my life will leave my complaint upon myself will speak in the bitterness of my soul will say unto god do not condemn me shew me wherefore thou contendest with me be it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hand and shine upon the counsel of the wicked hast thou eye of flesh or seest thou a man seeth be thy day a the day of man be thy year a man day that thou enquirest after mine iniquity and searchest after my sin thou knowest that be not wicked and there be none that can deliver out of thine hand thine hand have make me and fashion me together round about yet thou dost destroy me remember beseech thee that thou hast make me a the clay and wilt thou bring me into dust again hast thou not pour me out a milk and curdle me like cheese thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh and hast fence me with bone and sinew thou hast grant me life and favour and thy visitation hath preserve my spirit and these thing hast thou hid in thine heart know that this be with thee if sin then thou markest me and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity if be wicked woe unto me and if be righteous yet will not lift up my head be full of confusion therefore see thou mine affliction for it increaseth thou huntest me a fierce lion and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me thou renewest thy witness against me and increasest thine indignation upon me change and war be against me wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb oh that have give up the ghost and no eye have see me should have be a though have not be should have be carry from the womb to the grave be not my day few cease then and let me alone that may take comfort little before go whence shall not return even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death land of darkness a darkness itself and of the shadow of death without any order and where the light be a darkness then answer zophar the naamathite and say should not the multitude of word be answer and should man full of talk be justified should thy lie make men hold their peace and when thou mock shall no man make thee ashamed for thou hast say my doctrine be pure and be clean in thine eye but oh that god would speak and open his lip against thee and that he would shew thee the secret of wisdom that they be double to that which be know therefore that god exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth canst thou by search find out god canst thou find out the almighty unto perfection it be a high a heaven what canst thou do deeper than hell what canst thou know the measure thereof be longer than the earth and broader than the sea if he cut off and shut up or gather together then who can hinder him for he knoweth vain men he seeth wickedness also will he not then consider it for vain men would be wise though man be born like wild as colt if thou prepare thine heart and stretch out thine hand toward him if iniquity be in thine hand put it far away and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacle for then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot yea thou shalt be stedfast and shalt not fear because thou shalt forget thy misery and remember it a water that pas away and thine age shall be clearer than the noonday thou shalt shine forth thou shalt be a the morning and thou shalt be secure because there be hope yea thou shalt dig about thee and thou shalt take thy rest in safety also thou shalt lie down and none shall make thee afraid yea many shall make suit unto thee but the eye of the wicked shall fail and they shall not escape and their hope shall be a the give up of the ghost and job answer and say no doubt but ye be the people and wisdom shall die with you but have understand a well a you be not inferior to you yea who knoweth not such thing a these be a one mocked of his neighbour who calleth upon god and he answereth him the just upright man be laugh to scorn he that be ready to slip with his foot be a lamp despise in the thought of him that be at ease the tabernacle of robber prosper and they that provoke god be secure into whose hand god bringeth abundantly but ask now the beast and they shall teach thee and the fowl of the air and they shall tell thee or speak to the earth and it shall teach thee and the fish of the sea shall declare unto thee who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the lord hath wrought this in whose hand be the soul of every living thing and the breath of all mankind doth not the ear try word and the mouth taste his meat with the ancient be wisdom and in length of day understand with him be wisdom and strength he hath counsel and understand behold he breaketh down and it cannot be built again he shutteth up man and there can be no opening behold he withholdeth the water and they dry up also he sendeth them out and they overturn the earth with him be strength and wisdom the deceive and the deceiver be his he leadeth counsellor away spoil and maketh the judge fool he looseth the bond of king and girdeth their loin with girdle he leadeth prince away spoil and overthroweth the mighty he removeth away the speech of the trusty and taketh away the understand of the age he poureth contempt upon prince and weakeneth the strength of the mighty he discovereth deep thing out of darkness and bringeth out to light the shadow of death he increaseth the nation and destroyeth them he enlargeth the nation and straiteneth them again he taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth and causeth them to wander in wilderness where there be no way they grope in the dark without light and he maketh them to stagger like drunken man lo mine eye hath see all this mine ear hath heard and understood it what ye know the same do know also be not inferior unto you surely would speak to the almighty and desire to reason with god but ye be forger of lie ye be all physician of no value that ye would altogether hold your peace and it should be your wisdom hear now my reason and hearken to the pleading of my lip will ye speak wickedly for god and talk deceitfully for him will ye accept his person will ye contend for god be it good that he should search you out or a one man mocketh another do ye so mock him he will surely reprove you if ye do secretly accept person shall not his excellency make you afraid and his dread fall upon you your remembrance be like unto ash your body to body of clay hold your peace let me alone that may speak and let come on me what will wherefore do take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in mine hand though he slay me yet will trust in him but will maintain mine own way before him he also shall be my salvation for an hypocrite shall not come before him hear diligently my speech and my declaration with your ear behold now have order my cause know that shall be justified who be he that will plead with me for now if hold my tongue shall give up the ghost only do not two thing unto me then will not hide myself from thee withdraw thine hand far from me and let not thy dread make me afraid then call thou and will answer or let me speak and answer thou me how many be mine iniquity and sin make me to know my transgression and my sin wherefore hidest thou thy face and holdest me for thine enemy wilt thou break leaf driven to and fro and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble for thou writest bitter thing against me and makest me to posse the iniquity of my youth thou puttest my foot also in the stock and lookest narrowly unto all my path thou settest print upon the heel of my foot and he a rotten thing consumeth a garment that be moth eat man that be born of woman be of few day and full of trouble he cometh forth like flower and be cut down he fleeth also a shadow and continueth not and doth thou open thine eye upon such an one and bringest me into judgment with thee who can bring clean thing out of an unclean not one see his day be determine the number of his month be with thee thou hast appoint his bound that he cannot pas turn from him that he may rest till he shall accomplish a an hireling his day for there be hope of tree if it be cut down that it will sprout again and that the tender branch thereof will not cease though the root thereof wax old in the earth and the stock thereof die in the ground yet through the scent of water it will bud and bring forth bough like plant but man dieth and wasteth away yea man giveth up the ghost and where be he a the water fail from the sea and the flood decayeth and drieth up so man lieth down and riseth not till the heaven be no more they shall not awake nor be raise out of their sleep that thou wouldest hide me in the grave that thou wouldest keep me secret until thy wrath be past that thou wouldest appoint me set time and remember me if man die shall he live again all the day of my appoint time will wait till my change come thou shalt call and will answer thee thou wilt have desire to the work of thine hand for now thou numb my step dost thou not watch over my sin my transgression be seal up in bag and thou sewest up mine iniquity and surely the mountain fall cometh to nought and the rock be remove out of his place the water wear the stone thou washest away the thing which grow out of the dust of the earth and thou destroyest the hope of man thou prevailest for ever against him and he passeth thou changest his countenance and sendest him away his son come to honour and he knoweth it not and they be brought low but he perceiveth it not of them but his flesh upon him shall have pain and his soul within him shall mourn then answer eliphaz the temanite and say should wise man utter vain knowledge and fill his belly with the east wind should he reason with unprofitable talk or with speech wherewith he can do no good yea thou castest off fear and restrainest prayer before god for thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty thine own mouth condemneth thee and not yea thine own lip testify against thee art thou the first man that be born or wast thou make before the hill hast thou heard the secret of god and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself what knowest thou that we know not what understandest thou which be not in u with u be both the grayheaded and very age men much elder than thy father be the consolation of god small with thee be there any secret thing with thee why doth thine heart carry thee away and what do thy eye wink at that thou turnest thy spirit against god and lettest such word go out of thy mouth what be man that he should be clean and he which be born of woman that he should be righteous behold he putteth no trust in his saint yea the heaven be not clean in his sight how much more abominable and filthy be man which drinketh iniquity like water will shew thee hear me and that which have see will declare which wise men have told from their father and have not hid it unto whom alone the earth be give and no stranger pass among them the wicked man travaileth with pain all his day and the number of year be hidden to the oppressor dreadful sound be in his ear in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him he believeth not that he shall return out of darkness and he be wait for of the sword he wandereth abroad for bread say where be it he knoweth that the day of darkness be ready at his hand trouble and anguish shall make him afraid they shall prevail against him a king ready to the battle for he stretcheth out his hand against god and strengtheneth himself against the almighty he runneth upon him even on his neck upon the thick boss of his buckler because he covereth his face with his fatness and maketh collops of fat on his flank and he dwelleth in desolate city and in house which no man inhabiteth which be ready to become heap he shall not be rich neither shall his substance continue neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth he shall not depart out of darkness the flame shall dry up his branch and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away let not him that be deceive trust in vanity for vanity shall be his recompence it shall be accomplish before his time and his branch shall not be green he shall shake off his unripe grape a the vine and shall cast off his flower a the olive for the congregation of hypocrite shall be desolate and fire shall consume the tabernacle of bribery they conceive mischief and bring forth vanity and their belly prepareth deceit then job answer and say have heard many such thing miserable comforter be ye all shall vain word have an end or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest also could speak a ye do if your soul be in my soul stead could heap up word against you and shake mine head at you but would strengthen you with my mouth and the move of my lip should asswage your grief though speak my grief be not asswaged and though forbear what be ease but now he hath make me weary thou hast make desolate all my company and thou hast fill me with wrinkle which be witness against me and my leanness rise up in me beareth witness to my face he

me by my neck and shaken me to piece and set me up for his mark his archer compass me round about he cleaveth my rein asunder and doth not spare he poureth out my gall upon the ground he breaketh me with breach upon breach he runneth upon me like giant have sew sackcloth upon my skin and defile my horn in the dust my face be foul with weep and on my eyelid be the shadow of death not for any injustice in mine hand also my prayer be pure earth cover not thou my blood and let my cry have no place also now behold my witness be in heaven and my record be on high my friend scorn me but mine eye poureth out tear unto god that one might plead for man with god a man pleadeth for his neighbour when few year be come then shall go the way whence shall not return my breath be corrupt my day be extinct the graf be ready for me be there not mocker with me and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation lay down now put me in surety with thee who be he that will strike hand with me for

aforetime be a tabret mine eye also be dim by reason of sorrow and all my member be a shadow upright men shall be astonied at this and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite the righteous also shall hold on his way and he that hath clean hand shall be strong and strong but a for you all do ye return and come now for cannot find one wise man among you my day be past my purpose be broken off even the thought of my heart they change the night into day the light be short because of darkness if wait the grave be mine house have make my bed in the darkness have say to corruption thou art my father to the worm thou art my mother and my sister and where be now my hope a for my hope who shall see it they shall go down to the bar of the pit when our rest together be in the dust then answer bildad the shuhite and say how long will it be ere ye make an end of word mark and afterwards we will speak wherefore be we count a beast and repute vile in your sight he teareth himself in his anger shall the earth be forsaken for thee and shall the rock be remove out of his place yea the light of the wicked shall be put out and the spark of his fire shall not shine the light shall be dark in his tabernacle and his candle shall be put out with him the step of his strength shall be straiten and his own counsel shall cast him down for he be cast into net by his own foot and he walketh upon snare the gin shall take him by the heel and the robber shall prevail against him the snare be laid for him in the ground and trap for him in the way terror shall make him afraid on every side and shall drive him to his foot his strength shall be hungerbitten and destruction shall be ready at his side it shall devour the strength of his skin even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength his confidence shall be root out of his tabernacle and it shall bring him to the king of terror it shall dwell in his tabernacle because it be none of his brimstone shall be scatter upon his habitation his root shall be dry up beneath and above shall his branch be cut off his remembrance shall perish from the earth and he shall have no name in the street he shall be driven from light into darkness and chase out of the world he shall neither have son nor nephew among his people nor any remain in his dwelling they that come after him shall be astonied at his day a they that go before be affright surely such be the dwelling of the wicked and this be the place of him that knoweth not god then job answer and say how long will ye vex my soul and break me in piece with word these ten time have ye reproach me ye be not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me and be it indeed that have err mine error remaineth with myself if indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me and plead against me my reproach know now that god hath overthrown me and hath compass me with his net behold cry out of wrong but be not heard cry aloud but there be no judgment he hath fence up my way that cannot pas and he hath set darkness in my path he hath strip me of my glory and take the crown from my head he hath destroyed me on every side and be go and mine hope hath he remove like tree he hath also kindle his wrath against me and he counteth me unto him a one of his enemy his troop come together and raise up their way against me and encamp round about my tabernacle he hath put my brother far from me and mine acquaintance be verily estrange from me my kinsfolk have fail and my familiar friend have forgotten me they that dwell in mine house and my maid count me for stranger be an alien in their sight call my servant and he give me no answer intreated him with my mouth my breath be strange to my wife though intreated for the child sake of mine own body yea young child despise me arose and they spake against me all my inward friend abhor me and they whom love be turn against me my bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh and be escape with the skin of my teeth have pity upon me have pity upon me ye my friend for the hand of god hath touch me why do ye persecute me a god and be not satisfied with my flesh oh that my word be now write oh that they be print in book that they be graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever for know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth and though after my skin worm destroy this body yet in my flesh shall see god whom shall see for myself and mine eye shall behold and not another though my rein be consume within me but ye should say why persecute we him see the root of the matter be found in me be ye afraid of the sword for wrath bringeth the punishment of the sword that ye may know there be judgment then answer zophar the naamathite and say therefore do my thought cause me to answer and for this make haste have heard the check of my reproach and the spirit of my understand causeth me to answer knowest thou not this of old since man be place upon earth that the triumph of the wicked be short and the joy of the hypocrite but for moment though his excellency mount up to the heaven and his head reach unto the cloud yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung they which have see him shall say where be he he shall fly away a dream and shall not be found yea he shall be chase away a vision of the night the eye also which saw him shall see him no more neither shall his place any more behold him his child shall seek to please the poor and his hand shall restore their good his bone be full of the sin of his youth which shall lie down with him in the dust though wickedness be sweet in his mouth though he hide it under his tongue though he spare it and forsake it not but keep it still within his mouth yet his meat in his bowel be turn it be the gall of asp within him he hath swallow down rich and he shall vomit them up again god shall cast them out of his belly he shall suck the poison of asp the viper tongue shall slay him he shall not see the river the flood the brook of honey and butter that which he labour for shall he restore and shall not swallow it down accord to his substance shall the restitution be and he shall not rejoice therein because he hath oppress and hath forsaken the poor because he hath violently take away an house which he build not surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly he shall not save of that which he desire there shall none of his meat be left therefore shall no man look for his good in the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in strait every hand of the wicked shall come upon him when he be about to fill his belly god shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him and shall rain it upon him while he be eat he shall flee from the iron weapon and the bow of steel shall strike him through it be drawn and cometh out of the body yea the glitter sword cometh out of his gall terror be upon him all darkness shall be hid in his secret place fire not blown shall consume him it shall go ill with him that be left in his tabernacle the heaven shall reveal his iniquity and the earth shall rise up against him the increase of his house shall depart and his good shall flow away in the day of his wrath this be the portion of wicked man from god and the heritage appoint unto him by god but job answer and say hear diligently my speech and let this be your consolation suffer me that may speak and after that have spoken mock on a for me be my complaint to man and if it be so why should not my spirit be troubled mark me and be astonish and lay your hand upon your mouth even when remember be afraid and tremble taketh hold on my flesh wherefore do the wicked live become old yea be mighty in power their seed be establish in their sight with them and their offspring before their eye their house be safe from fear neither be the rod of god upon them their bull gendereth and faileth not their cow calveth and casteth not her calf they send forth their little one like flock and their child dance they take the timbrel and harp and rejoice at the sound of the organ they spend their day in wealth and in moment go down to the grave therefore they say unto god depart from u for we desire not the knowledge of thy way what be the almighty that we should serve him and what profit should we have if we pray unto him lo their good be not in their hand the counsel of the wicked be far from me how oft be the candle of the wicked put out and how oft cometh their destruction upon them god distributeth sorrow in his anger they be a stubble before the wind and a chaff that the storm carrieth away god layeth up his iniquity for his child he rewardeth him and he shall know it his eye shall see his destruction and he shall drink of the wrath of the almighty for what pleasure hath he in his house after him when the number of his month be cut off in the midst shall any teach god knowledge see he judgeth those that be high one dieth in his full strength be wholly at ease and quiet his breast be full of milk and his bone be moisten with marrow and another dieth in the bitterness of his soul and never eateth with pleasure they shall lie down alike in the dust and the worm shall cover them behold know your thought and the device which ye wrongfully imagine against me for ye say where be the house of the prince and where be the dwell place of the wicked have ye not ask them that go by the way and do ye not know their token that the wicked be reserve to the day of destruction they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath who shall declare his way to his face and who shall repay him what he hath do yet shall he be brought to the grave and shall remain in the tomb the clod of the valley shall be sweet unto him and every man shall draw after him a there be innumerable before him how then comfort ye me in vain see in your answer there remaineth falsehood then eliphaz the temanite answer and say can man be profitable unto god a he that be wise may be profitable unto himself be it any pleasure to the almighty that thou art righteous or be it gain to him that thou makest thy way perfect will he reprove thee for fear of thee will he enter with thee into judgment be not thy wickedness great and thine iniquity infinite for thou hast take pledge from thy brother for nought and strip the naked of their clothing thou hast not give water to the weary to drink and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry but a for the mighty man he have the earth and the honourable man dwelt in it thou hast sent widow away empty and the arm of the fatherless have be broken therefore snare be round about thee and sudden fear troubleth thee or darkness that thou canst not see and abundance of water cover thee be not god in the height of heaven and behold the height of the star how high they be and thou sayest how doth god know can he judge through the dark cloud thick cloud be cover to him that he seeth not and he walketh in the circuit of heaven hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden which be cut down out of time whose foundation be overflown with flood which say unto god depart from u and what can the almighty do for them yet he fill their house with good thing but the counsel of the wicked be far from me the righteous see it and be glad and the innocent laugh them to scorn whereas our substance be not cut down but the remnant of them the fire consumeth acquaint now thyself with him and be at peace thereby good shall come unto thee receive pray thee the law from his mouth and lay up his word in thine heart if thou return to the almighty thou shalt be built up thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacle then shalt thou lay up gold a dust and the gold of ophir a the stone of the brook yea the almighty shall be thy defence and thou shalt have plenty of silver for then shalt thou have thy delight in the almighty and shalt lift up thy face unto god thou shalt make thy prayer unto him and he shall hear thee and thou shalt pay thy vow thou shalt also decree thing and it shall be establish unto thee and the light shall shine upon thy way when men be cast down then thou shalt say there be lift up and he shall save the humble person he shall deliver the island of the innocent and it be deliver by the pureness of thine hand then job answer and say even to day be my complaint bitter my stroke be heavier than my groan oh that knew where might find him that might come even to his seat would order my cause before him and fill my mouth with argument would know the word which he would answer me and understand what he would say unto me will he plead against me with his great power no but he would put strength in me there the righteous might dispute with him so should be deliver for ever from my judge behold go forward but he be not there and backward but cannot perceive him on the left hand where he doth work but cannot behold him he hideth himself on the right hand that cannot see him but he knoweth the way that take when he hath try me shall come forth a gold my foot hath held his step his way have kept and not decline neither have go back from the commandment of his lip have esteem the word of his mouth more than my necessary food but he be in one mind and who can turn him and what his soul desireth even that he doeth for he performeth the thing that be appoint for me and many such thing be with him therefore be troubled at his presence when consider be afraid of him for god maketh my heart soft and the almighty troubleth me because be not cut off before the darkness neither hath he cover the darkness from my face why see time be not hidden from the almighty do they that know him not see his day some remove the landmark they violently take away flock and feed thereof they drive away the as of the fatherless they take the widow ox for pledge they turn the needy out of the way the poor of the earth hide themselves together behold a wild ass in the desert go they forth to their work rise betimes for prey the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their child they reap every one his corn in the field and they gather the vintage of the wicked they cause the naked to lodge without clothing that they have no cover in the cold they be wet with the shower of the mountain and embrace the rock for want of shelter they pluck the fatherless from the breast and take pledge of the poor they cause him to go naked without clothing and they take away the sheaf from the hungry which make oil within their wall and tread their winepress and suffer thirst men groan from out of the city and the soul of the wound crieth out yet god layeth not folly to them they be of those that rebel against the light they know not the way thereof nor abide in the path thereof the murderer rise with the light killeth the poor and needy and in the night be a thief the eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight say no eye shall see me and disguiseth his face in the dark they dig through house which they have marked for themselves in the daytime they know not the light for the morning be to them even a the shadow of death if one know them they be in the terror of the shadow of death he be swift a the water their portion be curse in the earth he beholdeth not the way of the vineyard drought and heat consume the snow water so doth the grave those which have sin the womb shall forget him

thunder of his power who can understand moreover job continued his parable and say a god liveth who hath take away my judgment and the almighty who hath vexed my soul all the while my breath be in me and the spirit of god be in my nostril my lip shall not speak wickedness nor my tongue utter deceit god forbid that should justify you till die will not remove mine integrity from me my righteousness hold fast and will not let it go my heart shall not reproach me so long a live let mine enemy be a the wicked and he that riseth up against me a the unrighteous for what be the hope of the hypocrite though he hath gain when god taketh away his soul will god hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him will he delight himself in the almighty will he always call upon god will teach you by the hand of god that which be with the almighty will not conceal behold all ye yourselves have see it why then be ye thus altogether vain this be the portion of wicked man with god and the heritage of oppressor which they shall receive of the almighty if his child be multiply it be for the sword and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread those that remain of him shall be bury in death and his widow

east wind carrieth him away and he departeth and a storm hurleth him out of his place for god shall cast upon him and not spare he would fain flee out of his hand men shall clap their hand at him and shall hiss him out of his place surely there be vein for the silver and place for gold where they fine it iron be take out of the earth and brass be molten out of the stone he setteth an end to darkness and searcheth out all perfection the stone of darkness and the shadow of death the flood breaketh out from the inhabitant even the water forgotten of the foot they be dry up they be go away from men a for the earth out of it cometh bread and under it be turn up a it be fire the stone of it be the place of sapphire and it hath dust of gold there be path which no fowl knoweth and which the vulture eye hath not see the lion whelp have not trodden it nor the fierce lion pass by it he putteth forth his hand upon the rock he overturneth the mountain by the root he cutteth out river among the rock and his eye seeth every precious thing he bindeth the flood from overflow and the thing that be hid bringeth he forth to light but where shall wisdom be found and where be the place of understand man knoweth not the price thereof neither be it found in the land of the living the depth saith it be not in me and the sea saith it be not with me it cannot be gotten for gold neither shall silver be weigh for the price thereof it cannot be value with the gold of ophir with the precious onyx or the sapphire the gold and the crystal cannot equal it and the exchange of it shall not be for jewel of fine gold no mention shall be make of coral or of pearl for the price of wisdom be above ruby the topaz of ethiopia shall not equal it neither shall it be value with pure gold whence then cometh wisdom and where be the place of understand see it be hid from the eye of all living and kept close from the fowl of the air destruction and death say we have heard the fame thereof with our ear god understandeth the way thereof and he knoweth the place thereof for he looketh to the end of the earth and seeth under the whole heaven to make the weight for the wind and he weigheth the water by measure when he make decree for the rain and way for the lightning of the thunder then do he see it and declare it he prepared it yea and search it out and unto man he say behold the fear of the lord that be wisdom and to depart from evil be understand moreover job continued his parable and say oh that be a in month past a in the day when god preserve me when his candle shin upon my head and when by his light walk through darkness a be in the day of my youth when the secret of god be upon my tabernacle when the almighty be yet with me when my child be about me when wash my step with butter and the rock pour me out river of oil when go out to the gate through the city when prepared my seat in the street the young men saw me and hid themselves and the age arose and stood up the prince refrain talk and laid their hand on their mouth the noble held their peace and their tongue cleave to the roof of their mouth when the ear heard me then it bless me and when the eye saw me it give witness to me because deliver the poor that cry and the fatherless and him that have none to help him the blessing of him that be ready to perish come upon me and cause the widow heart to sing for joy put on righteousness and it clothed me my judgment be a robe and diadem be eye to the blind and foot be to the lame be father to the poor and the cause which knew not search out and brake the jaw of the wicked and plucked the spoil out of his teeth then say shall die in my nest and shall multiply my day a the sand my root be spread out by the water and the dew lay all night upon my branch my glory be fresh in me and my bow be renew in my hand unto me men give ear and wait and kept silence at my counsel after my word they spake not again and my speech drop upon them and they wait for me a for the rain and they open their mouth wide a for the latter rain if laugh on them they believe it not and the light of my countenance they cast not down chose out their way and sat chief and dwelt a king in the army a one that comforteth the mourner but now they that be young than have me in derision whose father would have disdain to have set with the dog of my flock yea whereto might the strength of their hand profit me in whom old age be perish for want and famine they be solitary flee into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste who cut up mallow by the bush and juniper root for their meat they be driven forth from among men they cry after them a after thief to dwell in the cliff of the valley in cave of the earth and in the rock among the bush they brayed under the nettle they be gather together they be child of fool yea child of base men they be viler than the earth and now be their song yea be their byword they abhor me they flee far from me and spare not to spit in my face because he hath loose my cord and afflict me they have also let loose the bridle before me upon my right hand rise the youth they push away my foot and they raise up against me the way of their destruction they mar my path they set forward my calamity they have no helper they come upon me a wide break in of water in the desolation they roll themselves upon me terror be turn upon me they pursue my soul a the wind and my welfare passeth away a cloud and now my soul be pour out upon me the day of affliction have take hold upon me my bone be pierce in me in the night season and my sinew take no rest by the great force of my disease be my garment change it bindeth me about a the collar of my coat he hath cast me into the mire and be become like dust and ash cry unto thee and thou dost not hear me stand up and thou regardest me not thou art become cruel to me with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me thou liftest me up to the wind thou causest me to ride upon it and dissolvest my substance for know that thou wilt bring me to death and to the house appoint for all living howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave though they cry in his destruction do not weep for him that be in trouble be not my soul grieve for the poor when look for good then evil come unto me and when wait for light there come darkness my bowel boil and rest not the day of affliction prevent me go mourn without the sun stood up and cry in the congregation be brother to dragon and companion to owl my skin be black upon me and my bone be burn with heat my harp also be turn to mourn and my organ into the voice of them that weep make covenant with mine eye why then should think upon maid for what portion of god be there from above and what inheritance of the almighty from on high be not destruction to the wicked and strange punishment to the worker of iniquity doth not he see my way and count all my step if have walk with vanity or if my foot hath hasted to deceit let me be weigh in an even balance that god may know mine integrity if my step hath turn out of the way and mine heart walk after mine eye and if any blot hath cleave to mine hand then let me sow and let another eat yea let my offspring be root out if mine heart have be deceive by woman or if have laid wait at my neighbour door then let my wife grind unto another and let others bow down upon her for this be an heinous crime yea it be an iniquity to be punish by the judge for it be fire that consumeth to destruction and would root out all mine increase if do despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant when they contend with me what then shall do when god riseth up and when he visiteth what shall answer him do not he that make me in the womb make him and do not one fashion u in the womb if have withheld the poor from their desire or have cause the eye of the widow to fail or have eat my morsel myself alone and the fatherless hath not eat thereof for from my youth he be brought up with me a with father and have guide her from my mother womb if have see any perish for want of clothing or any poor without cover if his loin have not bless me and if he be not warm with the fleece of my sheep if have lift up my hand against the fatherless when saw my help in the gate then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade and mine arm be broken from the bone for destruction from god be terror to me and by reason of his highness could not endure if have make gold my hope or have say to the fine gold thou art my confidence if rejoice because my wealth be great and because mine hand have gotten much if beheld the sun when it shin or the moon walk in brightness and my heart hath be secretly entice or my mouth hath kiss my hand this also be an iniquity to be punish by the judge for should have deny the god that be above if rejoice at the destruction of him that hat me or lift up myself when evil found him neither have suffer my mouth to sin by wish curse to his soul if the men of my tabernacle say not oh that we have of his flesh we cannot be satisfied the stranger do not lodge in the street but open my door to the traveller if cover my transgression a adam by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom do fear great multitude or do the contempt of family terrify me that kept silence and go not out of the door oh that one would hear me behold my desire be that the almighty would answer me and that mine adversary have write book surely would take it upon my shoulder and bind it a crown to me would declare unto him the number of my step a prince would go near unto him if my land cry against me or that the furrow likewise thereof complain if have eat the fruit thereof without money or have cause the owner thereof to lose their life let thistle grow instead of wheat and cockle instead of barley the word of job be end so these three men cease to answer job because he be righteous in his own eye then be kindle the wrath of elihu the son of barachel the buzite of the kindred of ram against job be his wrath kindle because he justified himself rather than god also against his three friend be his wrath kindle because they have found no answer and yet have condemn job now elihu have wait till job have spoken because they be elder than he when elihu saw that there be no answer in the mouth of these three men then his wrath be kindle and elihu the son of barachel the buzite answer and say be young and ye be very old wherefore be afraid and durst not shew you mine opinion say day should speak and multitude of year should teach wisdom but there be spirit in man and the inspiration of the almighty giveth them understand great men be not always wise neither do the age understand judgment therefore say hearken to me also will shew mine opinion behold wait for your word give ear to your reason whilst ye search out what to say yea attend unto you and behold there be none of you that convince job or that answer his word l ye should say we have found out wisdom god thrusteth him down not man now he hath not direct his word against me neither will answer him with your speech they be amaze they answer no more they left off speak when have wait for they spake not but stood still and answer no more say will answer also my part also will shew mine opinion for be full of matter the spirit within me constraineth me behold my belly be a wine which hath no vent it be ready to burst like new bottle will speak that may be refresh will open my lip and answer let me not pray you accept any man person neither let me give flatter title unto man for know not to give flatter title in so do my maker would soon take me away wherefore job pray thee hear my speech and hearken to all my word behold now have open my mouth my tongue hath spoken in my mouth my word shall be of the uprightness of my heart and my lip shall utter knowledge clearly the spirit of god hath make me and the breath of the almighty hath give me life if thou canst answer me set thy word in order before me stand up behold be accord to thy wish in god stead also be form out of the clay behold my terror shall not make thee afraid neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing and have heard the voice of thy word say be clean without transgression be innocent neither be there iniquity in me behold he findeth occasion against me he counteth me for his enemy he putteth my foot in the stock he marketh all my path behold in this thou art not just will answer thee that god be great than man why dost thou strive against him for he giveth not account of any of his matter for god speaketh once yea twice yet man perceiveth it not in dream in vision of the night when deep sleep falleth upon men in slumberings upon the bed then he openeth the ear of men and sealeth their instruction that he may withdraw man from his purpose and hide pride from man he keepeth back his soul from the pit and his life from perish by the sword he be chasten also with pain upon his bed and the multitude of his bone with strong pain so that his life abhorreth bread and his soul dainty meat his flesh be consume away that it cannot be see and his bone that be not see stick out yea his soul draweth near unto the grave and his life to the destroyer if there be messenger with him an interpreter one among thousand to shew unto man his uprightness then he be gracious unto him and saith deliver him from go down to the pit have found ransom his flesh shall be fresher than child he shall return to the day of his youth he shall pray unto god and he will be favourable unto him and he shall see his face with joy for he will render unto man his righteousness he looketh upon men and if any say have sin and pervert that which be right and it profit me not he will deliver his soul from go into the pit and his life shall see the light lo all these thing worketh god oftentimes with man to bring back his soul from the pit to be enlighten with the light of the living mark well job hearken unto me hold thy peace and will speak if thou hast anything to say answer me speak for desire to justify thee if not hearken unto me hold thy peace and shall teach thee wisdom furthermore elihu answer and say hear my word ye wise men and give ear unto me ye that have knowledge for the ear trieth word a the mouth tasteth meat let u choose to u judgment let u know among ourselves what be good for job hath say be righteous and god hath take away my judgment should lie against my right my wound be incurable without transgression what man be like job who drinketh up scorn like water which goeth in company with the worker of iniquity and walketh with wicked men for he hath say it profiteth man nothing that he should delight himself with god therefore hearken unto me ye men of understand far be it from god that he should do wickedness and from the almighty that he should commit iniquity for the work of man shall he render unto him and cause every man to find accord to his way yea surely god will not do wickedly neither will the almighty pervert judgment who hath give him charge over the earth or who hath dispose the whole world if he set his heart upon man if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath all flesh shall perish together and man shall turn again unto dust if now thou hast understand hear this hearken to the voice of my word shall even he that hateth right govern and wilt thou condemn him that be most just be it fit to say to king thou art wicked and to prince ye be ungodly how much less to him that accepteth not the person of prince nor regardeth the rich more than the poor for they all be the work of his hand in moment shall they die and the people shall be troubled at midnight and pas away and the mighty shall be take away without hand for his eye be upon the way of man and he seeth all his going there be no darkness nor shadow of death where the worker of iniquity may hide themselves for he will not lay upon man more than right that he should enter into judgment with god he shall break in piece mighty men without number and set others in their stead therefore he knoweth their work and he overturneth them in the night so that they be destroyed he striketh them a wicked men in the open sight of others because they turn back from him and would not consider any of his way so that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him and he heareth the cry of the afflict when he giveth quietness who then can make trouble and when he hideth his face who then can behold him whether it be do against nation or against man only that the hypocrite reign not l the people be ensnare surely it be meet to be say unto god have borne chastisement will not offend any more that which see not teach thou me if have do iniquity will do no more should it be accord to thy mind he will recompense it whether thou refuse or whether thou choose and not therefore speak what thou knowest let men of understand tell me and let wise man hearken unto me job hath spoken without knowledge and his word be without wisdom my desire be that job may be try unto the end because of his answer for wicked men for he addeth rebellion unto his sin he clappeth his hand among u and multiplieth his word against god elihu spake moreover and say thinkest thou this to be right that thou saidst my righteousness be more than god for thou saidst what advantage will it be unto thee and what profit shall have if be cleanse from my sin will answer thee and thy companion with thee look unto the heaven and see and behold the cloud which be high than thou if thou sinnest what doest thou against him or if thy transgression be multiply what doest thou unto him if thou be righteous what givest thou him or what receiveth he of thine hand thy wickedness may hurt man a thou art and thy righteousness may profit the son of man by reason of the multitude of oppression they make the oppress to cry they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty but none saith where be god my maker who giveth song in the night who teacheth u more than the beast of the earth and maketh u wiser than the fowl of heaven there they cry but none giveth answer because of the pride of evil men surely god will not hear vanity neither will the almighty regard it although thou sayest thou shalt not see him yet judgment be before him therefore trust thou in him but now because it be not so he hath visit in his anger yet he knoweth it not in great extremity therefore doth job open his mouth in vain he multiplieth word without knowledge elihu also proceed and say suffer me little and will shew thee that have yet to speak on god behalf will fetch my knowledge from afar and will ascribe righteousness to my maker for truly my word shall not be false he that be perfect in knowledge be with thee behold god be mighty and despiseth not any he be mighty in strength and wisdom he preserveth not the life of the wicked but giveth right to the poor he withdraweth not his eye from the righteous but with king be they on the throne yea he doth establish them for ever and they be exalt and if they be bound in fetter and be holden in cord of affliction then he sheweth them their work and their transgression that they have exceed he openeth also their ear to discipline and commandeth that they return from iniquity if they obey and serve him they shall spend their day in prosperity and their year in pleasure but if they obey not they shall perish by the sword and they shall die without knowledge but the hypocrite in heart heap up wrath they cry not when he bindeth them they die in youth and their life be among the unclean he delivereth the poor in his affliction and openeth their ear in oppression even so would he have remove thee out of the strait into broad place where there be no straitness and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness but thou hast fulfil the judgment of the wicked judgment and justice take hold on thee because there be wrath beware l he take thee away with his stroke then great ransom cannot deliver thee will he esteem thy rich no not gold nor all the force of strength desire not the night when people be cut off in their place take heed regard not iniquity for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction behold god exalteth by his power who teacheth like him who hath enjoin him his way or who can say thou hast wrought iniquity remember that thou magnify his work which men behold every man may see it man may behold it afar off behold god be great and we know him not neither can the number of his year be search out for he maketh small the drop of water they pour down rain accord to the vapour thereof which the cloud do drop and distil upon man abundantly also can any understand the spreading of the cloud or the noise of his tabernacle behold he spreadeth his light upon it and covereth the bottom of the sea for by them judgeth he the people he giveth meat in abundance with cloud he covereth the light and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt the noise thereof sheweth concern it the cattle also concern the vapour at this also my heart trembleth and be move out of his place hear attentively the noise of his voice and the sound that goeth out of his mouth he directeth it under the whole heaven and his lightning unto the end of the earth after it voice roareth he thundereth with the voice of his excellency and he will not stay them when his voice be heard god thundereth marvellously with his voice great thing doeth he which we cannot comprehend for he saith to the snow be thou on the earth likewise to the small rain and to the great rain of his strength he sealeth up the hand of every man that all men may know his work then the beast go into den and remain in their place out of the south cometh the whirlwind and cold out of the north by the breath of god frost be give and the breadth of the water be straiten also by water he wearieth the thick cloud he scattereth his bright cloud and it be turn round about by his counsel that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth he causeth it to come whether for correction or for his land or for mercy hearken unto this job stand still and consider the wondrous work of god dost thou know when god dispose them and cause the light of his cloud to shine dost thou know the balancing of the cloud the wondrous work of him which be perfect in knowledge how thy garment be warm when he quieteth the earth by the south wind hast thou with him spread out the sky which be strong and a molten look glass teach u what we shall say unto him for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness shall it be told him that speak if man speak surely he shall be swallow up and now men see not the bright light which be in the cloud but the wind passeth and cleanseth them fair weather cometh out of the north with god be terrible majesty touch the almighty we cannot find him out he be excellent in power and in judgment and in plenty of justice he will not afflict men do therefore fear him he respecteth not any that be wise of heart then the lord answer job out of the whirlwind and say who be this that darkeneth counsel by word without knowledge gird up now thy loin like man for will demand of thee and answer thou me where wast thou when laid the foundation of the earth declare if thou hast understand who hath laid the measure thereof if thou knowest or who hath stretch the line upon it whereupon be the foundation thereof fasten or who laid the corner stone thereof when the morning star sang together and all the son of god shout for joy or who shut up the sea with door when it brake forth a if it have issue out of the womb when make the cloud the garment thereof and thick darkness swaddlingband for it and brake up for it my decreed place and set bar and door and say hitherto shalt thou come but no far and here shall thy proud wave be stayed hast thou command the morning since thy day and cause the dayspring to know his place that it might take hold of the end of the earth that the wicked might be shaken out of it it be turn a clay to the seal and they stand a garment and from the wicked their light be withholden and the high arm shall be broken hast thou enter into the spring of the sea or hast thou walk in the search of the depth have the gate of death be open unto thee or hast thou see the door of the shadow of death hast thou perceive the breadth of the earth declare if thou knowest it all where be the way where light dwelleth and a for darkness where be the place thereof that thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof and that thou shouldest know the path to the house thereof knowest thou it because thou wast then born or because the number of thy day be great hast thou enter into the treasure of the snow or hast thou see the treasure of the hail which have reserve against the time of trouble against the day of battle and war by what way be the light part which scattereth the east wind upon the earth who hath divide watercourse for the overflow of water or way for the lightning of thunder to cause it to rain on the earth where no man be on the wilderness wherein there be no man to satisfy the desolate and waste ground and to cause the bud of the tender herb to

them all favour be deceitful and beauty be vain but woman that feareth the lord she shall be praise give her of the fruit of her hand and let her own work praise her in the gate book ecclesiastes the word of the preacher the son of david king in jerusalem vanity of vanity saith the preacher vanity of vanity all be vanity what profit hath man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun one generation passeth away and another generation cometh but the earth abideth for ever the sun also ariseth and the sun goeth down and hasteth to his place where he arose the wind goeth toward the south and turneth about unto the north it whirleth about continually and the wind returneth again accord to his circuit all the river run into the sea yet the sea be not full unto the place from whence the river come thither they return again all thing be full of labour man cannot utter it the eye be not satisfied with see nor the ear fill with hearing the thing that hath be it be that which shall be and that which be do be that which shall be do and there be no new thing under the sun be there any thing whereof it may be say see this be new it hath be already of old time which be before u there be no remembrance of former thing neither shall there be any remembrance of thing that be to come with those that shall come after the preacher be king over israel in jerusalem and give my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concern all thing that be do under heaven this sore travail hath god give to the son of man to be exercise therewith have see all the work that be do under the sun and behold all be vanity and vexation of spirit that which be crooked cannot be make straight and that which be want cannot be numbered commune with mine own heart say lo be come to great estate and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have be before me in jerusalem yea my heart have great experience of wisdom and knowledge and give my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly perceive that this also be vexation of spirit for in much wisdom be much grief and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow say in mine heart go to now will prove thee with mirth therefore enjoy pleasure and behold this also be vanity say of laughter it be mad and of mirth what doeth it sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine yet acquaint mine heart with wisdom and to lay hold on folly till might see what be that good for the son of men which they should do under the heaven all the day of their life make me great work build me house plant me vineyard make me garden and orchard and plant tree in them of all kind of fruit make me pool of water to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth tree get me servant and maiden and have servant born in my house also have great possession of great and small cattle above all that be in jerusalem before me gather me also silver and gold and the peculiar treasure of king and of the province gat me men singer and woman singer and the delight of the son of men a musical instrument and that of all sort so be great and increase more than all that be before me in jerusalem also my wisdom remain with me and whatsoever mine eye desire kept not from them withheld not my heart from any joy for my heart rejoice in all my labour and this be my portion of all my labour then look on all the work that my hand have wrought and on the labour that have labour to do and behold all be vanity and vexation of spirit and there be no profit under the sun and turn myself to behold wisdom and madness and folly for what can the man do that cometh after the king even that which hath be already do then saw that wisdom excelleth folly a far a light excelleth darkness the wise man eye be in his head but the fool walketh in darkness and myself perceive also that one event happeneth to them all then say in my heart a it happeneth to the fool so it happeneth even to me and why be then more wise then say in my heart that this also be vanity for there be no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever see that which now be in the day to come shall all be forgotten and how dieth the wise man a the fool therefore hat life because the work that be wrought under the sun be grievous unto me for all be vanity and vexation of spirit yea hat all my labour which have take under the sun because should leave it unto the man that shall be after me and who knoweth whether he shall be wise man or fool yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein have labour and wherein have shew myself wise under the sun this be also vanity therefore go about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which take under the sun for there be man whose labour be in wisdom and in knowledge and in equity yet to man that hath not labour therein shall he leave it for his portion this also be vanity and great evil for what hath man of all his labour and of the vexation of his heart wherein he hath labour under the sun for all his day be sorrow and his travail grief yea his heart taketh not rest in the night this be also vanity there be nothing well for man than that he should eat and drink and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour this also saw that it be from the hand of god for who can eat or who else can hasten hereunto more than for god giveth to man that be good in his sight wisdom and knowledge and joy but to the sinner he giveth travail to gather and to heap up that he may give to him that be good before god this also be vanity and vexation of spirit to every thing there be season and time to every purpose under the heaven time to be born and time to die time to plant and time to pluck up that which be plant time to kill and time to heal time to break down and time to build up time to weep and time to laugh time to mourn and time to dance time to cast away stone and time to gather stone together time to embrace and time to refrain from embrace time to get and time to lose time to keep and time to cast away time to rend and time to sew time to keep silence and time to speak time to love and time to hate time of war and time of peace what profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth have see the travail which god hath give to the son of men to be exercise in it he hath make every thing beautiful in his time also he hath set the world in their heart so that no man can find out the work that god maketh from the begin to the end know that there be no good in them but for man to rejoice and to do good in his life and also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labour it be the gift of god know that whatsoever god doeth it shall be for ever nothing can be put to it nor any thing take from it and god doeth it that men should fear before him that which hath be be now and that which be to be hath already be and god requireth that which be past and moreover saw under the sun the place of judgment that wickedness be there and the place of righteousness that iniquity be there say in mine heart god shall judge the righteous and the wicked for there be time there for every purpose and for every work say in mine heart concern the estate of the son of men that god might manifest them and that they might see that they themselves be beast for that which befalleth the son of men befalleth beast even one thing befalleth them a the one dieth so dieth the other yea they have all one breath so that man hath no preeminence above beast for all be vanity all go unto one place all be of the dust and all turn to dust again who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth wherefore perceive that there be nothing well than that man should rejoice in his own work for that be his portion for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him so return and consider all the oppression that be do under the sun and behold the tear of such a be oppress and they have no comforter and on the side of their oppressor there be power but they have no comforter wherefore praise the dead which be already dead more than the living which be yet alive yea well be he than both they which hath not yet be who hath not see the evil work that be do under the sun again consider all travail and every right work that for this man be envy of his neighbour this be also vanity and vexation of spirit the fool foldeth his hand together and eateth his own flesh well be an handful with quietness than both the hand full with travail and vexation of spirit then return and saw vanity under the sun there be one alone and there be not second yea he hath neither child nor brother yet be there no end of all his labour neither be his eye satisfied with rich neither saith he for whom do labour and bereave my soul of good this be also vanity yea it be sore travail two be well than one because they have good reward for their labour for if they fall the one will lift up his fellow but woe to him that be alone when he falleth for he hath not another to help him up again if two lie together then they have heat but how can one be warm alone and if one prevail against him two shall withstand him and threefold cord be not quickly broken well be poor and wise child than an old and foolish king who will no more be admonish for out of prison he cometh to reign whereas also he that be born in his kingdom becometh poor consider all the living which walk under the sun with the second child that shall stand up in his stead there be no end of all the people even of all that have be before them they also that come after shall not rejoice in him surely this also be vanity and vexation of spirit keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of god and be more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fool for they consider not that they do evil be not rash with thy mouth and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before god for god be in heaven and thou upon earth therefore let thy word be few for dream cometh through the multitude of business and fool voice be know by multitude of word when thou vowest vow unto god defer not to pay it for he hath no pleasure in fool pay that which thou hast vowed well be it that thou shouldest not vow than that thou shouldest vow and not pay suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin neither say thou before the angel that it be an error wherefore should god be angry at thy voice and destroy the work of thine hand for in the multitude of dream and many word there be also diver vanity but fear thou god if thou seest the oppression of the poor and violent pervert of judgment and justice in province marvel not at the matter for he that be high than the high regardeth and there be high than they moreover the profit of the earth be for all the king himself be serve by the field he that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver nor he that loveth abundance with increase this be also vanity when good increase they be increase that eat them and what good be there to the owner thereof save the beholding of them with their eye the sleep of labour man be sweet whether he eat little or much but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep there be sore evil which have see under the sun namely rich kept for the owner thereof to their hurt but those rich perish by evil travail and he begetteth son and there be nothing in his hand a he come forth of his mother womb naked shall he return to go a he come and shall take nothing of his labour which he may carry away in his hand and this also be sore evil that in all point a he come so shall he go and what profit hath he that hath labour for the wind all his day also he eateth in darkness and he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness behold that which have see it be good and comely for one to eat and to drink and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the day of his life which god giveth him for it be his portion every man also to whom god hath give rich and wealth and hath give him power to eat thereof and to take his portion and to rejoice in his labour this be the gift of god for he shall not much remember the day of his life because god answereth him in the joy of his heart there be an evil which have see under the sun and it be common among men man to whom god hath give rich wealth and honour so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth yet god giveth him not power to eat thereof but stranger eateth it this be vanity and it be an evil disease if man beget an hundred child and live many year so that the day of his year be many and his soul be not fill with good and also that he have no burial say that an untimely birth be well than he for he cometh in with vanity and departeth in darkness and his name shall be cover with darkness moreover he hath not see the sun nor know any thing this hath more rest than the other yea though he live thousand year twice told yet hath he see no good do not all go to one place all the labour of man be for his mouth and yet the appetite be not fill for what hath the wise more than the fool what hath the poor that knoweth to walk before the living well be the sight of the eye than the wander of the desire this be also vanity and vexation of spirit that which hath be be name already and it be know that it be man neither may he contend with him that be mightier than he see there be many thing that increase vanity what be man the well for who knoweth what be good for man in this life all the day of his vain life which he spendeth a shadow for who can tell man what shall be after him under the sun good name be well than precious ointment and the day of death than the day of one birth it be well to go to the house of mourn than to go to the house of feast for that be the end of all men and the living will lay it to his heart sorrow be well than laughter for by the sadness of the countenance the heart be make well the heart of the wise be in the house of mourn but the heart of fool be in the house of mirth it be well to hear the rebuke of the wise than for man to hear the song of fool for a the crackle of thorn under pot so be the laughter of the fool this also be vanity surely oppression maketh wise man mad and gift destroyeth the heart well be the end of thing than the begin thereof and the patient in spirit be well than the proud in spirit be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry for anger resteth in the bosom of fool say not thou what be the cause that the former day be well than these for thou dost not enquire wisely concern this wisdom be good with an inheritance and by it there be profit to them that see the sun for wisdom be defence and money be defence but the excellency of knowledge be that wisdom giveth life to them that have it consider the work of god for who can make that straight which he hath make crooked in the day of prosperity be joyful but in the day of adversity consider god also hath set the one over against the other to the end that man should find nothing after him all thing have see in the day of my vanity there be just man that perisheth in his righteousness and there be wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness be not righteous over much neither make thyself over wise why shouldest thou destroy thyself be not over much wicked neither be thou foolish why shouldest thou die before thy time it be good that thou shouldest take hold of this yea also from this withdraw not thine hand for he that feareth god shall come forth of them all wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which be in the city for there be not just man upon earth that doeth good and sinneth not also take no heed unto all word that be spoken l thou hear thy servant curse thee for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast curse others all this have prove by wisdom say will be wise but it be far from me that which be far off and exceed deep who can find it out apply mine heart to know and to search and to seek out wisdom and the reason of thing and to know the wickedness of folly even of foolishness and madness and find more bitter than death the woman whose heart be snare and net and her hand a band whoso pleaseth god shall escape from her but the sinner shall be take by her behold this have found saith the preacher counting one by one to find out the account which yet my soul seeketh but find not one man among thousand have found but woman among all those have not found lo this only have found that god hath make man upright but they have sought out many invention who be a the wise man and who knoweth the interpretation of thing man wisdom maketh his face to shine and the boldness of his face shall be change counsel thee to keep the king commandment and that in regard of the oath of god be not hasty to go out of his sight stand not in an evil thing for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him where the word of king be there be power and who may say unto him what doest thou whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing and wise man heart discerneth both time and judgment because to every purpose there be time and judgment therefore the misery of man be great upon him for he knoweth not that which shall be for who can tell him when it shall be there be no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit neither hath he power in the day of death and there be no discharge in that war neither shall wickedness deliver those that be give to it all this have see and apply my heart unto every work that be do under the sun there be time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt and so saw the wicked bury who have come and go from the place of the holy and they be forgotten in the city where they have so do this be also vanity because sentence against an evil work be not execute speedily therefore the heart of the son of men be fully set in them to do evil though sinner do evil an hundred time and his day be prolong yet surely know that it shall be well with them that fear god which fear before him but it shall not be well with the wicked neither shall he prolong his day which be a shadow because he feareth not before god there be vanity which be do upon the earth that there be just men unto whom it happeneth accord to the work of the wicked again there be wicked men to whom it happeneth accord to the work of the righteous say that this also be vanity then commend mirth because man hath no well thing under the sun than to eat and to drink and to be merry for that shall abide with him of his labour the day of his life which god giveth him under the sun when apply mine heart to know wisdom and to see the business that be do upon the earth for also there be that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eye then beheld all the work of god that man cannot find out the work that be do under the sun because though man labour to seek it out yet he shall not find it yea farther though wise man think to know it yet shall he not be able to find it for all this consider in my heart even to declare all this that the righteous and the wise and their work be in the hand of god no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that be before them all thing come alike to all there be one event to the righteous and to the wicked to the good and to the clean and to the unclean to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not a be the good so be the sinner and he that sweareth a he that feareth an oath this be an evil among all thing that be do under the sun that there be one event unto all yea also the heart of the son of men be full of evil and madness be in their heart while they live and after that they go to the dead for to him that be join to all the living there be hope for living dog be well than dead lion for the living know that they shall die but the dead know not any thing neither have they any more reward for the memory of them be forgotten also their love and their hatred and their envy be now perish neither have they any more portion for ever in any thing that be do under the sun go thy way eat thy bread with joy and drink thy wine with merry heart for god now accepteth thy work let thy garment be always white and let thy head lack no ointment live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the day of the life of thy vanity which he hath give thee under the sun all the day of thy vanity for that be thy portion in this life and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might for there be no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave whither thou goest return and saw under the sun that the race be not to the swift nor the battle to the strong neither yet bread to the wise nor yet rich to men of understand nor yet favour to men of skill but time and chance happeneth to them all for man also knoweth not his time a the fish that be take in an evil net and a the bird that be caught in the snare so be the son of men snare in an evil time when it falleth suddenly upon them this wisdom have see also under the sun and it seem great unto me there be little city and few men within it and there come great king against it and besiege it and built great bulwark against it now there be found in it poor wise man and he by his wisdom deliver the city yet no man remember that same poor man then say wisdom be well than strength nevertheless the poor man wisdom be despise and his word be not heard the word of wise men be heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fool wisdom be well than weapon of war but one sinner destroyeth much good dead fly cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth stink savour so doth little folly him that be in reputation for wisdom and honour wise man heart be at his right hand but fool heart at his left yea also when he that be fool walketh by the way his wisdom faileth him and he saith to every one that he be fool if the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee leave not thy place for yield pacifieth great offence there be an evil which have see under the sun a an error which proceedeth from the ruler folly be set in great dignity and the rich sit in low place have see servant upon horse and prince walk a servant upon the earth he that diggeth pit shall fall into it and whoso breaketh an hedge serpent shall bite him whoso removeth stone shall be hurt therewith and he that cleaveth wood shall be endanger thereby if the iron be blunt and he do not whet the edge then must he put to more strength but wisdom be profitable to direct surely the serpent will bite without enchantment and babbler be no well the word of wise man mouth be gracious but the lip of fool will swallow up himself the begin of the word of his mouth be foolishness and the end of his talk be mischievous madness fool also be full of word man cannot tell what shall be and what shall be after him who can tell him the labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them because he knoweth not how to go to the city woe to thee land when thy king be child and thy prince eat in the morning bless art thou land when thy king be the son of noble and thy prince eat in due season for strength and not for drunkenness by much slothfulness the building decayeth and through idleness of the hand the house droppeth through feast be make for laughter and wine maketh merry but money answereth all thing curse not the king no not in thy thought and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber for bird of the air shall carry the voice and that which hath wing shall tell the matter cast thy bread upon the water for thou shalt find it after many day give portion to seven and also to eight for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth if the cloud be full of rain they empty themselves upon the earth and if the tree fall toward the south or toward the north in the place where the tree falleth there it shall be he that observeth the wind shall not sow and he that regardeth the cloud shall not reap a thou knowest not what be the way of the spirit nor how the bone do grow in the womb of her that be with child even so thou knowest not the work of god who maketh all in the morning sow thy seed and in the even withhold not thine hand for thou knowest not whether shall prosper either this or that or whether they both shall be alike good truly the light be sweet and pleasant thing it be for the eye to behold the sun but if man live many year and rejoice in them all yet let him remember the day of darkness for they shall be many all that cometh be vanity rejoice young man in thy youth and let thy heart cheer thee in the day of thy youth and walk in the way of thine heart and in the sight of thine eye but know thou that for all these thing god will bring thee into judgment therefore remove sorrow from thy heart and put away evil from thy flesh for childhood and youth be vanity remember now thy creator in the day of thy youth while the evil day come not nor the year draw nigh when thou shalt say have no pleasure in them while the sun or the light or the moon or the star be not darken nor the cloud return after the rain in the day when the keeper of the house shall tremble and the strong men shall bow themselves and the grinder cease because they be few and those that look out of the window be darken and the door shall be shut in the street when the sound of the grind be low and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird and all the daughter of musick shall be brought low also when they shall be afraid of that which be high and fear shall be in the way and the almond tree shall flourish and the grasshopper shall be burden and desire shall fail because man goeth to his long home and the mourner go about the street or ever the silver cord be loose or the golden bowl be broken or the pitcher be broken at the fountain or the wheel broken at the cistern then shall the dust return to the earth a it be and the spirit shall return unto god who give it vanity of vanity saith the preacher all be vanity and moreover because the preacher be wise he still taught the people knowledge yea he give good heed and sought out and set in order many proverb the preacher sought to find out acceptable word and that which be write be upright even word of truth the word of the wise

behold cry woe unto them that join house to house that lay field to field till there be no place that they may be place alone in the midst of the earth in mine ear say the lord of host of truth many house shall be desolate even great and fair without inhabitant yea ten acre of vineyard shall yield one bath and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah woe unto them that rise up early in the morning that they may follow strong drink that continue until night till wine inflame them and the harp and the viol the tabret and pipe and wine be in their feast but they regard not the work of the lord neither consider the operation of his hand therefore my people be go into captivity because they have no knowledge and their honourable men be famish and their multitude dry up with thirst therefore hell hath enlarge herself and open her mouth without measure and their glory and their multitude and their pomp and he that rejoiceth shall descend into it and the mean man shall be brought down and the mighty man shall be humble and the eye of the lofty shall be humble but the lord of host shall be exalt in judgment and god that be holy shall be sanctify in righteousness then shall the lamb feed after their manner and the waste place of the fat one shall stranger eat woe unto them that draw iniquity with cord of vanity and sin a it be with cart rope that say let him make speed and hasten his work that we may see it and let the counsel of the holy one of israel draw nigh and come that we may know it woe unto them that call evil good and good evil that put darkness for light and light for darkness that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter woe unto them that be wise in their own eye and prudent in their own sight woe unto them that be mighty to drink wine and men of strength to mingle strong drink which justify the wicked for reward and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him therefore a the fire devoureth the stubble and the flame consumeth the chaff so their root shall be a rottenness and their blossom shall go up a dust because they have cast away the law of the lord of host and despise the word of the holy one of israel therefore be the anger of the lord kindle against his people and he hath stretch forth his hand against them and hath smitten them and the hill do tremble and their carcase be torn in the midst of the street for all this his anger be not turn away but his hand be stretch out still and he will lift up an ensign to the nation from far and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth and behold they shall come with speed swiftly none shall be weary nor stumble among them none shall slumber nor sleep neither shall the girdle of their loin be loose nor the latchet of their shoe be broken whose arrow be sharp and all their bow bent their horse hoof shall be count like flint and their wheel like whirlwind their roar shall be like lion they shall roar like young lion yea they shall roar and lay hold of the prey and shall carry it away safe and none shall deliver it and in that day they shall roar against them like the roar of the sea and if one look unto the land behold darkness and sorrow and the light be darken in the heaven thereof in the year that king uzziah die saw also the lord sit upon throne high and lift up and his train fill the temple above it stood the seraphims each one have six wing with

be rezin and within threescore and five year shall ephraim be broken that it be not people and the head of ephraim be samaria and the head of samaria be remaliah son if ye will not believe surely ye shall not be establish moreover the lord spake again unto ahaz say ask thee sign of the lord thy god ask it either in the depth or in the height above but ahaz say will not ask neither will tempt the lord and he say hear ye now house of david be it small thing for you to weary men but will ye weary my god also therefore the lord himself shall give you sign behold virgin shall conceive and bear son and shall call his name immanuel butter and honey shall he eat that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good for before the child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her king the lord shall bring upon thee and upon thy people and upon thy father house day that have not come from the day that ephraim depart from judah

and will look for him behold and the child whom the lord hath give me be for sign and for wonder in israel from the lord of host which dwelleth in mount zion and when they shall say unto you seek unto them that have familiar spirit and unto wizard that peep and that mutter should not people seek unto their god for the living to the dead to the law and to the testimony if they speak not accord to

spoil and to take the prey and to tread them down like the mire of the street howbeit he meaneth not so neither doth his heart think so but it be in his heart to destroy and cut off nation not few for he saith be not my prince altogether king be not calno a carchemish be not hamath a arpad be not samaria a damascus a my hand hath found the kingdom of the idol and whose graven image do excel them of jerusalem and of samaria shall not a have do unto samaria and her idol so do to jerusalem and her idol wherefore it shall come to pas that when the lord hath perform his whole work upon mount zion and

shall they arise awake and sing ye that dwell in dust for thy dew be a the dew of herb and the earth shall cast out the dead come my people enter thou into thy chamber and shut thy door about thee hide thyself a it be for little moment until the indignation be overpast for behold the lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitant of the earth for their iniquity the earth also shall disclose her blood and shall no more cover her slain in that day the lord with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the pierce serpent even leviathan that crooked serpent and he shall slay the dragon that be in the sea in that day sing ye unto her vineyard of red wine the lord do keep it will water it every moment l any hurt it will keep it night and day fury be not in me who

shall cause them that come of jacob to take root israel shall blossom and bud and fill the face of the world with fruit hath he smitten him a he smote those that smote him or be he slain accord to the slaughter of them that be slain by him in measure when it shooteth forth thou wilt debate with it he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind by this therefore shall the iniquity of jacob be purge and this be all the fruit to take away his sin when he maketh all the stone of the altar a chalkstone that be beaten in sunder the grove and image shall not stand up yet the defenced city shall be desolate and the habitation forsaken and left like wilderness there shall the calf feed and there shall he lie down and consume the branch thereof when the bough thereof be wither they shall be broken off the woman come and set them on fire for it be people of no understand therefore he that make them will not have mercy on them and he that form them will shew them no favour and it shall come to pas in that day that the lord shall beat off from the channel of the river unto the stream of egypt and ye shall be gather one by one ye child of israel and it shall come to pas in that day that the great trumpet shall be blown and they shall come which be ready to perish in the land of assyria and the outcast in the land of egypt and shall worship the lord in the holy mount at jerusalem woe to the crown of pride to the drunkard of ephraim whose glorious beauty be fading flower which be on the head of the fat valley of them that be overcome with wine behold the lord hath mighty and strong one which a tempest of hail and destroy storm a flood of mighty water overflow shall cast down to the earth with the hand the crown of pride the drunkard of ephraim shall be trodden under foot and the glorious beauty which be on the head of the fat valley shall be fading flower and a the hasty fruit before the summer which when he that looketh upon it seeth while it be yet in his hand he eateth it up in that day shall the lord of host be for crown of glory and for diadem of beauty unto the residue of his people and for spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate but they also have err through wine and through strong drink be out of the way the priest and the prophet have err through strong drink they be swallow up of wine they be out of the way through strong drink they err in vision they stumble in judgment for all table be full of vomit and filthiness so that there be no place clean whom shall he teach knowledge and whom shall he make to understand doctrine them that be wean from the milk and drawn from the breast for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here little and there little for with stammer lip and another tongue will he speak to this people to whom he say this be the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest and this be the refresh yet they would not hear but the word of the lord be unto them precept upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here little and there little that they might go and fall backward and be broken and snare and take wherefore hear the word of the lord ye scornful men that rule this people which be in jerusalem because ye have say we have make covenant with death and with hell be we at agreement when the overflow scourge shall pas through it shall not come unto u for we have make lie our refuge and under falsehood have we hid ourselves therefore thus saith the lord god behold lay in zion for foundation stone try stone precious corner stone sure foundation he that believeth shall not make haste judgment also will lay to the line and righteousness to the plummet and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lie and the water shall overflow the hiding place and your covenant with death shall be disannulled and your agreement with hell shall not stand when the overflow scourge shall pas through then ye shall be trodden down by it from the time that it goeth forth it shall take you for morning by morning shall it pas over by day and by night and it shall be vexation only to understand the report for the bed be shorter than that man can stretch himself on it and the cover narrower than that he can wrap himself in it for the lord shall rise up a in mount perazim he shall be wroth a in the valley of gibeon that he may do his work his strange work and bring to pas his act his strange act now therefore be ye not mocker l your band be make strong for have heard from the lord god of host consumption even determine upon the whole earth give ye ear and hear my voice hearken and hear my speech doth the plowman plow all day to sow doth he open and break the clod of his ground when he hath make plain the face thereof doth he not cast abroad the fitch and scatter the cummin and cast in the principal wheat and the appoint barley and the rie in their place for his god doth instruct him to discretion and doth teach him for the fitch be not thresh with thresh instrument neither be cart wheel turn about upon the cummin but the fitch be beaten out with staff and the cummin with rod bread corn be bruise because he will not ever be thresh it nor break it with the wheel of his cart nor bruise it with his horseman this also cometh forth from the lord of host which be wonderful in counsel and excellent in work woe to ariel to ariel the city where david dwelt add ye year to year let them kill sacrifice yet will distress ariel and there shall be heaviness and sorrow and it shall be unto me a ariel and will camp against thee round about and will lay siege against thee with mount and will raise fort against thee and thou shalt be brought down and shalt speak out of the ground and thy speech shall be low out of the dust and thy voice shall be a of one that hath familiar spirit out of the ground and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust moreover the multitude of thy stranger shall be like small dust and the multitude of the terrible one shall be a chaff that passeth away yea it shall be at an instant suddenly thou shalt be visit of the lord of host with thunder and with earthquake and great noise with storm and tempest and the flame of devour fire and the multitude of all the nation that fight against ariel even all that fight against her and her munition and that distress her shall be a dream of night vision it shall even be a when an hungry man dreameth and behold he eateth but he awaketh and his soul be empty or a when thirsty man dreameth and behold he drinketh but he awaketh and behold he be faint and his soul hath appetite so shall the multitude of all the nation be that fight against mount zion stay yourselves and wonder cry ye out and cry they be drunken but not with wine they stagger but not with strong drink for the lord hath pour out upon you the spirit of deep sleep and hath close your eye the prophet and your ruler the seer hath he cover and the vision of all be become unto you a the word of book that be seal which men deliver to one that be learn say read this pray thee and he saith cannot for it be seal and the book be deliver to him that be not learn say read this pray thee and he saith be not learn wherefore the lord say forasmuch a this people draw near me with their mouth and with their lip do honour me but have remove their heart far from me and their fear toward me be taught by the precept of men therefore behold will proceed to do marvellous work among this people even marvellous work and wonder for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish and the understand of their prudent men shall be hid woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the lord and their work be in the dark and they say who seeth u and who knoweth u surely your turn of thing upside down shall be esteem a the potter clay for shall the work say of him that make it he make me not or shall the thing frame say of him that frame it he have no understand be it not yet very little while and lebanon shall be turn into fruitful field and the fruitful field shall be esteem a forest and in that day shall the deaf hear the word of the book and the eye of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness the meek also shall increase their joy in the lord and the poor among men shall rejoice in the holy one of israel for the terrible one be brought to nought and the scorner be consume and all that watch for iniquity be cut off that make man an offender for word and lay snare for him that reproveth in the gate and turn aside the just for thing of nought therefore thus saith the lord who redeem abraham concern the house of jacob jacob shall not now be ashamed neither shall his face now wax pale but when he seeth his child the work of mine hand in the midst of him they shall sanctify my name and sanctify the holy one of jacob and shall fear the god of israel they also that err in spirit shall come to understand and they that murmur shall learn doctrine woe to the rebellious child saith the lord that take counsel but not of me and that cover with cover but not of my spirit that they may add sin to sin that walk to go down into egypt and have not ask at my mouth to strengthen themselves in the strength of pharaoh and to trust in the shadow of egypt therefore shall the strength of pharaoh be your shame and the trust in the shadow of egypt your confusion for his prince be at zoan and his ambassador come to hanes they be all ashamed of people that could not profit them nor be an help nor profit but shame and also reproach the burden of the beast of the south into the land of trouble and anguish from whence come the young and old lion the viper and fiery fly serpent they will carry their rich upon the shoulder of young ass and their treasure upon the bunch of camel to people that shall not profit them for the egyptian shall help in vain and to no purpose therefore have cry concern this their strength be to sit still now go write it before them in table and note it in book that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever that this be rebellious people lie child child that will not hear the law of the lord which say to the seer see not and to the prophet prophesy not unto u right thing speak unto u smooth thing prophesy deceit get you out of the way turn aside out of the path cause the holy one of israel to cease from before u wherefore thus saith the holy one of israel because ye despise this word and trust in oppression and perverseness and stay thereon therefore this iniquity shall be to you a breach ready to fall swell out in high wall whose break cometh suddenly at an instant and he shall break it a the break of the potter vessel that be broken in piece he shall not spare so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it sherd to take fire from the hearth or to take water withal out of the pit for thus saith the lord god the holy one of israel in return and rest shall ye be save in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength and ye would not but ye say no for we will flee upon horse therefore shall ye flee and we will ride upon the swift therefore shall they that pursue you be swift one thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one at the rebuke of five shall ye flee till ye be left a beacon upon the top of mountain and a an ensign on an hill and therefore will the lord wait that he may be gracious unto you and therefore will he be exalt that he may have mercy upon you for the lord be god of judgment bless be all they that wait for him for the people shall dwell in zion at jerusalem thou shalt weep no more he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry when he shall hear it he will answer thee and though the lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction yet shall not thy teacher be remove into corner any more but thine eye shall see thy teacher and thine ear shall hear word behind thee say this be the way walk ye in it when ye turn to the right hand and when ye turn to the left ye shall defile also the cover of thy graven image of silver and the ornament of thy molten image of gold thou shalt cast them away a menstruous cloth thou shalt say unto it get thee hence then shall he give the rain of thy seed that thou shalt sow the ground withal and bread of the increase of the earth and it shall be fat and plenteous in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pasture the ox likewise and the young ass that ear the ground shall eat clean provender which hath be winnowed with the shovel and with the fan and there shall be upon every high mountain and upon every high hill river and stream of water in the day of the great slaughter when the tower fall moreover the light of the moon shall be a the light of the sun and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold a the light of seven day in the day that the lord bindeth up the breach of his people and healeth the stroke of their wound behold the name of the lord cometh from far burning with his anger and the burden thereof be heavy his lip be full of indignation and his tongue a devour fire and his breath a an overflow stream shall reach to the midst of the neck to sift the nation with the sieve of vanity and there shall be bridle in the jaw of the people cause them to err ye shall have song a in the night when holy solemnity be kept and gladness of heart a when one goeth with pipe to come into the mountain of the lord to the mighty one of israel and the lord shall cause his glorious voice to be heard and shall shew the light down of his arm with the indignation of his anger and with the flame of devour fire with scatter and tempest and hailstone for through the voice of the lord shall the assyrian be beaten down which smote with rod and in every place where the ground staff shall pas which the lord shall lay upon him it shall be with tabrets and harp and in battle of shake will he fight with it for tophet be ordain of old yea for the king it be prepared he hath make it deep and large the pile thereof be fire and much wood the breath of the lord like stream of brimstone doth kindle it woe to them that go down to egypt for help and stay on horse and trust in chariot because they be many and in horseman because they be very strong but they look not unto the holy one of israel neither seek the lord yet he also be wise and will bring evil and will not call back his word but will arise against the house of the evildoer and against the help of them that work iniquity now the egyptian be men and not god and their horse flesh and not spirit when the lord shall stretch out his hand both he that helpeth shall fall and he that be holpen shall fall down and they all shall fail together for thus hath the lord spoken unto me like a the lion and the young lion roar on his prey when multitude of shepherd be call forth against him he will not be afraid of their voice nor abase himself for the noise of them so shall the lord of host come down to fight for mount zion and for the hill thereof a bird fly so will the lord of host defend jerusalem defend also he will deliver it and passing over he will preserve it turn ye unto him from whom the child of israel have deeply revolt for in that day every man shall cast away his idol of silver and his idol of gold which your own hand have make unto you for sin then shall the assyrian fall with the sword not of mighty man and the sword not of mean man shall devour him but he shall flee from the sword and his young men shall be discomfit and he shall pas over to his strong hold for fear and his prince shall be afraid of the ensign saith the lord whose fire be in zion and his furnace in jerusalem behold king shall reign in righteousness and prince shall rule in judgment and man shall be a an hiding place from the wind and covert from the tempest a river of water in dry place a the shadow of great rock in weary land and the eye of them that see shall not be dim and the ear of them that hear shall hearken the heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge and the tongue of the stammerer shall be ready to speak plainly the vile person shall be no more call liberal nor the churl say to be bountiful for the vile person will speak villany and his heart will work iniquity to practise hypocrisy and to utter error against the lord to make empty the soul of the hungry and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail the instrument also of the churl be evil he deviseth wicked device to destroy the poor with lie word even when the needy speaketh right but the liberal deviseth liberal thing and by liberal thing shall he stand rise up ye woman that be at ease hear my voice ye careless daughter give ear unto my speech many day and year shall ye be troubled ye careless woman for the vintage shall fail the gathering shall not come tremble ye woman that be at ease be troubled ye careless one strip you and make you bare and gird sackcloth upon your loin they shall lament for the teat for the pleasant field for the fruitful vine upon the land of my people shall come up thorn and brier yea upon all the house of joy in the joyous city because the palace shall be forsaken the multitude of the city shall be left the fort and tower shall be for den for ever joy of wild ass pasture of flock until the spirit be pour upon u from on high and the wilderness be fruitful field and the fruitful field be count for forest then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness and righteousness remain in the fruitful field and the work of righteousness shall be peace and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever and my people shall dwell in peaceable habitation and in sure dwelling and in quiet rest place when it shall hail come down on the forest and the city shall be low in low place bless be ye that sow beside all water that send forth thither

my way a nation that do righteousness and forsook not the ordinance of their god they ask of me the ordinance of justice they take delight in approach to god wherefore have we fast say they and thou seest not wherefore have we afflict our soul and thou takest no knowledge behold in the day of your fast ye find pleasure and exact all your labour behold ye fast for strife and debate and to smite with the fist of wickedness ye shall not fast a ye do this day to make your voice to be heard on high be it such fast that have chosen day for man to afflict his soul be it to bow down his head a bulrush and to spread sackcloth and ash under him wilt thou call this fast and an acceptable day to the lord be not this the fast that have chosen to loose the band of wickedness to undo the heavy burden and to let the oppress go free and that ye break every yoke be it not to deal thy bread to the hungry and that thou bring the poor that be cast out to thy house when thou seest the naked that thou cover him and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh then shall thy light break forth a the morning and thine health shall spring forth speedily and thy righteousness shall go before thee the glory of the lord shall be thy rereward then shalt thou call and the lord shall answer thou shalt cry and he shall say here be if thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke the put forth of the finger and speak vanity and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflict soul then shall thy light rise in obscurity and thy darkness be a the noon day and the lord shall guide thee continually and satisfy thy soul in drought and make fat thy bone and thou shalt be like water garden and like spring of water whose water fail not and they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste place thou shalt raise up the foundation of many generation and thou shalt be call the repairer of the breach the restorer of path to dwell in if thou turn away thy foot from the

from dan the whole land tremble at the sound of the neigh of his strong one for they be come and have devour the land and all that be in it the city and those that dwell therein for behold will send serpent cockatrice among you which will not be charm and they shall bite you saith the lord when would comfort myself against sorrow my heart be faint in me behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in far country be not the lord in zion be not her king in her why have they provoke me to anger with their graven image and with strange vanity the harvest be past the summer be end and we be not save for the hurt of the daughter of my people be hurt be black astonishment hath take hold on me be there no balm in gilead be there no physician there why then be not the health of the daughter of my people recover oh that my head be water and mine eye fountain of tear that might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people oh that have in the wilderness lodge place of wayfaring men that might leave my people and go from them for they be all adulterer an assembly of treacherous men and they bend their tongue like their bow for lie but they be not valiant for the truth upon the earth for they proceed from evil to evil and they know not me saith the lord take ye heed every one of his neighbour and trust ye not in any brother for every brother will utterly supplant and every neighbour will walk with slander and they will deceive every one his neighbour and will not speak the truth they have taught their tongue to speak lie and weary themselves to commit iniquity thine habitation be in the midst of deceit through deceit they refuse to know me saith the lord therefore thus saith the lord of host behold will melt them and try them for how shall do for the daughter of my people their tongue be a an arrow shot out it speaketh deceit one speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth but in heart he layeth his wait shall not visit them for these thing saith the lord shall not my soul be avenge on such nation a this for the mountain will take up weep and wail and for the habitation of the wilderness lamentation because they be burn up so that none can pas through them neither can men hear the voice of the cattle both the fowl of the heaven and the beast be flee they be go and will make jerusalem heap and den of dragon and will make the city of judah desolate without an inhabitant who be the wise man that may understand this and who be he to whom the mouth of the lord hath spoken that he may declare it for what the land perisheth and be burn up like wilderness that none passeth through and the lord saith because they have forsaken my law which set before them and have not obeyed my voice neither walk therein but have walk after the imagination of their own heart and after baalim which their father taught them therefore thus saith the lord of host the god of israel behold will feed them even this people with wormwood and give them water of gall to drink will scatter them also among the heathen whom neither they nor their father have know and will send sword after them till have consume them thus saith the lord of host consider ye and call for the mourn woman that they may come and send for cunning woman that they may come and let them make haste and take up wail for u that our eye may run down with tear and our eyelid gush out with water for voice of wail be heard out of zion how be we spoil we be greatly confound because we have forsaken the land because our dwelling have cast u

let him that glorieth glory in this that he understandeth and knoweth me that be the lord which exercise lovingkindness judgment and righteousness in the earth for in these thing delight saith the lord behold the day come saith the lord that will punish all them which be circumcise with the uncircumcised egypt and judah and edom and the child of ammon and moab and all that be in the utmost corner that dwell in the wilderness for all these nation be uncircumcised and all the house of israel be uncircumcised in the heart hear ye the word which the lord speaketh unto you house of israel thus saith the lord learn not the way of the heathen and be not dismayed at the sign of heaven for the heathen be dismayed at them for the custom of the people be vain for one cutteth tree out of the forest the work of the hand of the workman with the axe they deck it with silver and with gold they fasten it with nail and with hammer that it move not they be upright a the palm tree but speak not they must need be borne because they cannot go be not afraid of them for they cannot do evil neither also be it in them to do good forasmuch a there be none like unto thee lord thou art great and thy name be great in might who would not fear thee king of nation for to thee doth it appertain forasmuch a among all the wise men of the nation and in all their kingdom there be none like unto thee but they be altogether brutish and foolish the stock be doctrine of vanity silver spread into plate be brought from tarshish and gold from uphaz the work of the workman and of the hand of the founder blue and purple be their clothing they be all the work of cunning men but the lord be the true god he be the living god and an everlasting king at his wrath the earth shall tremble and the nation shall not be able to abide his indignation thus shall ye say unto them the god that have not make the heaven and the earth even they shall perish from the earth and from under these heaven he hath make the earth by his power he hath establish the world by his wisdom and hath stretch out the heaven by his discretion when he uttereth his voice there be multitude of water in the heaven and he causeth the vapour to ascend from the end of the earth he maketh lightning with rain and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasure every man be brutish in his knowledge every founder be confound by the graven image for his molten image be falsehood and there be no breath in them they be vanity and the work of error in the time of their visitation they shall perish the portion of jacob be not like them for he be the former of all thing and israel be the rod of his inheritance the lord of host be his name gather up thy ware out of the land inhabitant of the fortress for thus saith the lord behold will

desolate and den of dragon lord know that the way of man be not in himself it be not in man that walketh to direct his step lord correct me but with judgment not in thine anger l thou bring me to nothing pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not and upon the family that call not on thy name for they have eat up jacob and devour him and consume him and have make his habitation desolate the word that come to jeremiah from the lord say hear ye the word of this covenant and speak unto the men of judah and to the inhabitant of jerusalem and say thou unto them thus saith the lord god of israel curse be the man that obeyeth not the word of this covenant which command your father in the day that brought them forth out of the land of egypt from the iron furnace say obey my voice and do them accord to all which command you so shall ye be my people and will be your god that may perform the oath which have sworn unto your father to give them land flow with milk and honey a it be this day then answer and say so be it lord then the lord say unto me proclaim all these word in the city of judah and in the street of jerusalem say hear ye the word of this covenant and do them for earnestly protest unto your father in the day that brought them up out of the land of egypt even unto this day rise early and protest say obey my voice yet they obeyed not nor inclined their ear but walk every one in the imagination of their evil heart therefore will bring upon them all the word of this covenant which command them to do but they do them not and the lord say unto me conspiracy be found among the men of judah and among the inhabitant of jerusalem they be turn back to the iniquity of their forefather which refuse to hear my word and they go after other god to serve them the house of israel and the house of judah have broken my covenant which make with their father therefore thus saith the lord behold will bring evil upon them which they shall not be able to escape and though they shall cry unto me will not hearken unto them then shall the city of judah and inhabitant of jerusalem go and cry unto the god unto whom they offer incense but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble for accord to the number of thy city be thy god judah and accord to the number of the street of jerusalem have ye set up altar to that shameful thing even altar to burn incense unto baal therefore pray not thou for this people neither lift up cry or prayer for them for will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble what hath my beloved to do in mine house see she hath wrought lewdness with many and the holy flesh be pass from thee when thou doest evil then thou rejoicest the lord call thy name green olive tree fair and of goodly fruit

of the house of judah which they have do against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense unto baal and the lord hath give me knowledge of it and know it then thou shewedst me their doings but be like lamb or an ox that be brought to the slaughter and knew not that they have devise device against me say let u destroy the tree with the fruit thereof and let u cut him off from the land of the living that his name may be no more remember but lord of host that judgest righteously that triest the rein and the heart let me see thy vengeance on them for unto thee have reveal my cause therefore thus saith the lord of the men of anathoth that seek thy life say prophesy not in the name of the lord that thou die not by our hand therefore thus saith the lord of host behold will punish them the young men shall die by the sword their son and their daughter shall die by famine and there shall be no remnant of them for will bring evil upon the men of anathoth even the year of their visitation righteous art thou lord when plead with thee yet let me talk with thee of thy judgment wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper wherefore be all they happy that deal very treacherously thou hast plant them yea they have take root they grow yea they bring forth fruit thou art near in their mouth and far from their rein but thou lord knowest me thou hast see me and try mine heart toward thee pull them out like sheep for the slaughter and prepare them for the day of slaughter how long shall the land mourn and the herb of every field wither for the wickedness of them

them and will bring them again every man to his heritage and every man to his land and it shall come to pas if they will diligently learn the way of my people to swear by my name the lord liveth a they taught my people to swear by baal then shall they be built in the midst of my people but if they will not obey will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation saith the lord thus saith the lord unto me go and get thee linen girdle and put it upon thy loin and put it not in water so get girdle accord to the word of the lord and put it on my loin and the word of the lord come unto me the

wine and they shall say unto thee do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be fill with wine then shalt thou say unto them thus saith the lord behold will fill all the inhabitant of this land even the king that sit upon david throne and the priest and the prophet and all the inhabitant of jerusalem with drunkenness and will dash them one against another even the father and the son together

confound let them be dismayed but let not me be dismayed bring upon them the day of evil and destroy them with double destruction thus say the lord unto me go and stand in the gate of the child of the people whereby the king of judah come in and by the which they go out and in all the gate of jerusalem and say unto them hear ye the word of the lord ye king of judah and all judah and all the inhabitant of jerusalem that enter in by these gate thus saith the lord take heed to yourselves and bear no burden on the sabbath day nor bring it in by the gate of jerusalem neither carry forth burden out of your house on the sabbath day neither do ye any work but hallow ye the sabbath day a command your father but they obeyed not neither inclined their ear but make their neck stiff that they might not hear nor receive instruction and it shall come to pas if ye diligently hearken unto me saith the lord to bring in no burden through the gate of this city on the sabbath day but hallow the sabbath day to do no work therein then shall there enter into the gate of this city king and prince sit upon the throne of david rid in chariot and on horse they and their prince the men of judah and the inhabitant of jerusalem and this city shall remain for ever and they shall come from the city of judah and from the place about jerusalem and from the land of benjamin and from the plain and from the mountain and from the south bring burnt offering and sacrifice and meat offering and incense and bring sacrifice of praise unto the house of the lord but if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day and not to bear burden even enter in at the gate of jerusalem on the sabbath day then will kindle fire in the gate thereof and it shall devour the palace of jerusalem and it shall not be quenched the word which come to jeremiah from the lord say arise and go down to the potter house and there will cause thee to hear my word then go down to the potter house and behold he wrought work on the wheel and the vessel that he make of clay be mar in the hand of the potter so he make it again another vessel a seem good to the potter to make it then the word of the lord come to me say house of israel cannot do with you a this potter saith the lord behold a the clay be in the potter hand so be ye in mine hand house of israel at what instant shall speak concern nation and concern kingdom to pluck up and to pull down and to destroy it if that nation against whom have pronounce turn from their evil will repent of the evil that thought to do unto them and at what instant shall speak concern nation and concern kingdom to build and to plant it if it do evil in my sight that it obey not my voice then will repent of the good wherewith say would benefit them now therefore go to speak to the men of judah and to the inhabitant of jerusalem say thus saith the lord behold frame evil against you and devise device against you return ye now every one from his evil way and make your way and your doings good and they say there be no hope but we will walk after our own device and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart therefore thus saith the lord ask ye now among the heathen who hath heard such thing the virgin of israel hath do very horrible thing will man leave the snow of lebanon which cometh from the rock of the field or shall the cold flow water that come from another place be forsaken because my people hath forgotten me they have burn incense to vanity and they have cause them to stumble in their way from the ancient path to walk in path in way not cast up to make their land desolate and perpetual hiss every one that passeth thereby shall be astonish and wag his head will scatter them a with an east wind before the enemy will shew them the back and not the face in the day of their calamity then say they come and let u devise device against jeremiah for the law shall not perish from the priest nor counsel from the wise nor the word from the prophet come and let u smite him with the tongue and let u not give heed to any of his word give heed to me lord and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me shall evil be recompense for good for they have digged pit for my soul remember that stood before thee to speak good for them and to turn away thy wrath from them therefore deliver up their child to the famine and pour out their blood by the force of the sword and let their wife be bereave of their child and be widow and let their men be put to death let their young men be slain by the sword in battle let cry be heard from their house when thou shalt bring troop suddenly upon them for they have digged pit to take me and hid snare for my foot yet lord thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me forgive not their iniquity neither blot out their sin from thy sight but let them be overthrown before thee deal thus with them in the time of thine anger thus saith the lord go and get potter earthen bottle and take of the ancient of the people and of the ancient of the priest and go forth unto the valley of the son of hinnom which be by the entry of the east gate and proclaim there the word that shall tell thee and say hear ye the word of the lord king of judah and inhabitant of jerusalem thus saith the lord of host the god of israel behold will bring evil upon this place the which whosoever heareth his ear shall tingle because they have forsaken me and have estrange this place and have burn incense in it unto other god whom neither they nor their father have know nor the king of judah and have fill this place with the blood of innocent they have built also the high place of baal to burn their son with fire for burnt offering unto baal which command not nor spake it neither come it into my mind therefore behold the day come saith the lord that this place shall no more be call tophet nor the valley of the son of hinnom but the valley of slaughter and will make void the counsel of judah and jerusalem in this place and will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemy and by the hand of them that seek their life and their carcase will give to be meat for the fowl of the heaven and for the beast of the earth and will make this city desolate and an hiss every one that passeth thereby shall be astonish and hiss because of all the plague thereof and will cause them to eat the flesh of their son and the flesh of their daughter and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and straitness wherewith their enemy and they that seek their life shall straiten them then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee and shalt say unto them thus saith the lord of host even so will break this people and this city a one breaketh potter vessel that cannot be make whole again and they shall bury them in tophet till there be no place to bury thus will do unto this place saith the lord and to the inhabitant thereof and even make this city a tophet and the house of jerusalem and the house of the king of judah shall be defile a the place of tophet because of all the house upon whose roof they have burn incense unto all the host of heaven and have pour out drink offering unto other god then come jeremiah from tophet whither the lord have sent him to prophesy and he stood in the court of the lord house and say to all the people thus saith the lord of host the god of israel behold will bring upon this city and upon all her town all the evil that have pronounce against it because they have harden their neck that they might not hear my word now pashur the son of immer the priest who be also chief governor in the house of the lord heard that jeremiah prophesy these thing then pashur smote jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stock that be in the high gate of benjamin which be by the house of the lord and it come to pas on the morrow that pashur brought forth jeremiah out of the stock then say jeremiah unto him the lord hath not call thy name pashur but magormissabib for thus saith the lord behold will make thee terror to thyself and to all thy friend and they shall fall by the sword of their enemy and thine eye shall behold it and will give all judah into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall carry them captive into babylon and shall slay them with the sword moreover will deliver all the strength of this city and all the labour thereof and all the precious thing thereof and all the treasure of the king of judah will give into the hand of their enemy which shall spoil them and take them and carry them to babylon and thou pashur and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity and thou shalt come to babylon and there thou shalt die and shalt be bury there thou and all thy friend to whom thou hast prophesy lie lord thou hast deceive me and be deceive thou art strong than and hast prevail be in derision daily every one mocketh me for since spake cry out cry violence and spoil because the word of the lord be make reproach unto me and derision daily then say will not make mention of him nor speak any more in his name but his word be in mine heart a burning fire shut up in my bone and be weary with forbear and could not stay for heard the defame of many fear on every side report say they and we will report it all my familiar watch for my halt say peradventure he will be entice and we shall prevail against him and we shall take our revenge on him but the lord be with me a mighty terrible one therefore my persecutor shall stumble and they shall not prevail they shall be greatly ashamed for they shall not prosper their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten but lord of host that triest the righteous and seest the rein and the heart let me see thy vengeance on them for unto thee have open my cause sing unto the lord praise ye the lord for he hath deliver the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoer curse be the day wherein be born let not the day wherein my mother bare me be bless curse be the man who brought tidings to my father say man child be born unto thee make him very glad and let that man be a the city which the lord overthrew and repent not and let him hear the cry in the morning and the shout at noontide because he slew me not from the womb or that my mother might have be my grave and her womb to be always great with me wherefore come forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow that my day should be consume with shame the word which come unto jeremiah from the lord when king zedekiah sent unto him pashur the son of melchiah and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest say enquire pray thee of the lord for u for nebuchadrezzar king of babylon maketh war against u if so be that the lord will deal with u accord to all his wondrous work that he may go up from u then say jeremiah unto them thus shall ye say to zedekiah thus saith the lord god of israel behold will turn back the weapon of war that be in your hand wherewith ye fight against the king of babylon and against the chaldean which besiege you without the wall and will assemble them into the midst of this city and myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with strong arm even in anger and in fury and in great wrath and will smite the inhabitant of this city both man and beast they shall die of great pestilence and afterward saith the lord will deliver zedekiah king of judah and his servant and the people and such a be left in this city from the pestilence from the sword and from the famine into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hand of their enemy and into the hand of those that seek their life and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword he shall not spare them neither have pity nor have mercy and unto this people thou shalt say thus saith the lord behold set before you the way of life and the way of death he that abideth in this city shall die by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence but he that goeth out and falleth to the chaldean that besiege you he shall live and his life shall be unto him for prey for have set my face against this city for evil and not for good saith the lord it shall be give into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall burn it with fire and touch the house of the king of judah say hear ye the word of the lord house of david thus saith the lord execute judgment in the morning and deliver him that be spoil out of the hand of the oppressor l my fury go out like fire and burn that none can quench it because of the evil of your doings behold be against thee inhabitant of the valley and rock of the plain saith the lord which say who shall come down against u or who shall enter into our habitation but will punish you

this place for if ye do this thing indeed then shall there enter in by the gate of this house king sit upon the throne of david rid in chariot and on horse he and his servant and his people but if ye will not hear these word swear by myself saith the lord that this house shall become desolation for thus saith the lord unto the king house of judah thou art gilead unto me and the head of lebanon yet surely will make thee wilderness and city which be not inhabit and will prepare destroyer against thee every one with his weapon and they shall cut down thy choice cedar and cast them into the fire and many nation shall pas by this city and they shall say every man to his neighbour wherefore hath the lord do thus unto this great city then they shall answer because they have forsaken the covenant of the lord their god and worship other god and serve them weep ye not for the dead neither bemoan him but weep sore for him that goeth away for he shall return no more nor see his native country for thus saith the lord touch shallum the son of josiah king of judah which reign instead of josiah his father which go forth out of this place he shall not return thither any more but he shall die in the place whither they have lead him captive and shall see this land no more woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness and his chamber by wrong that useth his neighbour service without wage and giveth him not for his work that saith will build me wide house and large chamber and cutteth him out window and it be cieled with cedar and paint with vermilion shalt thou reign because thou closest thyself in cedar do not thy father eat and drink and do judgment and justice and then it be well with him he judged the cause of the poor and needy then it be well with him be not this to know

host hearken not unto the word of the prophet that prophesy unto you they make you vain they speak vision of their own heart and not out of the mouth of the lord they say still unto them that despise me the lord hath say ye shall have peace and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart no evil shall come upon you for who hath stood in the counsel of the lord and hath perceive and heard his word who hath marked his word and heard it behold whirlwind of the lord be go forth in fury even grievous whirlwind it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked the anger of the lord shall not return until he have execute and till he have perform the thought of his heart in the latter day ye shall consider it perfectly have not sent these prophet yet they ran have not spoken to them yet they prophesy but if they have stood in my counsel and have cause my people to hear my word then they should have turn them from their evil way and from the evil of their doings be god at hand saith the lord and not god afar off can any hide himself in secret place that shall not see him saith the lord do not fill heaven and earth saith the lord have heard what the prophet say that prophesy lie in my name say have dream have dream how long shall this be in the heart of the prophet that prophesy lie yea they be prophet of the deceit of their own heart which think

nation will punish saith the lord with the sword and with the famine and with the pestilence until have consume them by his hand therefore hearken not ye to your prophet nor to your diviner nor to your dreamer nor to your enchanter nor to your sorcerer which speak unto you say ye shall not serve the king of babylon for they prophesy lie unto you to remove you far from your land and that should

and burn it with the house upon whose roof they have offer incense unto baal and pour out drink offering unto other god to provoke me to anger for the child of israel and the child of judah have only do evil before me from their youth for the child of israel have only provoke me to anger with the work of their hand saith the lord for this city hath be to me a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day that should remove it from before my face because of all the evil of the child of israel and of the child of judah which they have do to provoke me to anger they their king their prince their priest and their prophet and the men of judah and the inhabitant of jerusalem and they have turn unto me the back and not the face though taught them

not for thus saith the lord the god of israel concern the house of this city and concern the house of the king of judah which be thrown down by the mount and by the sword they come to fight with the chaldean but it be to fill them with the dead body of men whom have slain in mine anger and in my fury and for all whose wickedness have hid my face from this city behold will bring it health and cure and will cure them and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth and will cause the captivity of judah and the captivity of israel to return and will build them a at the first and will cleanse them from all their iniquity whereby they have sin against me and will pardon all their iniquity whereby they have sin and whereby they have transgress against me and it shall be to me name of joy praise and an honour before all the nation of the earth which shall hear all the good that do unto them and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that procure unto it thus saith the lord again there shall be heard in this place which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast even in the city of judah and in the street of jerusalem that be desolate without man and without inhabitant and without beast the voice of joy and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the voice of them that shall say praise the lord of host for the lord be good for his mercy endureth for ever and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the lord for will cause to return the captivity of the land a at the first saith the lord thus saith the lord of host again in this place which be desolate without man and without beast and in all the city thereof shall be an habitation of shepherd cause their flock to lie down in the city of the mountain in the city of the vale and in the city of the south and in the land of benjamin and in the place about jerusalem and in the city of judah shall the flock pas again under the hand of him that telleth them saith the lord behold the day come saith the lord that will perform that good thing which have promise unto the house of israel and to the house of judah in those day and at that time will cause the branch of righteousness to grow up unto david and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land in those day shall judah be save and jerusalem shall dwell safely and this be the name wherewith she shall be call the lord our righteousness for thus saith the lord david shall never want man to sit upon the throne of the house of israel neither shall the priest the levite want man before me to offer burnt offering and to kindle meat offering and to do sacrifice continually and the word of the lord come unto jeremiah say thus saith the lord if ye can break my covenant of the day and my covenant of the night and that there should not be day and night in their season then may also my covenant be broken with david my servant that he should not have son to reign upon his throne and with the levite the priest my minister a the host of heaven cannot be numbered neither the sand of the sea measure so will multiply the seed of david my servant and the levite that minister unto me moreover the word of the lord come to jeremiah say considerest thou not what this people have spoken say the two family which the lord hath chosen he hath even cast them off thus they have despise my people that they should be no more nation before them thus saith the lord if my covenant be not with day and night and if have not appoint the ordinance of heaven and earth then will cast away the seed of jacob and david my servant so that will not take any of his seed to be ruler over the seed of abraham isaac and jacob for will cause their captivity to return and have mercy on them the word which come unto jeremiah from the lord when nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and all his army and all the kingdom of the earth of his dominion and all the people fought against jerusalem and against all the city thereof say thus saith the lord the god of israel go and speak to zedekiah king of judah and tell him thus saith the lord behold will give this city into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall burn it with fire and thou shalt not escape out of his hand but shalt surely be take and deliver into his hand and thine eye shall behold the eye of the king of babylon and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth and thou shalt go to babylon yet hear the word of the lord zedekiah king of judah thus saith the lord of thee thou shalt not die by the sword but thou shalt die in peace and with the burning of thy father the former king which be before thee so shall they burn odour for thee and they will lament thee say ah lord for have pronounce the word saith the lord then jeremiah the prophet spake all these word unto zedekiah king of judah in jerusalem when the king of babylon army fought against jerusalem and against all the city of judah that be left against lachish and against azekah for these defenced city remain of the city of judah this be the word that come unto jeremiah from the lord after that the king zedekiah have make covenant with all the people which be at jerusalem to proclaim liberty unto them that every man should let his manservant and every man his maidservant be an hebrew or an hebrewess go free that none should serve himself of them to wit of jew his brother now when all the prince and all the people which have enter into the covenant heard that every one should let his manservant and every one his maidservant go free that none should serve themselves of them any more then they obeyed and let them go but afterward they turn and cause the servant and the handmaid whom they have let go free to return and brought them into subjection for servant and for handmaid therefore the word of the lord come to jeremiah from the lord say thus saith the lord the god of israel make covenant with your father in the day that brought them forth out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondman say at the end of seven year let ye go every man his brother an hebrew which hath be sell unto thee and when he hath serve thee six year thou shalt let him go free from thee but your father hearken not unto me neither inclined their ear and ye be now turn and have do right in my sight in proclaim liberty every man to his neighbour and ye have make covenant before me in the house which be call by my name but ye turn and pollute my name and cause every man his servant and every man his handmaid whom he have set at liberty at their pleasure to return and brought them into subjection to be unto you for servant and for handmaid therefore thus saith the lord ye have not hearken unto me in proclaim liberty every one to his brother and every man to his neighbour behold proclaim liberty for you saith the lord to the sword to the pestilence and to the famine and will make you to be remove into all the kingdom of the earth and will give the men that have transgress my covenant which have not perform the word of the covenant which they have make before me when they cut the calf in twain and pass between the part thereof the prince of judah and the prince of jerusalem the eunuch and the priest and all the people of the land which pass between the part of the calf will even give them into the hand of their enemy and into the hand of them that seek their life and their dead body shall be for meat unto the fowl of the heaven and to the beast of the earth and zedekiah king of judah and his prince will give into the hand of their enemy and into the hand of them that seek their life and into the hand of the king of babylon army which be go up from you behold will command saith the lord and cause them to return to this city and they shall fight against it and take it and burn it with fire and will make the city of judah desolation without an inhabitant the word which come unto jeremiah from the lord in the day of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah say go unto the house of the rechabites and speak unto them and bring them into the house of the lord into one of the chamber and give them wine to drink then take jaazaniah the son of jeremiah the son of habaziniah and his brother and all his son and the whole house of the rechabites and brought them into the house of the lord into the chamber of the son of hanan the son of igdaliah man of god which be by the chamber of the prince which be above the chamber of maaseiah the son of shallum the keeper of the door and set before the son of the house of the rechabites pot full of wine and cup and say unto them drink ye wine but they say we will drink no wine for jonadab the son of rechab our father command u say ye shall drink no wine neither ye nor your son for ever neither shall ye build house nor sow seed nor plant vineyard nor have any but all your day ye shall dwell in tent that ye may live many day in the land where ye be stranger thus have we obeyed the voice of jonadab the son of rechab our father in all that he hath charge u to drink no wine all our day we our wife our son nor our daughter nor to build house for u to dwell in neither have we vineyard nor field nor seed but we have dwelt in tent and have obeyed and do accord to all that jonadab our father command u but it come to pas when nebuchadrezzar king of babylon come up into the land that we say come and let u go to jerusalem for fear of the army of the chaldean and for fear of the army of the syrian so we dwell at jerusalem then come the word of the lord unto jeremiah say thus saith the lord of host the god of israel go and tell the men of judah and the inhabitant of jerusalem will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my word saith the lord the word of jonadab the son of rechab that he command his son not to drink wine be perform for unto this day they drink none but obey their father commandment notwithstanding have spoken unto you rise early and speak but ye hearken not unto me have sent also unto you all my servant the prophet rise up early and send them say return ye now every man from his evil way and amend your doings and go not after other god to serve them and ye shall dwell in the land which have give to you and to your father but ye have not inclined your ear nor hearken unto me because the son of jonadab the son of rechab have perform the commandment of their father which he command them but this people hath not hearken unto me therefore thus saith the lord god of host the god of israel behold will bring upon judah and upon all the inhabitant of jerusalem all the evil that have pronounce against them because have spoken unto them but they have not heard and have call unto them but they have not answer and jeremiah say unto the house of the rechabites thus saith the lord of host the god of israel because ye have obeyed the commandment of jonadab your father and kept all his precept and do accord unto all that he hath command you therefore thus saith the lord of host the god of israel jonadab the son of rechab shall not want man to stand before me for ever and it come to pas in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah that this word come unto jeremiah from the lord say take thee roll of book and write therein all the word that have spoken unto thee against israel and against judah and against all the nation from the day spake unto thee from the day of josiah even unto this day it may be that the house of judah will hear all the evil which purpose to do unto them that they may return every man from his evil way that may forgive their iniquity and their sin then jeremiah call baruch the son of neriah and baruch write from the mouth of jeremiah all the word of the lord which he have spoken unto him upon roll of book and jeremiah command baruch say be shut up cannot go into the house of the lord therefore go thou and read in the roll which thou hast write from my mouth the word of the lord in the ear of the people in the lord house upon the fast day and also thou shalt read them in the ear of all judah that come out of their city it may be they will present their supplication before the lord and will return every one from his evil way for great be the anger and the fury that the lord hath pronounce against this people and baruch the son of neriah do accord to all that jeremiah the prophet command him reading in the book the word of the lord in the lord house and it come to pas in the fifth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah in the ninth month that they proclaim fast before the lord to all the people in jerusalem and to all the people that come from the city of judah unto jerusalem then read baruch in the book the word of jeremiah in the house of the lord in the chamber of gemariah the son of shaphan the scribe in the high court at the entry of the new gate of the lord house in the ear of all the people when michaiah the son of gemariah the son of shaphan have heard out of the book all the word of the lord then he go down into the king house into the scribe chamber and lo all the prince sat there even elishama the scribe and delaiah the son of shemaiah and elnathan the son of achbor and gemariah the son of shaphan and zedekiah the son of hananiah and all the prince then michaiah declare unto them all the word that he have heard when baruch read the book in the ear of the people therefore all the prince sent jehudi the son of nethaniah the son of shelemiah the son of cushi unto baruch say take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ear of the people and come so baruch the son of neriah take the roll in his hand and come unto them and they say unto him sit down now and read it in our ear so baruch read it in their ear now it come to pas when they have heard all the word they be afraid both one and other and say unto baruch we will surely tell the king of all these word and they ask baruch say tell u now how didst thou write all these word at his mouth then baruch answer them he pronounce all these word unto me with his mouth and write them with ink in the book then say the prince unto baruch go hide thee thou and jeremiah and let no man know where ye be and they go in to the king into the court but they laid up the roll in the chamber of elishama the scribe and told all the word in the ear of the king so the king sent jehudi to fetch the roll and he take it out of elishama the scribe chamber and jehudi read it in the ear of the king and in the ear of all the prince which stood beside the king now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month and there be fire on the hearth burning before him and it come to pas that when jehudi have read three or four leaf he cut it with the penknife and cast it into the fire that be on the hearth until all the roll be consume in the fire that be on the hearth yet they be not afraid nor rent their garment neither the king nor any of his servant that heard all these word nevertheless elnathan and delaiah and gemariah have make intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll but he would not hear them but the king command jerahmeel the son of hammelech and seraiah the son of azriel and shelemiah the son of abdeel to take baruch the scribe and jeremiah the prophet but the lord hid them then the word of the lord come to jeremiah after that the king have burn the roll and the word which baruch write at the mouth of jeremiah say take thee again another roll and write in it all the former word that be in the first roll which jehoiakim the king of judah hath burn and thou shalt say to jehoiakim king of judah thus saith the lord thou hast burn this roll say why hast thou write therein say the king of babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast therefore thus saith the lord of jehoiakim king of judah he shall have none to sit upon the throne of david and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat and in the night to the frost and will punish him and his seed and his servant for their iniquity and will bring upon them and upon the inhabitant of jerusalem and upon the men of judah all the evil that have pronounce against them but they hearken not then take jeremiah another roll and give it to baruch the scribe the son of neriah who write therein from the mouth of jeremiah all the word of the book which jehoiakim king of judah have burn in the fire and there be add besides unto them many like word and king zedekiah the son of josiah reign instead of coniah the son of jehoiakim whom nebuchadrezzar king of babylon make king in the land of judah but neither he nor his servant nor the people of the land do hearken unto the word of the lord which he spake by the prophet jeremiah and zedekiah the king sent jehucal the son of shelemiah and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest to the prophet jeremiah say pray now unto the lord our god for u now jeremiah come in and go out among the people for they have not put him into prison then pharaoh army be come forth out of egypt and when the chaldean that besiege jerusalem heard tidings of them they depart from jerusalem then come the word of the lord unto the prophet jeremiah say thus saith the lord the god of israel thus shall ye say to the king of judah that sent you unto me to enquire of me behold pharaoh army which be come forth to help you shall return to egypt into their own land and the chaldean shall come again and fight against this city and take it and burn it with fire thus saith the lord deceive not yourselves say the chaldean shall surely depart from u for they shall not depart for though ye have smitten the whole army of the chaldean that fight against you and there remain but wound men among them yet should they rise up every man in his tent and burn this city with fire and it come to pas that when the army of the chaldean be broken up from jerusalem for fear of pharaoh army then jeremiah go forth out of jerusalem to go into the land of benjamin to separate himself thence in the midst of the people and when he be in the gate of benjamin captain of the ward be there whose name be irijah the son of shelemiah the son of hananiah and he take jeremiah the prophet say thou fallest away to the chaldean then say jeremiah it be false fall not away to the chaldean but he hearken not to him so irijah take jeremiah and brought him to the prince wherefore the prince be wroth with jeremiah and smote him and put him in prison in the house of jonathan the scribe for they have make that the prison when jeremiah be enter into the dungeon and into the cabin and jeremiah have remain there many day then zedekiah the king sent and take him out and the king ask him secretly in his house and say be there any word from the lord and jeremiah say there be for say he thou shalt be deliver into the hand of the king of babylon moreover jeremiah say unto king zedekiah what have offend against thee or against thy servant or against this people that ye have put me in prison where be now your prophet which prophesy unto you say the king of babylon shall not come against you nor against this land therefore hear now pray thee my lord the king let my supplication pray thee be accepted before thee that thou cause me not to return to the house of jonathan the scribe l die there then zedekiah the king command that they should commit jeremiah into the court of the prison and that they should give him daily piece of bread out of the baker street until all the bread in the city be spent thus jeremiah remain in the court of the prison then shephatiah the son of mattan and gedaliah the son of pashur and jucal the son of shelemiah and pashur the son of malchiah heard the word that jeremiah have spoken unto all the people say thus saith the lord he that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence but he that goeth forth to the chaldean shall live for he shall have his life for prey and shall live thus saith the lord this city shall surely be give into the hand of the king of babylon army which shall take it therefore the prince say unto the king we beseech thee let this man be put to death for thus he weakeneth the hand of the men of war that remain in this city and the hand of all the people in speak such word unto them for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people but the hurt then zedekiah the king say behold he be in your hand for the king be not he that can do any thing against you then take they jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon of malchiah the son of hammelech that be in the court of the prison and they let down jeremiah with cord and in the dungeon there be no water but mire so jeremiah sunk in the mire now when ebedmelech the ethiopian one of the eunuch which be in the king house heard that they have put jeremiah in the dungeon the king then sit in the gate of benjamin ebedmelech go forth out of the king house and spake to the king say my lord the king these men have do evil in all that they have do to jeremiah the prophet whom they have cast into the dungeon and he be like to die for hunger in the place where he be for there be no more bread in the city then the king command ebedmelech the ethiopian say take from hence thirty men with thee and take up jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon before he die so ebedmelech take the men with him and go into the house of the king under the treasury and take thence old cast clout and old rotten rag and let them down by cord into the dungeon to jeremiah and ebedmelech the ethiopian say unto jeremiah put now these old cast clout and rotten rag under thine armhole under the cord and jeremiah do so so they drew up jeremiah with cord and take him up out of the dungeon and jeremiah remain in the court of the prison then zedekiah the king sent and take jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that be in the house of the lord and the king say unto jeremiah will ask thee thing hide nothing from me then jeremiah say unto zedekiah if declare it unto thee wilt thou not surely put me to death and if give thee counsel wilt thou not hearken unto me so zedekiah the king sware secretly unto jeremiah say a the lord liveth that make u this soul will not put thee to death neither will give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life then say jeremiah unto zedekiah thus saith the lord the god of host the god of israel if thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of babylon prince then thy soul shall live and this city shall not be burn with fire and thou shalt live and thine house but if thou wilt not go forth to the king of babylon prince then shall this city be give into the hand of the chaldean and they shall burn it with fire and thou shalt not escape out of their hand and zedekiah the king say unto jeremiah be afraid of the jew that be fall to the chaldean l they deliver me into their hand and they mock me but jeremiah say they shall not deliver thee obey beseech thee the voice of the lord which speak unto thee so it shall be well unto thee and thy soul shall live but if thou refuse to go forth this be the word that the lord hath shew me and behold all the woman that be left in the king of judah house shall be brought forth to the king of babylon prince and those woman shall say thy friend have set thee on and have prevail against thee thy foot be sunk in the mire and they be turn away back so they shall bring out all thy wife and thy child to the chaldean and thou shalt not escape out of their hand but shalt be take by the hand of the king of babylon and thou shalt cause this city to be burn with fire then say zedekiah unto jeremiah let no man know of these word and thou shalt not die but if the prince hear that have talk with thee and they come unto thee and say unto thee declare unto u now what thou hast say unto the king hide it not from u and we will not put thee to death also what the king say unto thee then thou shalt say unto them present my supplication before the king that he would not cause me to return to jonathan house to die there then come all the prince unto jeremiah and ask him and he told them accord to all these word that the king have command so they left off speak with him for the matter be not perceive so jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that jerusalem be take and he be there when jerusalem be take in the ninth year of zedekiah king of judah in the tenth month come nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and all his army against jerusalem and they besiege it and in the eleventh year of zedekiah in the fourth month the

way of the king garden by the gate betwixt the two wall and he go out the way of the plain but the chaldean army pursue after them and overtook zedekiah in the plain of jericho and when they have take him they brought him up to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon to riblah in the land of hamath where he give judgment upon him then the king of babylon slew the son of zedekiah in riblah before his eye also the king of babylon slew all the noble of judah moreover he put out zedekiah eye and bound him with chain to carry him to babylon and the chaldean burn the king house and the house of the people with fire and brake down the wall of jerusalem then nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away captive into babylon the remnant of the people that remain in the city and those that fell away that fell to him with the rest of the people that remain but nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people which have nothing in the land of judah and give them vineyard and field at the same time now nebuchadrezzar king of babylon give charge concern jeremiah to nebuzaradan the captain of the guard say take him and look well to him and do him no harm but do unto him even a he shall say unto thee so nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent and nebushasban rabsaris and nergalsharezer rabmag and all the king of babylon prince even they sent and take jeremiah out of the court of the prison and commit him unto gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan that he should carry him home so he dwelt among the people now the word of the lord come unto jeremiah while he be shut up in the court of the prison say go and speak to ebedmelech the ethiopian say thus saith the lord of host the god of israel behold will bring my word upon this city for evil and not for good and they shall be accomplish in that day before thee but will deliver thee in that day saith the lord and thou shalt not be give into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid for will surely deliver thee and thou shalt not fall by the sword but thy life shall be for prey unto thee because thou hast put thy trust in me saith the lord the word that come to jeremiah from the lord after that nebuzaradan the captain of the guard have let him go from ramah when he have take him be bound in chain among all that be carry away captive of jerusalem and judah which be carry away captive unto babylon and the captain of the guard take jeremiah and say unto him the lord thy god hath pronounce this evil upon this place now the lord hath brought it and do accord a he hath say because ye have sin against the lord and have not obeyed his voice therefore this thing be come upon you and now behold loose thee this day from the chain which be upon thine hand if it seem good unto thee to come with me into babylon come and will look well unto thee but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into babylon forbear behold all the land be before thee whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go thither go now while he be not yet go back he say go back also to gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan whom the king of babylon hath make governor over the city of judah and dwell with him among the people or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go so the captain of the guard give him victual and reward and let him go then go jeremiah unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah and dwelt with him among the people that be left in the land now when all the captain of the force which be in the field even they and their men heard that the king of babylon have make gedaliah the son of ahikam governor in the land and have commit unto him men and woman and child and of the poor of the land of them that be not carry away captive to babylon then they come to gedaliah to mizpah even ishmael the son of nethaniah and johanan and jonathan the son of kareah and seraiah the son of tanhumeth and the son of ephai the netophathite and jezaniah the son of maachathite they and their men and gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan sware unto them and to their men say fear not to serve the chaldean dwell in the land and serve the king of babylon and it shall be well with you a for me behold will dwell at mizpah to serve the chaldean which will come unto u but ye gather ye wine and summer fruit and oil and put them in your vessel and dwell in your city that ye have take likewise when all the jew that be in moab and among the ammonite and in edom and that be in all the country heard that the king of babylon have left remnant of judah and that he have set over them gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan even all the jew return out of all place whither they be driven and come to the land of judah to gedaliah unto mizpah and gather wine and summer fruit very much moreover johanan the son of kareah and all the captain of the force that be in the field come to gedaliah to mizpah and say unto him dost thou certainly know that baalis the king of the ammonite hath sent ishmael the son of nethaniah to slay thee but gedaliah the son of ahikam believe them not then johanan the son of kareah spake to gedaliah in mizpah secretly say let me go pray thee and will slay ishmael the son of nethaniah and no man shall know it wherefore should he slay thee that all the jew which be gather unto thee should be scatter and the remnant in judah perish but gedaliah the son of ahikam say unto johanan the son of kareah thou shalt not do this thing for thou speakest falsely of ishmael now it come to pas in the seventh month that ishmael the son of nethaniah the son of elishama of the seed royal and the prince of the king even ten men with him come unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah and there they do eat bread together in mizpah then arose ishmael the son of nethaniah and the ten men that be with him and smote gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan with the sword and slew him whom the king of babylon have make governor over the land ishmael also slew all the jew that be with him even with gedaliah at mizpah and the chaldean that be found there and the men of war and it come to pas the second day after he have slain gedaliah and no man knew it that there come certain from shechem from shiloh and from samaria even fourscore men have their beard shaven and their clothes rent and have cut themselves with offering and incense in their hand to bring them to the house of the lord and ishmael the son of nethaniah go forth from mizpah to meet them weep all along a he go and it come to pas a he met them he say unto them come to gedaliah the son of ahikam and it be so when they come into the midst of the city that ishmael the son of nethaniah slew them and cast them into the midst of the pit he and the men that be with him but ten men be found among them that say unto ishmael slay u not for we have treasure in the field of wheat and of barley and of oil and of honey so he forbare and slew them not among their brother now the pit wherein ishmael have cast all the dead body of the men whom he have slain because of gedaliah be it which asa the king have make for fear of baasha king of israel and ishmael the son of nethaniah fill it with them that be slain then ishmael carry away captive all the residue of the people that be in mizpah even the king daughter and all the people that remain in mizpah whom nebuzaradan the captain of the guard have commit to gedaliah the son of ahikam and ishmael the son of nethaniah carry them away captive and depart to go over to the ammonite but when johanan the son of kareah and all the captain of the force that be with him heard of all the evil that ishmael the son of nethaniah have do then they take all the men and go to fight with ishmael the son of nethaniah and found him by the great water that be in gibeon now it come to pas that when all the people which be with ishmael saw johanan the son of kareah and all the captain of the force that be with him then they be glad so all the people that ishmael have carry away captive from mizpah cast about and return and go unto johanan the son of kareah but ishmael the son of nethaniah escape from johanan with eight men and go to the ammonite then take johanan the son of kareah and all the captain of the force that be with him all the remnant of the people whom he have recover from ishmael the son of nethaniah from mizpah after that he have slain gedaliah the son of ahikam even mighty men of war and the woman and the child and the eunuch whom he have brought again from gibeon and they depart and dwelt in the habitation of chimham which be by bethlehem to go to enter into egypt because of the chaldean for they be afraid of them because ishmael the son of nethaniah have slain gedaliah the son of ahikam whom the king of babylon make governor in the land then all the captain of the force and johanan the son of kareah and jezaniah the son of hoshaiah and all the people from the least even unto the great come near and say unto jeremiah the prophet let we beseech thee our supplication be accepted before thee and pray for u unto the lord thy god even for all this remnant for we be left but few of many a thine eye do behold u that the lord thy god may shew u the way wherein we may walk and the thing that we may do then jeremiah the prophet say unto them have heard you behold will pray unto the lord your god accord to your word and it shall come to pas that whatsoever thing the lord shall answer you will declare it unto you will keep nothing back from you then they say to jeremiah the lord be true and faithful witness between u if we do not even accord to all thing for the which the lord thy god shall send thee to u whether it be good or whether it be evil we will obey the voice of the lord our god to whom we send thee that it may be well with u when we obey the voice of the lord our god and it come to pas after ten day that the word of the lord come unto jeremiah then call he johanan the son of kareah and all the captain of the force which be with him and all the people from the least even to the great and say unto them thus saith the lord the god of israel unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him if ye will still abide in this land then will build you and not pull you down and will plant you and not pluck you up for repent me of the evil that have do unto you be not afraid of the king of babylon of whom ye be afraid be not afraid of him saith the lord for be with you to save you and to deliver you from his hand and will shew mercy unto you that he may have mercy upon you and cause you to return to your own land but if ye say we will not dwell in this land neither obey the voice of the lord your god say no but we will go into the land of egypt where we shall see no war nor hear the sound of the trumpet nor have hunger of bread and there will we dwell and now therefore hear the word of the lord ye remnant of judah thus saith the lord of host the god of israel if ye wholly set your face to enter into egypt and go to sojourn there then it shall come to pas that the sword which ye fear shall overtake you there in the land of egypt and the famine whereof ye be afraid shall follow close after you there in egypt and there ye shall die so shall it be with all the men that set their face to go into egypt to sojourn there they shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that will bring upon them for thus saith the lord of host the god of israel a mine anger and my fury hath be pour forth upon the inhabitant of jerusalem so shall my fury be pour forth upon you when ye shall enter into egypt and ye shall be an execration and an astonishment and curse and reproach and ye shall see this place no more the lord hath say concern you ye remnant of judah go ye not into egypt know certainly that have admonish you this day for ye dissemble in your heart when ye sent me unto the lord your god say pray for u unto the lord our god and accord unto all that the lord our god shall say so declare unto u and we will do it and now have this day declare it to you but ye have not obeyed the voice of the lord your god nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn and it come to pas that when jeremiah have make an end of speak unto all the people all the word of the lord their god for which the lord their god have sent him to them even all these word then spake azariah the son of hoshaiah and johanan the son of kareah and all the proud men say unto jeremiah thou speakest falsely the lord our god hath not sent thee to say go not into egypt to sojourn there but baruch the son of neriah setteth thee on against u for to deliver u into the hand of the chaldean that they might put u to death and carry u away captive into babylon so johanan the son of kareah and all the captain of the force and all the people obeyed not the voice of the lord to dwell in the land of judah but johanan the son of kareah and all the captain of the force take all the remnant of judah that be return from all nation whither they have be driven to dwell in the land of judah even men and woman and child and the king daughter and every person that nebuzaradan the captain of the guard have left with gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan and jeremiah the prophet and baruch the son of neriah so they come into the land of egypt for they obeyed not the voice of the lord thus come they even to tahpanhes then come the word of the lord unto jeremiah in tahpanhes say take great stone in thine hand and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln which be at the entry of pharaoh house in tahpanhes in the sight of the men of judah and say unto them thus saith the lord of host the god of israel behold will send and take nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon my servant and will set his throne upon these stone that have hid and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them and when he cometh he shall smite the land of egypt and deliver such a be for death to death and such a be for captivity to captivity and such a be for the sword to the sword and will kindle fire in the house of the god of egypt and he shall burn them and carry them away captive and he shall array himself with the land of egypt a shepherd putteth on his garment and he shall go forth from thence in peace he shall break also the image of bethshemesh that be in the land of egypt and the house of the god of the egyptian shall he burn with fire the word that come to jeremiah concern all the jew which dwell in the land of egypt which dwell at migdol and at tahpanhes and at noph and in the country of pathros say thus saith the lord of host the god of israel ye have see all the evil that have brought upon jerusalem and upon all the city of judah and behold this day they be desolation and no man dwelleth therein because of their wickedness which they have commit to provoke me to anger in that they go to burn incense and to serve other god whom they knew not neither they ye nor your father howbeit sent unto you all my servant the prophet rise early and send them say oh do not this abominable thing that hate but they hearken not nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness to burn no incense unto other god wherefore my fury and mine anger be pour forth and be kindle in the city of judah and in the street of jerusalem and they be waste and desolate a at this day therefore now thus saith the lord the god of host the god of israel wherefore commit ye this great evil against your soul to cut off from you man and woman child and suckle out of judah to leave you none to remain in that ye provoke me unto wrath with the work of your hand burning incense unto other god in the land of egypt whither ye be go to dwell that ye might cut yourselves off and that ye might be curse and reproach among all the nation of the earth have ye forgotten the wickedness of your father and the wickedness of the king of judah and the wickedness of their wife and your own wickedness and the wickedness of your wife which they have commit in the land of judah and in the street of jerusalem they be not humble even unto this day neither have they fear nor walk in my law nor in my statute that set before you and before your father therefore thus saith the lord of host the god of israel behold will set my face against you for evil and to cut off all judah and will take the remnant of judah that have set their face to go into the land of egypt to sojourn there and they shall all be consume and fall in the land of egypt they shall even be consume by the sword and by the famine they shall die from the least even unto the great by the sword and by the famine and they shall be an execration and an astonishment and curse and reproach for will punish them that dwell in the land of egypt a have punish jerusalem by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence so that none of the remnant of judah which be go into the land of egypt to sojourn there shall escape or remain that they should return into the land of judah to the which they have desire to return to dwell there for none shall return but such a shall escape then all the men which knew that their wife have burn incense unto other god and all the woman that stood by great multitude even all the people that dwelt in the land of egypt in pathros answer jeremiah say a for the word that thou hast spoken unto u in the name of the lord we will not hearken unto thee but we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth to burn incense unto the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offering unto her a we have do we and our father our king and our prince in the city of judah and in the street of jerusalem for then have we plenty of victual and be well and saw no evil but since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offering unto her we have want all thing and have be consume by the sword and by the famine and when we burn incense to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offering unto her do we make her cake to worship her and pour out drink offering unto her

street of jerusalem ye and your father your king and your prince and the people of the land do not the lord remember them and come it not into his mind so that the lord could no longer bear because of the evil of your doings and because of the abomination which ye have commit therefore be your land desolation and an astonishment and curse without an inhabitant a at this day because ye have burn incense and because ye have sin against the lord and have not obeyed the voice of the lord nor walk in his law nor in his statute nor in his testimony therefore this evil be happen unto you a at this

which be on the east side of the city afterwards the spirit take me up and brought me in vision by the spirit of god into chaldea to them of the captivity so the vision that have see go up from me then spake unto them of the captivity all the thing that the lord have shew me the word of the lord also come unto me say son of man thou dwellest in the midst of rebellious house which have eye to

that be among them say be your sign like a have do so shall it be do unto them they shall remove and go into captivity and the prince that be among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the twilight and shall go forth they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby he shall cover his face that he see not the ground with his eye my net also will spread upon him and he shall be take in my snare and will bring him to babylon to the land of the chaldean yet shall he not see it though he shall die there and will scatter toward every wind all that be about him to help him and all his band and will draw out the sword after them and they shall know that be the lord when shall scatter them among the nation and disperse them in the country but will leave few men of them from the sword from the famine and from the pestilence that they may declare all their abomination among the heathen whither they come and they shall know that be the lord moreover the word of the lord come to me say son of man eat thy bread with quake and drink thy water with tremble and with carefulness and say unto the people of the land thus saith the lord god of the inhabitant of jerusalem and of the land of israel they shall eat their bread with carefulness and drink their water with astonishment that her land may be desolate from all that be therein because of the violence of all them that dwell therein and the city that be inhabit shall be laid waste and the land shall be desolate and ye shall know that be the lord and the word of the lord come unto me say son of man what be that proverb that ye have in the land of israel say the day be prolong and every vision faileth tell them therefore thus saith the lord god will make this proverb to cease and they shall no more use it a proverb in israel but say unto them the day be at hand and the effect of every vision for there shall be no more any vain vision nor flatter divination within the house of israel for be the lord will speak and the word that shall speak shall come to pas it shall be no more prolong for in your day rebellious house will say the word and will perform it saith the lord god again the word of the lord come to me say son of man behold they of the house of israel say the vision that he seeth be for many day to come and he prophesieth of the time that be far off therefore say unto them thus saith the lord god there shall none of my word be prolong any more but the word which have spoken shall be do saith the lord god and the word of the lord come unto me say son of man prophesy against the prophet of israel that prophesy and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own heart hear ye the word of the lord thus saith the lord god woe unto the foolish prophet that follow their own spirit and have see nothing israel thy prophet be like the fox in the desert ye have not go up into the gap neither make up the hedge for the house of israel to stand in the battle in the day of the lord they have see vanity and lie divination say the lord saith and the lord hath not sent them and they have make others to hope that they would confirm the word have ye not see vain vision and have ye not spoken lie divination whereas ye say the lord saith it albeit have not spoken therefore thus saith the lord god because ye have spoken vanity and see lie therefore behold be against you saith the lord god and mine hand shall be upon the prophet that see vanity and that divine lie they shall not be in the assembly of my people neither shall they be write in the write of the house of israel neither shall they enter into the land of israel and ye shall know that be the lord god because even because they have seduce my people say peace and there be no peace and one built up wall and lo others daubed it with untempered morter say unto them which daub it with untempered morter that it shall fall there shall be an overflow shower and ye great hailstone shall fall and stormy wind shall rend it lo when the wall be fall shall it not be say unto you where be the daub wherewith ye have daubed it therefore thus saith the lord god will even rend it with stormy wind in my fury and there shall be an overflow shower in mine anger and great hailstone in my fury to consume it so will break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered morter and bring it down to the ground so that the foundation thereof shall be discover and it shall fall and ye shall be consume in the midst thereof and ye shall know that be the lord thus will accomplish my wrath upon the wall and upon them that have daubed it with untempered morter and will say unto you the wall be no more neither they that daubed it to wit the prophet of israel which prophesy concern jerusalem and which see vision of peace for her and there be no peace saith the lord god likewise thou son of man set thy face against the daughter of thy people which prophesy out of their own heart and prophesy thou against them and say thus saith the lord god woe to the woman that sew pillow to all armhole and make kerchief upon the head of every stature to hunt soul will ye hunt the soul of my people and will ye save the soul alive that come unto you and will ye pollute me among my people for handful of barley and for piece of bread to slay the soul that should not die and to save the soul alive that should not live by your lie to my people that hear your lie wherefore thus saith the lord god behold be against your pillow wherewith ye there hunt the soul to make them fly and will tear them from your arm and will let the soul go even the soul that ye hunt to make them fly your kerchief also will tear and deliver my people out of your hand and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunt and ye shall know that be the lord because with lie ye have make the heart of the righteous sad whom have not make sad and strengthen the hand of the wicked that he should not return from his wicked way by promising him life therefore ye shall see no more vanity nor divine divination for will deliver my people out of your hand and ye shall know that be the lord then come certain of the elder of israel unto me and sat before me and the word of the lord come unto me say son of man these men have set up their idol in their heart and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face should be enquire of at all by them therefore speak unto them and say unto them thus saith the lord god every man of the house of israel that setteth up his idol in his heart and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face and cometh to the prophet the lord will answer him that cometh accord to the multitude of his idol that may take the house of israel in their own heart because they be all estrange from me through their idol therefore say unto the house of israel thus saith the lord god repent and turn yourselves from your idol and turn away your face from all your abomination for every one of the house of israel or of the stranger that sojourneth in israel which separateth himself from me and setteth up his idol in his heart and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face and cometh to prophet to enquire of him concern me the lord will answer him by myself and will set my face against that man and will make him sign and proverb and will cut him off from the midst of my people and ye shall know that be the lord and if the prophet be deceive when he hath spoken thing the lord have deceive that prophet and will stretch out my hand upon him and will destroy him from the midst of my people israel and they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity the punishment of the prophet shall be even a the punishment of him that seeketh unto him that the house of israel may go no more astray from me neither be pollute any more with all their transgression but that they may be my people and may be their god saith the lord god the word of the lord come again to me say son of man when the land sinneth against me by trespass grievously then will stretch out mine hand upon it and will break the staff of the bread thereof and will send famine upon it and will cut off man and beast from it though these three men noah daniel and job be in it they should deliver but their own soul by their righteousness saith the lord god if cause noisome beast to pas through the land and they spoil it so that it be desolate that no man may pas through because of the beast though these three men be in it a live saith the lord god they shall deliver neither son nor daughter they only shall be deliver but the land shall be desolate or if bring sword upon that land and say sword go through the land so that cut off man and beast from it though these three men be in it a live saith the lord god they shall deliver neither son nor daughter but they only shall be deliver themselves or if send pestilence into that land and pour out my fury upon it in blood to cut off from it man and beast though noah daniel and job be in it a live saith the lord god they shall deliver neither son nor daughter they shall but deliver their own soul by their righteousness for thus saith the lord god how much more when send my four sore judgment upon jerusalem the sword and the famine and the noisome beast and the pestilence to cut off from it man and beast yet behold therein shall be left remnant that shall be brought forth both son and daughter behold they shall come forth unto you and ye shall see their way and their doings and ye shall be comfort concern the evil that have brought upon jerusalem even concern all that have brought upon it and they shall comfort you when ye see their way and their doings and ye shall know that have not do without cause all that have do in it saith the lord god and the word of the lord come unto me say son of man what be the vine tree more than any tree or than branch which be among the tree of the forest shall wood be take thereof to do any work or will men take pin of it to hang any vessel thereon behold it be cast into the fire for fuel the fire devoureth both the end of it and the midst of it be burn be it meet for any work behold when it be whole it be meet for no work how much less shall it be meet yet for any work when the fire hath devour it and it be burn therefore thus saith the lord god a the vine tree among the tree of the forest which have give to the fire for fuel so will give the inhabitant of jerusalem and will set my face against them they shall go out from one fire and another fire shall devour them and ye shall know that be the lord when set my face against them and will make the land desolate because they have commit trespass saith the lord god again the word of the lord come unto me say son of man cause jerusalem to know her abomination and say thus saith the lord god unto jerusalem thy birth and thy nativity be of the land of canaan thy father be an amorite and thy mother an hittite and a for thy nativity in the day thou wast born thy navel be not cut neither wast thou wash in water to supple thee thou wast not salt at all nor swaddle at all none eye pity thee to do any of these unto thee to have compassion upon thee but thou

yea say unto thee when thou wast in thy blood live have cause thee to multiply a the bud of the field and thou hast increase and waxen great and thou art come to excellent ornament thy breast be fashion and thine hair be grown whereas thou wast naked and bare now when pass by thee and look upon thee behold thy time be the time of love and spread my skirt over thee and cover thy nakedness yea sware unto thee and enter into covenant with thee saith the lord god and thou becamest mine then wash thee with water yea throughly wash away thy blood from thee and anoint thee with oil clothed thee also with broider work and shod thee with badger skin and gird thee about with fine linen and cover thee with silk deck thee also with ornament and put bracelet upon thy hand and chain on thy neck and

saith the lord god and the word of the lord come unto me say son of man put forth riddle and speak parable unto the house of israel and say thus saith the lord god great eagle with great wing longwinged full of feather which have diver colour come unto lebanon and take the high branch of the cedar he cropped off the top of his young twig and carry it into land of traffick he set it in city of merchant he take also of the seed of the land and plant it in fruitful field he place it by great water and set it a willow tree and it grow and become spread vine of low stature whose branch turn toward him and the root thereof be under him so it become vine and brought forth branch and shot forth sprig there be also another great eagle with great wing and many feather and behold this vine do bend her root toward him and shot forth her branch toward him that he might water it by the furrow of her plantation it be plant in good soil by great water that it might bring forth branch and that it might bear fruit that it might be goodly vine say thou thus saith the lord god shall it prosper shall he not pull up the root thereof and cut off the fruit thereof that it wither it shall wither in all the leaf of her spring even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the root thereof yea behold be plant shall it prosper shall it not utterly wither when the east wind toucheth it it shall wither in the furrow where it grow moreover the word of the lord come unto me say say now to the rebellious house know ye not what these thing mean tell them behold the king of babylon be come to jerusalem and hath take the king thereof and the prince thereof and lead them with him to babylon and hath take of the king seed and make covenant with him and hath take an oath of him he hath also take the mighty of the land that the kingdom might be base that it might not lift itself up but that by keep of his covenant it might stand but he rebel against him in send his ambassador into egypt that they might give him horse and much people shall he prosper shall he escape that doeth such thing or shall he break the covenant and be deliver a live saith the lord god surely in the place where the king dwelleth that make him king whose oath he despise and whose covenant he brake even with him in the midst of babylon he shall die neither shall pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war by cast up mount and building fort to cut off many person see he despise the oath by break the covenant when lo he have give his hand and hath do all these thing he shall not escape therefore thus saith the lord god a live surely mine oath that he hath despise and my covenant that he hath broken even it will recompense upon his own head and will spread my net upon him and he shall be take in my snare and will bring him to babylon and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespass against me and all his fugitive with all his band shall fall by the sword and they that remain shall be scatter toward all wind and ye shall know that the lord have spoken it thus saith the lord god will also take of the high branch of the high cedar and will set it will crop off from the top of his young twig tender one and will plant it upon an high mountain and eminent in the mountain of the height of israel will plant it and it shall bring forth bough and bear fruit and be goodly cedar and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing in the shadow of the branch thereof shall they dwell and all the tree of the field shall know that the lord have brought down the high tree have exalt the low tree have dry up the green tree and have make the dry tree to flourish the lord have spoken and have do it the word of the lord come unto me again say what mean ye that ye use this proverb concern the land of israel say the father have eat sour grape and the child teeth be set on edge a live saith the lord god ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in israel behold all soul be mine a the soul of the father so also the soul of the son be mine the soul that sinneth it shall die but if man be just and do that which be lawful and right and hath not eat upon the mountain neither hath lift up his eye to the idol of the house of israel neither hath defile his neighbour wife neither hath come near to menstruous woman and hath not oppress any but hath restore to the debtor his pledge hath spoil none by violence hath give his bread to the hungry and hath cover the naked with garment he that hath not give forth upon usury neither hath take any increase that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity hath execute true judgment between man and man hath walk in my statute and hath kept my judgment to deal truly he be just he shall surely live saith the lord god if he beget son that be robber shedder of blood and that doeth the like to any one of these thing and that doeth not any of those duty but even hath eat upon the mountain and defile his neighbour wife hath oppress the poor and needy hath spoil by violence hath not restore the pledge and hath lift up his eye to the idol hath commit abomination hath give forth upon usury and hath take increase shall he then live he shall not live he hath do all these abomination he shall surely die his blood shall be upon him now lo if he beget son that seeth all his father sin which he hath do and considereth and doeth not such like that hath not eat upon the mountain neither hath lift up his eye to the idol of the house of israel hath not defile his neighbour wife neither hath oppress any hath not withholden the pledge neither hath spoil by violence but hath give his bread to the hungry and hath cover the naked with garment that hath take off his hand from the poor that

spoil his brother by violence and do that which be not good among his people lo even he shall die in his iniquity yet say ye why doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father when the son hath do that which be lawful and right and hath kept all my statute and hath do them he shall surely live the soul that sinneth it shall die the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him but if the wicked will turn from all his sin that he hath commit and keep all my statute and do that which be lawful and right he shall surely live he shall not die all his transgression that he hath commit they shall not be mention unto him in his righteousness that he hath do he shall live have any pleasure at all that the wicked should die saith the lord god and not that he should return from his way and live but when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness and committeth iniquity and doeth accord to all the abomination that the wicked man doeth shall he live all his righteousness that he hath do shall not be mention in his trespass that he hath trespass and in his sin that he hath sin in them shall he die yet ye say the way of the lord be not equal hear now house of israel be not my way equal be not your way unequal when righteous man turneth away from his righteousness and committeth iniquity and dieth in them for his iniquity that he hath do shall he die again when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath commit and doeth that which be lawful and right he shall save his soul alive because he considereth and turneth away from all his transgression that he hath commit he shall surely live he shall not die yet saith the house of israel the way of the lord be not equal house of israel be not my way equal be not your way unequal therefore will judge you house of israel every one accord to his way saith the lord god repent and turn yourselves from all your transgression so iniquity shall not be your ruin cast away from you all your transgression whereby ye have transgress and make you new heart and new spirit for why will ye die house of israel for have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth saith the lord god wherefore turn yourselves and live ye moreover take thou up lamentation for the prince of israel and say what be thy mother lioness she lay down among lion she nourish her whelp among young lion and she brought up one of her whelp it become young lion and it learn to catch the prey it devour men the nation also heard of him he be take in their pit and they brought him with chain unto the land of egypt now when she saw that she have wait and her

them in their own gift in that they cause to pas through the fire all that openeth the womb that might make them desolate to the end that they might know that be the lord therefore son of man speak unto the house of israel and say unto them thus saith the lord god yet in this your father have blaspheme me in that they have commit trespass against me for when have brought them into the land for the which lift up mine hand to give it to them then they saw every high hill and all the thick tree and they offer there their sacrifice and there they present the provocation of their offering there

them with the fire of my wrath their own way have recompense upon their head saith the lord god the word of the lord come again unto me say son of man there be two woman the daughter of one mother and they commit whoredom in egypt they commit whoredom in their youth there be their breast press and there they bruise the teat of their virginity and the name of them be aholah the elder and aholibah her sister and they be mine and they bare son and daughter thus be their name samaria be aholah and jerusalem aholibah and aholah played the harlot when she be mine and she dot on her lover on the assyrian her neighbour which be clothed with blue captain and ruler all of them desirable young men horseman rid upon horse thus she commit her whoredom with them with all them that be the chosen men of assyria and with all on whom she dot with all their idol she defile herself neither left she her whoredom brought from egypt for in her youth they lay with her and they bruise the breast of her virginity and pour their whoredom upon her wherefore have deliver her into the hand of her lover into the hand of the assyrian upon whom she dot these discover her nakedness they take her son and her daughter and slew her with the sword and she become famous among woman for they have execute judgment upon her and when her sister aholibah saw this she be more corrupt in her inordinate love than she

israel prophesy and say unto them thus saith the lord god unto the shepherd woe be to the shepherd of israel that do feed themselves should not the shepherd feed the flock ye eat the fat and ye clothe you with the wool ye kill them that be fed but ye feed not the flock the diseased have ye not strengthen neither have ye heal that which be sick neither have ye bound up that which be broken neither have ye brought again that which be driven away neither have ye sought that which be lose but with force and with cruelty have ye rule them and they be scatter because there be no shepherd and they become meat to all the beast of the field when they be scatter my sheep wander through all the mountain and upon every high hill yea my flock be scatter upon all the face of the earth and none do search or seek after them therefore ye shepherd hear the word of the lord a live saith the lord god surely because my flock become prey and my flock become meat to every beast of the field because there be no shepherd neither do my shepherd search for my flock but the shepherd fed themselves and fed not my flock therefore ye shepherd hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord god behold be against the shepherd and will require my flock at their hand and cause them to cease from feed the flock neither shall the shepherd feed themselves any more for will deliver my flock from their mouth that they may not be meat for them for thus saith the lord god behold even will both search my sheep and seek them out a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he be among his sheep that be scatter so will seek out my sheep and will deliver them out of all place where they have be scatter in the cloudy and dark day and will bring them out from the people and gather them from the country and will bring them to their own land and feed them upon the mountain of israel by the river and in all the inhabit place of the country will feed them in good pasture and upon the high mountain of israel shall their fold be there shall they lie in good fold and in fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountain of israel will feed my flock and will cause them to lie down saith the lord god will

with judgment and a for you my flock thus saith the lord god behold judge between cattle and cattle between the ram and the he goat seemeth it small thing unto you to have eat up the good pasture but ye must tread down with your foot the residue of your pasture and to have drunk of the deep water but ye must foul the residue with your foot and a for my flock they eat that which ye have trodden with your foot and they drink that which ye have foul with your foot therefore thus saith the lord god unto them behold even will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder and push all the diseased with your horn till ye have scatter them abroad therefore will save my flock and they shall no more be prey and will judge between cattle and cattle and will set up one shepherd over them and he shall feed them even my servant david he shall feed them and he shall be their shepherd and the lord will be their god and my servant david prince among them the lord have spoken it and will make with them covenant of peace and will cause the evil beast to cease out of the land and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness and sleep

part of clay thou sawest till that stone be cut out without hand which smote the image upon his foot that be of iron and clay and brake them to piece then be the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken to piece together and become like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors and the wind carry them away that no place be found for them and the stone that smote the image become great mountain and fill the whole earth this be the dream and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king thou king art king of king for the god of heaven hath give thee kingdom power and strength and glory and wheresoever the child of men dwell the beast of the field and the fowl of the heaven hath he give into thine hand and hath make thee ruler over them all thou art this head of gold and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee and another third kingdom of brass which shall bear rule over all the earth and the fourth kingdom shall be strong a iron forasmuch a iron breaketh in piece and subdueth all thing and a iron that breaketh all these shall it break in piece and bruise and whereas thou sawest the foot and toe part of potter clay and part of iron the kingdom shall be divide but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron forasmuch a thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay and a the toe of the foot be part of iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken and whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another even a iron be not mixed with clay and in the day of these king shall the god of heaven set up kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in

the judgment be set and the book be open beheld then because of the voice of the great word which the horn spake beheld even till the beast be slain and his body destroyed and give to the burning flame a concern the rest of the beast they have their dominion take away yet their life be prolong for season and time saw in the night vision and behold one like the son of man come with the cloud of heaven and come to the ancient of day and they brought him near before him and there be give him dominion and glory and kingdom that all people nation and language should serve him his dominion be an everlasting dominion which shall not pas away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed daniel be grieve in my spirit in the midst of my body and the vision of my head troubled me come near unto one of them that stood by and ask him the truth of all this so he told me and make me know the interpretation of the thing these great beast which be four be four king which shall arise out of the earth but the saint of the most high shall take the kingdom and posse the kingdom for ever even for ever and ever then would know the truth of the fourth beast which be diverse from all the others exceed dreadful whose teeth be of iron and his nail of brass which devour brake in piece and stamp the residue with his foot and of the ten horn that be in his head and of the other which come up and before whom three fell even of that horn that have eye and mouth that spake very great thing whose look be more stout than his fellow beheld and the same horn make war with the saint and prevail

and to destroy it unto the end and the kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven shall be give to the people of the saint of the most high whose kingdom be an everlasting kingdom and all dominion shall serve and obey him hitherto be the end of the matter a for me daniel my cogitation much troubled me and my countenance change in me but kept the matter in my heart in the third year of the reign of king belshazzar vision appear unto me even unto me daniel after that which appear unto me at the first and saw in vision and it come to pas when saw that be at shushan in the palace which be in the province of elam and saw in vision and be by the river of ulai then lift up mine eye and saw and behold there stood before the river ram which have two horn and the two horn be high but one be high than the other and the high come up last saw the ram push westward and northward and southward so that no beast might stand before him neither be there any that could deliver out of his hand but he do accord to his will and become great and a be consider behold an he goat come from the west on the face of the whole earth and touch not the ground and the goat have notable horn between his eye and he come to the ram that have two horn which have see stand before the river and ran unto him in the fury of his power and saw him come close unto the ram and he be move with choler against him and smote the ram and brake his two horn and there be no power in the ram to stand before him but he cast him down to the ground and stamp upon him and there be none that could deliver the ram out of his hand therefore the he goat waxed very great and when he be strong the great horn be broken and for it come up four notable one toward the four wind of heaven and out of one of them come forth little horn which waxed exceed great toward the south and toward the east and toward the pleasant land and it waxed great even to the host of heaven and it cast down some

down and an host be give him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression and it cast down the truth to the ground and it practise and prosper then heard one saint speak and another saint say unto that certain saint which spake how long shall be the vision concern the daily sacrifice and the transgression of desolation to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot and he say unto me unto two thousand and three hundred day then shall the sanctuary be cleanse and it come to pas when even daniel have see the vision and sought for the meaning then behold there stood before me a the appearance of man and heard man voice between the bank of ulai which call and say gabriel make this man to understand the vision so he come near where stood and when he come be afraid and fell upon my face but he say unto me understand son of man for at the time of the end shall be the vision now a he be speak with me be in deep sleep on my face toward the ground but he touch me and set me upright and he say behold will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation for at the time appoint the end shall be the ram which thou sawest have two horn be the king of medium and persia and the rough goat be the king of grecia and the great horn that be between his eye be the first king now that be broken whereas four stood up for it four kingdom shall

barley and say unto her thou shalt abide for me many day thou shalt not play the harlot and thou shalt not be for another man so will also be for thee for the child of israel shall abide many day without king and without prince and without sacrifice and without an image and without an ephod and without teraphim afterward shall the child of israel return and seek the lord their god and david their king and shall fear the lord and his goodness in the latter day hear the word of the lord ye child of israel for the lord hath controversy with the inhabitant of the land because there be no truth nor mercy nor knowledge of god in the land by swear and lie and kill and steal and commit adultery they break out and blood toucheth blood therefore shall the land mourn and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish with the beast of the field and with the fowl of heaven yea the fish of the sea also shall be take away yet let no man strive nor reprove another for thy people be a they that strive with the priest therefore shalt thou fall in the day and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night and will destroy thy mother my people be destroyed for lack of knowledge because thou hast reject knowledge will also reject thee that thou shalt be no priest to me see thou hast forgotten the law of thy god will also forget thy child a they be increase so they sin against me therefore will change their glory into shame they eat up the sin of my people and they set their heart on their iniquity and there shall be like people like priest and will punish them for their way and reward them their doings for they shall eat and not have enough they shall commit whoredom and shall not increase because they have left off to take heed to the lord whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart my people ask counsel at their stock and their staff declareth unto them for the spirit of whoredom hath cause them to err and they have go whore from under their god they sacrifice upon the top of the mountain and burn incense upon the hill under oak and poplar and elm because the shadow thereof be good therefore your daughter shall commit whoredom and your spouse shall commit adultery will not punish your daughter when they commit whoredom nor your spouse when they commit adultery for themselves be separate with whore and they sacrifice with harlot therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall though thou israel play the harlot yet let not judah offend and come not ye unto gilgal neither go ye up to bethaven nor swear the lord liveth for israel slideth back a backsliding heifer now the lord will feed them a lamb in large place ephraim be join to idol let him alone their drink be sour they have commit whoredom continually her ruler with shame do love give ye the wind hath bound her up in her wing and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifice hear ye this priest and hearken ye house of israel and give ye ear house of the king for

hid from me for now ephraim thou committest whoredom and israel be defile they will not frame their doings to turn unto their god for the spirit of whoredom be in the midst of them and they have not know the lord and the pride of israel doth testify to his face therefore shall israel and ephraim fall in their iniquity judah also shall fall with them they shall go with their flock and with their herd to seek the lord but they shall not find him he hath withdrawn himself from them they have dealt treacherously against the lord for they have begotten strange child now shall month devour them with their portion blow ye the cornet in gibeah and the trumpet in ramah cry aloud at bethaven after thee benjamin ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke among the tribe of israel have make know that which shall surely be the prince of judah be like them that remove the bound therefore will pour out my wrath upon them like water ephraim be oppress and broken in judgment because he willingly walk after the commandment therefore will be unto ephraim a moth and to the house of judah a rottenness when ephraim saw his sickness and judah saw his wound then go ephraim to the assyrian and sent to king jareb yet could he not heal you nor cure you of your wound for will be unto ephraim a lion and a young lion to the house of judah even will tear and go away will take away and none shall rescue him will go and return to my place till they acknowledge their offence and seek my face in their affliction they will seek me early come and let u return unto the lord for he hath torn

the lord his go forth be prepared a the morning and he shall come unto u a the rain a the latter and former rain unto the earth ephraim what shall do unto thee judah what shall do unto thee for your goodness be a morning cloud and a the early dew it goeth away therefore have hew them by the prophet have slain them by the word of my mouth and thy judgment be a the light that goeth forth for desire mercy and not sacrifice and the knowledge of god more than burnt offering but they like men have transgress the covenant there have they dealt treacherously against me gilead be city of them that work

have flee from me destruction unto them because they have transgress against me though have redeem them yet they have spoken lie against me and they have not cry unto me with their heart when they howl upon their bed they assemble themselves for corn and wine and they rebel against me though have bound and strengthen their arm yet do they imagine mischief against me they return but not to the most high they be like deceitful bow their prince shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue this shall be their derision in the land of egypt set the trumpet to thy mouth he shall come a an eagle against the house of the lord because they have transgress my covenant and trespass against my law israel shall cry unto me my god we know thee israel hath cast off the thing that be good the

land to fail say when will the new moon be go that we may sell corn and the sabbath that we may set forth wheat make the ephah small and the shekel great and falsify the balance by deceit that we may buy the poor for silver and the needy for pair of shoe yea and sell the refuse of the wheat the lord hath sworn by the excellency of jacob surely will never forget any of their work shall not the land tremble for this and every one mourn that dwelleth therein and it shall rise up wholly a flood and it shall be cast out and drown a by the flood of egypt and it shall come to pas in that day saith the lord god that will cause the sun to go down at noon and will darken the earth in the clear day and will turn your feast into mourn and all your song into lamentation and will bring up sackcloth upon all loin and baldness upon every head and will make it a the mourn of an only son and the end thereof a bitter day behold the day come saith the lord god that will send famine in the land not famine of bread nor thirst for water but of hearing the word of the lord and they shall wander from sea to sea and from the north even to the east they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the lord and

fall and never rise up again saw the lord stand upon the altar and he say smite the lintel of the door that the post may shake and cut them in the head all of them and will slay the last of them with the sword he that fleeth of them shall not flee away and he that escapeth of them shall not be deliver though they dig into hell thence shall mine hand take them though they climb up to heaven thence will bring them down and though they hide themselves in the top of carmel will search and take them out thence and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea thence will command the serpent and he shall bite them and though they go into captivity before their enemy thence will command the sword and it shall slay them and will set mine eye upon them for evil and not for good and

his disciple come unto him and he open his mouth and taught them say bless be the poor in spirit for theirs be the kingdom of heaven bless be they that mourn for they shall be comfort bless be the meek for they shall inherit the earth bless be they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be fill bless be the merciful for they shall obtain mercy bless be the pure in heart for they shall see god bless be the peacemaker for they shall be call the child of god bless be they which be persecute for righteousness sake for theirs be the kingdom of heaven bless be ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceed glad for great be your reward in heaven for so persecute they the prophet which be before you ye be the salt of the earth but if the salt have lose his savour wherewith shall it be salt it be thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men ye be the light of the world city that be set on an hill cannot be hid neither do men light candle and put it under bushel but on candlestick and it giveth light unto all that be in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good work and glorify your father which be in heaven think not that be come to destroy the law or the prophet be not come to destroy but to fulfil for verily say unto you till heaven and earth pas one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pas from the law till all be fulfil whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandment and shall teach men so he shall be call the least in the kingdom of heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same shall be call great in the kingdom of heaven for say unto you that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribe and pharisee ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven ye have heard that it be say of them of old time thou shalt not kill and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment but say unto you that whosoever be angry with his brother without cause shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoever shall say to his brother raca shall be in danger of the council but whosoever shall say thou fool shall be in danger of hell fire therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee leave there thy gift before the altar and go thy way first be reconcile to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift agree with thine adversary quickly while thou art in the way with him l at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge and the judge deliver thee to the officer and thou be cast into prison verily say unto thee thou shalt by no mean come out thence till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing ye have heard that it be say by them of old time thou shalt not commit adultery but say unto you that whosoever looketh on woman to lust after her hath commit adultery with her already in his heart and if thy right eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee for it be profitable for thee that one of thy member should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell and if thy right hand offend thee cut it off and cast it from thee for it be profitable for thee that one of thy member should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell it hath be say whosoever shall put away his wife let him give her write of divorcement but say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife save for the cause of fornication causeth her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that be divorce committeth adultery again ye have heard that it hath be say by them of old time thou shalt not forswear thyself but shalt perform unto the lord thine oath but say unto you swear not at all neither by heaven for it be god throne nor by the earth for it be his footstool neither by jerusalem for it be the city of the great king neither shalt thou swear by thy head because thou canst not make one hair white or black but let your communication be yea yea nay nay for whatsoever be more than these cometh of evil ye have heard that it hath be say an eye for an eye and tooth for tooth but say unto you that ye resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compel thee to go mile go with him twain give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away ye have heard that it hath be say thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy but say unto you love your enemy bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that ye may be the child of your father which be in heaven for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust for if ye love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publican the same and if ye salute your brother only what do ye more than others do not even the publican so be ye therefore perfect even a your father which be in heaven be perfect take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be see of them otherwise ye have no reward of your father which be in heaven therefore when thou doest thine alms do not sound trumpet before thee a the hypocrite do in the synagogue and in the street that they may have glory of men verily say unto you they have their reward but when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth that thine alms may be in secret and thy father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly and when thou prayest thou shalt not be a the hypocrite be for they love to pray stand in the synagogue and in the corner of the street that they may be see of men verily say unto you they have their reward but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou hast shut thy door pray to thy father which be in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly but when ye pray use not vain repetition a the heathen do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speak be not ye therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what thing ye have need of before ye ask him after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven hallow be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be do in earth a it be in heaven give u this day our daily bread and forgive u our debt a we forgive our debtor and lead u not into temptation but deliver u from evil for thine be the kingdom and the power and the glory for ever amen for if ye forgive men their trespass your heavenly father will also forgive you but if ye forgive not men their trespass neither will your father forgive your trespass moreover when ye fast be not a the hypocrite of sad countenance for they disfigure their face that they may appear unto men to fast verily say unto you they have their reward but thou when thou fast anoint thine head and wash thy face that thou appear not unto men to fast but unto thy father which be in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly lay not up for yourselves treasure upon earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thief break through and steal but lay up for yourselves treasure in heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thief do not break through nor steal for where your treasure be there will your heart be also the light of the body be the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness if therefore the light that be in thee be darkness how great be that darkness no man can serve two master for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon therefore say unto you take no thought for your life what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink nor yet for your body what ye shall put on be not the life more than meat and the body than raiment behold the fowl of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barn yet your heavenly father feedeth them be ye not much well than they which of you by take thought can add one cubit unto his stature and why take ye thought for raiment consider the lily of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin and yet say unto you that even solomon in all his glory be not arrayed like one of these wherefore if god so clothe the grass of the field which to day be and to morrow be cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you ye of little faith therefore take no thought say what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be clothed for after all these thing do the gentile seek for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these thing but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these thing shall be add unto you take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the thing of itself sufficient unto the day be the evil thereof judge not that ye be not judged for with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged and with what measure ye mete it shall be measure to you again and why beholdest thou the mote that be in thy brother eye but considerest not the beam that be in thine own eye or how wilt thou say to thy brother let me pull out the mote out of thine eye and behold beam be in thine own eye thou hypocrite first cast out the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother eye give not that which be holy unto the dog neither cast ye your pearl before swine l they trample them under their foot and turn again and rend you ask and it shall be give you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be open unto you for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be open or what man be there of you whom if his son ask bread will he give him stone or if he ask fish will he give him serpent if ye then be evil know how to give good gift unto your child how much more shall your father which be in heaven give good thing to them that ask him therefore all thing whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them for this be the law and the prophet enter ye in at the strait gate for wide be the gate and broad be the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in thereat because strait be the gate and narrow be the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it beware of false prophet which come to you in sheep clothing but inwardly they be raven wolf ye shall know them by their fruit do men gather grape of thorn or fig of thistle even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit be hewn down and cast into the fire wherefore by their fruit ye shall know them not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which be in heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesy in thy name and in thy name have cast out devil and in thy name do many wonderful work and then will profess unto them never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity therefore whosoever heareth these saying of mine and doeth them will liken him unto wise man which built his house upon rock and the rain descend and the flood come and the wind blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it be found upon rock and every one that heareth these saying of mine and doeth them not shall be liken unto foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descend and the flood come and the wind blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great be the fall of it and it come to pas when jesus have end these saying the people be astonish at his doctrine for he taught them a one have authority and not a the scribe when he be come down from the mountain great multitude follow him and behold there come leper and worship him say lord if thou wilt thou canst make me clean and jesus put forth his hand and touch him say will be thou clean and immediately his leprosy be cleanse and jesus saith unto him see thou tell no man but go thy way shew thyself to the priest and offer the gift that moses command for testimony unto them and when jesus be enter into capernaum there come unto him centurion beseeching him and say lord my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy grievously torment and jesus saith unto him will come and heal him the centurion answer and say lord be not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be heal for be man under authority have soldier under me and say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it when jesus heard it he marvel and say to them that follow verily say unto you have not found so great faith no not in israel and say unto you that many shall come from the east and west and shall sit down with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven but the child of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness there shall be weep and gnash of teeth and jesus say unto the centurion go thy way and a thou hast believe so be it do unto thee and his servant be heal in the selfsame hour and when jesus be come into peter house he saw his wife mother laid and sick of fever and he touch her hand and the fever left her and she arose and minister unto them when the even be come they brought unto him many that be possess with devil and he cast out the spirit with his word and heal all that be sick that it might be fulfil which be spoken by esaias the prophet say himself take our infirmity and bare our sickness now when jesus saw great multitude about him he give commandment to depart unto the other side and certain scribe come and say unto him master will follow thee whithersoever thou goest and jesus saith unto him the fox have hole and the bird of the air have nest but the son of man hath not where to lay his head and another of his disciple say unto him lord suffer me first to go and bury my father but jesus say unto him follow me and let the dead bury their dead and when he be enter into ship his disciple follow him and behold there arose great tempest in the sea insomuch that the ship be cover with the wave but he be asleep and his disciple come to him and awoke him say lord save u we perish and he saith unto them why be ye fearful ye of little faith then he arose and rebuke the wind and the sea and there be great calm but the men marvel say what manner of man be this that even the wind and the sea obey him and when he be come to the other side into the country of the gergesenes there met him two possess with devil come out of the tomb exceed fierce so that no man might pas by that way and behold they cry out say what have we to do with thee jesus thou son of god art thou come hither to torment u before the time and there be good way off from them an herd of many swine feed so the devil besought him say if thou cast u out suffer u to go away into the herd of swine and he say unto them go and when they be come out they go into the herd of swine and behold the whole herd of swine ran violently down steep place into the sea and perish in the water and they that kept them flee and go their way into the city and told every thing and what be befallen to the possess of the devil and behold the whole city come out to meet jesus and when they saw him they besought him that he would depart out of their coast and he enter into ship and pass over and come into his own city and behold they brought to him man sick of the palsy lie on bed and jesus see their faith say unto the sick of the palsy son be of good cheer thy sin be forgiven thee and behold certain of the scribe say within themselves this man blasphemeth and jesus know their thought say wherefore think ye evil in your heart for whether be easy to say thy sin be forgiven thee or to say arise and walk but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sin then saith he to the sick of the palsy arise take up thy bed and go unto thine house and he arose and depart to his house but when the multitude saw it they marvel and glorify god which have give such power unto men and a jesus pass forth from thence he saw man name matthew sit at the receipt of custom and he saith unto him follow me and he arose and follow him and it come to pas a jesus sat at meat in the house behold many publican and sinner come and sat down with him and his disciple and when the pharisee saw it they say unto his disciple why eateth your master with publican and sinner but when jesus heard that he say unto them they that be whole need not physician but they that be sick but go ye and learn what that meaneth will have mercy and not sacrifice for be not come to call the righteous but sinner to repentance then come to him the disciple of john say why do we and the pharisee fast oft but thy disciple fast not and jesus say unto them can the child of the bridechamber mourn a long a the bridegroom be with them but the day will come when the bridegroom shall be take from them and then shall they fast no man putteth piece of new cloth unto an old garment for that which be put in to fill it up taketh from the garment and the rent be make bad neither do men put new wine into old bottle else the bottle break and the wine runneth out and the bottle perish but they put new wine into new bottle and both be preserve while he spake these thing unto them behold there come certain ruler and worship him say my daughter be even now dead but come and lay thy hand upon her and she shall live and jesus arose and follow him and so do his disciple and behold woman which be diseased with an issue of blood twelve year come behind him and touch the hem of his garment for she say within herself if may but touch his garment shall be whole but jesus turn him about and when he saw her he say daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath make thee whole and the woman be make whole from that hour and when jesus come into the ruler house and saw the minstrel and the people make noise he say unto them give place for the maid be not dead but sleepeth and they laugh him to scorn but when the people be put forth he go in and take her by the hand and the maid arose and the fame hereof go abroad into all that land and when jesus depart thence two blind men follow him cry and say thou son of david have mercy on u and when he be come into the house the blind men come to him and jesus saith unto them believe ye that be able to do this they say unto him yea lord then touch he their eye say accord to your faith be it unto you and their eye be open and jesus straitly charge them say see that no man know it but they when they be depart spread abroad his fame in all that country a they go out behold they brought to him dumb man possess with devil and when the devil be cast out the dumb spake and the multitude marvel say it be never so see in israel but the pharisee say he casteth out devil through the prince of the devil and jesus go about all the city and village teach in their synagogue and preach the gospel of the kingdom and heal every sickness and every disease among the people but when he saw the multitude he be move with compassion on them because they faint and be scatter abroad a sheep have no shepherd then saith he unto his disciple the harvest truly be plenteous but the labourer be few pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he will send forth labourer into his harvest and when he have call unto him his twelve disciple he give them power against unclean spirit to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease now the name of the twelve apostle be these the first simon who be call peter and andrew his brother james the son of zebedee and john his brother philip and bartholomew thomas and matthew the publican james the son of alphaeus and lebbaeus whose surname be thaddaeus simon the canaanite and juda iscariot who also betrayed him these twelve jesus sent forth and command them say go not into the way of the gentile and into any city of the samaritan enter ye not but go rather to the lose sheep of the house of israel and a ye go preach say the kingdom of heaven be at hand heal the sick cleanse the leper raise the dead cast out devil freely ye have receive freely give provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purse nor scrip for your journey neither two coat neither shoe nor yet stave for the workman be worthy of his meat and into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter enquire who in it be worthy and there abide till ye go thence and when ye come into an house salute it and if the house be worthy let your peace come upon it but if it be not worthy let your peace return to you and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear your word when ye depart out of that house or city shake off the dust of your foot verily say unto you it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom and gomorrha in the day of judgment than for that city behold send you forth a sheep in the midst of wolf be ye therefore wise a serpent and harmless a dove but beware of men for they will deliver you up to the council and they will scourge you in their synagogue and ye shall be brought before governor and king for my sake for testimony against them and the gentile but when they deliver you up take no thought how or what ye shall speak for it shall be give you in that same hour what ye shall speak for it be not ye that speak but the spirit of your father which speaketh in you and the brother shall deliver up the brother to death and the father the child and the child shall rise up against their parent and cause them to be put to death and ye shall be hat of all men for my name sake but he that endureth to the end shall be save but when they persecute you in this city flee ye into another for verily say unto you ye shall not have go over the city of israel till the son of man be come the disciple be not above his master nor the servant above his lord it be enough for the disciple that he be a his master and the servant a his lord if they have call the master of the house beelzebub how much more shall they call them of his household fear them not therefore for there be nothing cover that shall not be reveal and hid that shall not be know what tell you in darkness that speak ye in light and what ye hear in the ear that preach ye upon the housetop and fear not them which kill the body but be not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which be able to destroy both soul and body in hell be not two sparrow sell for farthing and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father but the very hair of your head be all numbered fear ye not therefore ye be of more value than many sparrow whosoever therefore shall confess me before men him will confess also before my father which be in heaven but whosoever shall deny me before men him will also deny before my father which be in heaven think not that be come to send peace on earth come not to send peace but sword for be come to set man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter in law against her mother in law and man foe shall be they of his own household he that loveth father or mother more than me be not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me be not worthy of me and he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me be not worthy of me he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me he that receiveth prophet in the name of prophet shall receive prophet reward and he that receiveth righteous man in the name of righteous man shall receive righteous man reward and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little one cup of cold water only in the name of disciple verily say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward and it come to pas when jesus have make an end of command his twelve disciple he depart thence to teach and to preach in their city now when john have heard in the prison the work of christ he sent two of his disciple and say unto him art thou he that should come or do we look for another jesus answer and say unto them go and shew john again those thing which ye do hear and see the blind receive their sight and the lame walk the leper be cleanse and the deaf hear the dead be raise up and the poor have the gospel preach to them and bless be he whosoever shall not be offend in me and a they depart jesus begin to say unto the multitude concern john what go ye out into the wilderness to see reed shaken with the wind but what go ye out for to see man clothed in soft raiment behold they that wear soft clothing be in king house but what go ye out for to see prophet yea say unto you and more than prophet for this be he of whom it be write behold send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee verily say unto you among them that be born of woman there hath not risen great than john the baptist notwithstanding he that be least in the kingdom of heaven be great than he and from the day of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force for all the prophet and the law prophesy until john and if ye will receive it this be elia which be for to come he that hath ear to hear let him hear but whereunto shall liken this generation it be like unto child sit in the market and call unto their fellow and say we have piped unto you and ye have not dance we have mourn unto you and ye have not lament for john come neither eat nor drinking and they say he hath devil the son of man come eat and drinking and they say behold man gluttonous and winebibber friend of publican and sinner but wisdom be justified of her child then begin he to upbraid the city wherein most of his mighty work be do because they repent not woe unto thee chorazin woe unto thee bethsaida for if the mighty work which be do in you have be do in tyre and sidon they would have repent long ago in sackcloth and ash but say unto you it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon at the day of judgment than for you and thou capernaum which art exalt unto heaven shalt be brought down to hell for if the mighty work which have be do in thee have be do in sodom it would have remain until this day but say unto you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom in the day of judgment than for thee at that time jesus answer and say thank thee father lord of heaven and earth because thou hast hid these thing from the wise and prudent and hast reveal them unto babe even so father for so it seem good in thy sight all thing be deliver unto me of my father and no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father save the son and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him come unto me all ye that labour and be heavy laden and will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for be meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your soul for my yoke be easy and my burden be light at that time jesus go on the sabbath day through the corn and his disciple be an hungred and begin to pluck the ear of corn and to eat but when the pharisee saw it they say unto him behold thy disciple do that which be not lawful to do upon the sabbath day but he say unto them have ye not read what david do when he be an hungred and they that be with him how he enter into the house of god and do eat the shewbread which be not lawful for him to eat neither for them which be with him but only for the priest or have ye not read in the law how that on the sabbath day the priest in the temple profane the sabbath and be blameless but say unto you that in this place be one great than the temple but if ye have know what this meaneth will have mercy and not sacrifice ye would not have condemn the guiltless for the son of man be lord even of the sabbath day and when he be depart thence he go into their synagogue and behold there be man which have his hand wither and they ask him say be it lawful to heal on the sabbath day that they might accuse him and he say unto them what man shall there be among you that shall have one sheep and if it fall into pit on the sabbath day will he not lay hold on it and lift it out how much then be man well than sheep wherefore it be lawful to do well on the sabbath day then saith he to the man stretch forth thine hand and he stretch it forth and it be restore whole like a the other then the pharisee go out and held council against him how they might destroy him but when jesus knew it he withdrew himself from thence and great multitude follow him and he heal them all and charge them that they should not make him know that it might be fulfil which be spoken by esaias the prophet say behold my servant whom have chosen my beloved in whom my soul be well pleased will put my spirit upon him and he shall shew judgment to the gentile he shall not strive nor cry neither shall any man hear his voice in the street bruise reed shall he not break and smoking flax shall he not quench till he send forth judgment unto victory and in his name shall the gentile trust then be brought unto him one possess with devil blind and dumb and he heal him insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw and all the people be amaze and say be not this the son of david but when the pharisee heard it they say this fellow doth not cast out devil but by beelzebub the prince of the devil and jesus knew their thought and say unto them every kingdom divide against itself be brought to desolation and every city or house divide against itself shall not stand and if satan cast out satan he be divide against himself how shall then his kingdom stand and if by beelzebub cast out devil by whom do your child cast them out therefore they shall be your judge but if cast out devil by the spirit of god then the kingdom of god be come unto you or else how can one enter into strong man house and spoil his good except he first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his house he that be not with me be against me and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad wherefore say unto you all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the holy ghost shall not be forgiven unto men and whosoever speaketh word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but whosoever speaketh against the holy ghost it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world neither in the world to come either make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree be know by his fruit generation of viper how can ye be evil speak good thing for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good thing and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil thing but say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment for by thy word thou shalt be justified and by thy word thou shalt be condemn then certain of the scribe and of the pharisee answer say master we would see sign from thee but he answer and say unto them an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after sign and there shall no sign be give to it but the sign of the prophet jonas for a jonas be three day and three night in the whale belly so shall the son of man be three day and three night in the heart of the earth the men of nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repent at the preach of jonas and behold great than jonas be here the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she come from the uttermost part of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold great than solomon be here when the unclean spirit be go out of man he walketh through dry place seek rest and findeth none then he saith will return into my house from whence come out and when he be come he findeth it empty swept and garnish then goeth he and taketh with himself seven other spirit more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man be bad than the first even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation while he yet talk to the people behold his mother and his brother stood without desire to speak with him then one say unto him behold thy mother and thy brother stand without desire to speak with thee but he answer and say unto him that told him who be my mother and who be my brother and he stretch forth his hand toward his disciple and say behold my mother and my brother for whosoever shall do the will of my father which be in heaven the same be my brother and sister and mother the same day go jesus out of the house and sat by the sea side and great multitude be gather together unto him so that he go into ship and sat and the whole multitude stood on the shore and he spake many thing unto them in parable say behold sower go forth to sow and when he sow some seed fell by the way side and the fowl come and devour them up some fell upon stony place where they have not much earth and forthwith they sprung up because they have no deepness of earth and when the sun be up they be scorch and because they have no root they wither away and some fell among thorn and the thorn sprung up and choked them but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit some an hundredfold some sixtyfold some thirtyfold who hath ear to hear let him hear and the disciple come and say unto him why speakest thou unto them in parable he answer and say unto them because it be give unto you to know the mystery of the kingdom of heaven but to them it be not give for whosoever hath to him shall be give and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be take away even that he hath therefore speak to them in parable because they see see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them be fulfil the prophecy of esaias which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and see ye shall see and shall not perceive for this people heart be waxed gross and their ear be dull of hearing and their eye they have close l at any time they should see with their eye and hear with their ear and should understand with their heart and should be convert and should heal them but bless be your eye for they see and your ear for they hear for verily say unto you that many prophet and righteous men have desire to see those thing which ye see and have not see them and to hear those thing which ye hear and have not heard them hear ye therefore the parable of the sower when any one heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which be sown in his heart this be he which receive seed by the way side but he that receive the seed into stony place the same be he that heareth the word and anon with joy receiveth it yet hath he not root in himself but dureth for while for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word by and by he be offend he also that receive seed among the thorn be he that heareth the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of rich choke the word and he becometh unfruitful but he that receive seed into the good ground be he that heareth the word and understandeth it which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth some an hundredfold some sixty some thirty another parable put he forth unto them say the kingdom of heaven be liken unto man which sow good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy come and sow tare among the wheat and go his way but when the blade be sprung up and brought forth fruit then appear the tare also so the servant of the householder come and say unto him sir didst not thou sow good seed in thy field from whence then hath it tare he say unto them an enemy hath do this the servant say unto him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up but he say nay l while ye gather up the tare ye root up also the wheat with them let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of harvest will say to the reaper gather ye together first the tare and bind them in bundle to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn another parable put he forth unto them say the kingdom of heaven be like to grain of mustard seed which man take and sow in his field which indeed be the least of all seed but when it be grown it be the great among herb and becometh tree so that the bird of the air come and lodge in the branch thereof another parable spake he unto them the kingdom of heaven be like unto leaven which woman take and hid in three measure of meal till the whole be leaven all these thing spake jesus unto the multitude in parable and without parable spake he not unto them that it might be fulfil which be spoken by the prophet say will open my mouth in parable will utter thing which have be kept secret from the foundation of the world then jesus sent the multitude away and go into the house and his disciple come unto him say declare unto u the parable of the tare of the field he answer and say unto them he that soweth the good seed be the son of man the field be the world the good seed be the child of the kingdom but the tare be the child of the wicked one the enemy that sow them be the devil the harvest be the end of the world and the reaper be the angel a therefore the tare be gather and burn in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world the son of man shall send forth his angel and they shall gather out of his kingdom all thing that offend and them which do iniquity and shall cast them into furnace of fire there shall be wail and gnash of teeth then shall the righteous shine forth a the sun in the kingdom of their father who hath ear to hear let him hear again the kingdom of heaven be like unto treasure hid in field the which when man hath found he hideth and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that field again the kingdom of heaven be like unto merchant man seek goodly pearl who when he have found one pearl of great price go and sell all that he have and bought it again the kingdom of heaven be like unto net that be cast into the sea and gather of every kind which when it be full they drew to shore and sat down and gather the good into vessel but cast the bad away so shall it be at the end of the world the angel shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just and shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be wail and gnash of teeth jesus saith unto them have ye understood all these thing they say unto him yea lord then say he unto them therefore every scribe which be instruct unto the kingdom of heaven be like unto man that be an householder which bringeth forth out of his treasure thing new and old and it come to pas that when jesus have finish these parable he depart thence and when he be come into his own country he taught them in their synagogue insomuch that they be astonish and say whence hath this man this wisdom and these mighty work be not this the carpenter son be not his mother call mary and his brother james and joses and simon and juda and his sister be they not all with u whence then hath this man all these thing and they be offend in him but jesus say unto them prophet be not without honour save in his own country and in his own house and he do not many mighty work there because of their unbelief at that time herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of jesus and say unto his servant this be john the baptist he be risen from the dead and therefore mighty work do shew forth themselves in him for herod have laid hold on john and bound him and put him in prison for herodias sake his brother philip wife for john say unto him it be not lawful for thee to have her and when he would have put him to death he fear the multitude because they count him a prophet but when herod birthday be kept the daughter of herodias dance before them and pleased herod whereupon he promise with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask and she be before instruct of her mother say give me here john baptist head in charger and the king be sorry nevertheless for the oath sake and them which sat with him at meat he command it to be give her and he sent and behead john in the prison and his head be brought in charger and give to the damsel and she brought it to her mother and his disciple come and take up the body and bury it and go and told jesus when jesus heard of it he depart thence by ship into desert place apart and when the people have heard thereof they follow him on foot out of the city and jesus go forth and saw great multitude and be move with compassion toward them and he heal their sick and when it be even his disciple come to him say this be desert place and the time be now past send the multitude away that they may go into the village and buy themselves victual but jesus say unto them they need not depart give ye them to eat and they say unto him we have here but five loaf and two fish he say bring them hither to me and he command the multitude to sit down on the grass and take the five loaf and the two fish and look up to heaven he bless and brake and give the loaf to his disciple and the disciple to the multitude and they do all eat and be fill and they take up of the fragment that remain twelve basket full and they that have eat be about five thousand men beside woman and child and straightway jesus constrain his disciple to get into ship and to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitude away and when he have sent the multitude away he go up into mountain apart to pray and when the even be come he be there alone but the ship be now in the midst of the sea toss with wave for the wind be contrary and in the fourth watch of the night jesus go unto them walk on the sea and when the disciple saw him walk on the sea they be troubled say it be spirit and they cry out for fear but straightway jesus spake unto them say be of good cheer it be be not afraid and peter answer him and say lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and he say come and when peter be come down out of the ship he walk on the water to go to jesus but when he saw the wind boisterous he be afraid and begin to sink he cry say lord save me and immediately jesus stretch forth his hand and caught him and say unto him thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt and when they be come into the ship the wind cease then they that be in the ship come and worship him say of truth thou art the son of god and when they be go over they come into the land of gennesaret and when the men of that place have knowledge of him they sent out into all that country round about and brought unto him all that be diseased and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment and a many a touch be make perfectly whole then come to jesus scribe and pharisee which be of jerusalem say why do thy disciple transgress the tradition of the elder for they wash not their hand when they eat bread but he answer and say unto them why do ye also transgress the commandment of god by your tradition for god command say honour thy father and mother and he that curseth father or mother let him die the death but ye say whosoever shall say to his father or his mother it be gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profit by me and honour not his father or his mother he shall be free thus have ye make the commandment of god of none effect by your tradition ye hypocrite well do esaias prophesy of you say this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoureth me with their lip but their heart be far from me but in vain they do worship me teach for doctrine the commandment of men and he call the multitude and say unto them hear and understand not that which goeth into the mouth defileth man but that which cometh out of the mouth this defileth man then come his disciple and say unto him knowest thou that the pharisee be offend after they heard this say but he answer and say every plant which my heavenly father hath not plant shall be root up let them alone they be blind leader of the blind and if the blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch then answer peter and say unto him declare unto u this parable and jesus say be ye also yet without understand do not ye yet understand that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly and be cast out into the draught but those thing which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile the man for out of the heart proceed evil thought murder adultery fornication theft false witness blasphemy these be the thing which defile man but to eat with unwashen hand defileth not man then jesus go thence and depart into the coast of tyre and sidon and behold woman of canaan come out of the same coast and cry unto him say have mercy on me lord thou son of david my daughter be grievously vexed with devil but he answer her not word and his disciple come and besought him say send her away for she crieth after u but he answer and say be not sent but unto the lose sheep of the house of israel then come she and worship him say lord help me but he answer and say it be not meet to take the child bread and to cast it to dog and she say truth lord yet the dog eat of the crumb which fall from their master table then jesus answer and say unto her woman great be thy faith be it unto thee even a thou wilt and her daughter be make whole from that very hour and jesus depart from thence and come nigh unto the sea of galilee and go up into mountain and sat down there and great multitude come unto him have with them those that be lame blind dumb maim and many others and cast them down at jesus foot and he heal them insomuch that the multitude wonder when they saw the dumb to speak the maim to be whole the lame to walk and the blind to see and they glorify the god of israel then jesus call his disciple unto him and say have compassion on the multitude because they continue with me now three day and have nothing to eat and will not send them away fast l they faint in the way and his disciple say unto him whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness a to fill so great multitude and jesus saith unto them how many loaf have ye and they say seven and few little fish and he command the multitude to sit down on the ground and he take the seven loaf and the fish and give thanks and brake them and give to his disciple and the disciple to the multitude and they do all eat and be fill and they take up of the broken meat that be left seven basket full and they that do eat be four thousand men beside woman and child and he sent away the multitude and take ship and come into the coast of magdala the pharisee also with the sadducee come and tempt desire him that he would shew them sign from heaven he answer and say unto them when it be even ye say it will be fair weather for the sky be red and in the morning it will be foul weather to day for the sky be red and lower ye hypocrite ye can discern the face of the sky but can ye not discern the sign of the time wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after sign and there shall no sign be give unto it but the sign of the prophet jonas and he left them and depart and when his disciple be come to the other side they have forgotten to take bread then jesus say unto them take heed and beware of the leaven of the pharisee and of the sadducee and they reason among themselves say it be because we have take no bread which when jesus perceive he say unto them ye of little faith why reason ye among yourselves because ye have brought no bread do ye not yet understand neither remember the five loaf of the five thousand and how many basket ye take up neither the seven loaf of the four thousand and how many basket ye take up how be it that ye do not understand that spake it not to you concern bread that ye should beware of the leaven of the pharisee and of the sadducee then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread but of the doctrine of the pharisee and of the sadducee when jesus come into the coast of caesarea philippi he ask his disciple say whom do men say that the son of man be and they say some say that thou art john the baptist some elia and others jeremias or one of the prophet he saith unto them but whom say ye that be and simon peter answer and say thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answer and say unto him bless art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not reveal it unto thee but my father which be in heaven and say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock will build my church and the gate of hell shall not prevail against it and will give unto thee the key of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loose in heaven then charge he his disciple that they should tell no man that he be jesus the christ from that time forth begin jesus to shew unto his disciple how that he must go unto jerusalem and suffer many thing of the elder and chief priest and scribe and be kill and be raise again the third day then peter take him and begin to rebuke him say be it far from thee lord this shall not be unto thee but he turn and say unto peter get thee behind me satan thou art an offence unto me for thou savourest not the thing that be of god but those that be of men then say jesus unto his disciple if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it for what be man profit if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall man give in exchange for his soul for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angel and then he shall reward every man accord to his work verily say unto you there be some stand here which shall not taste of death till they see the son of man come in his kingdom and after six day jesus taketh peter james and john his brother and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart and be transfigure before them and his face do shine a the sun and his raiment be white a the light and behold there appear unto them moses and elia talk with him then answer peter and say unto jesus lord it be good for u to be here if thou wilt let u make here three tabernacle one for thee and one for moses and one for elia while he yet spake behold bright cloud overshadow them and behold voice out of the cloud which say this be my beloved son in whom be well pleased hear ye him and when the disciple heard it they fell on their face and be sore afraid and jesus come and touch them and say arise and be not afraid and when they have lift up their eye they saw no man save jesus only and a they come down from the mountain jesus charge them say tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead and his disciple ask him say why then say the scribe that elia must first come and jesus answer and say unto them elia truly shall first come and restore all thing but say unto you that elia be come already and they knew him not but have do unto him whatsoever they list likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them then the disciple understood that he spake unto them of john the baptist and when they be come to the multitude there come to him certain man kneel down to him and say lord have mercy on my son for he be lunatick and sore vexed for ofttimes he falleth into the fire and oft into the water and brought him to thy disciple and they could not cure him then jesus answer and say faithless and perverse generation how long shall be with you how long shall suffer you bring him hither to me and jesus rebuke the devil and he depart out of him and the child be cure from that very hour then come the disciple to jesus apart and say why could not we cast him out and jesus say unto them because of your unbelief for verily say unto you if ye have faith a grain of mustard seed ye shall say unto this mountain remove hence to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fast and while they abode in galilee jesus say unto them the son of man shall be betrayed into the hand of men and they shall kill him and the third day he shall be raise again and they be exceed sorry and when they be come to capernaum they that receive tribute money come to peter and say doth not your master pay tribute he saith yes and when he be come into the house jesus prevent him say what thinkest thou simon of whom do the king of the earth take custom or tribute of their own child or of stranger peter saith unto him of stranger jesus saith unto him then be the child free notwithstanding l we should offend them go thou to the sea and cast an hook and take up the fish that first cometh up and when thou hast open his mouth thou shalt find piece of money that take and give unto them for me and thee at the same time come the disciple unto jesus say who be the great in the kingdom of heaven and jesus call little child unto him and set him in the midst of them and say verily say unto you except ye be convert and become a little child ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven whosoever therefore shall humble himself a this little child the same be great in the kingdom of heaven and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me but whoso shall offend one of these little one which believe in me it be well for him that millstone be hang about his neck and that he be drown in the depth of the sea woe unto the world because of offence for it must need be that offence come but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee cut them off and cast them from thee it be well for thee to enter into life halt or maim rather than have two hand or two foot to be cast into everlasting fire and if thine eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee it be well for thee to enter into life with one eye rather than have two eye to be cast into hell fire take heed that ye despise not one of these little one for say unto you that in heaven their angel do always behold the face of my father which be in heaven for the son of man be come to save that which be lose how think ye if man have an hundred sheep and one of them be go astray doth he not leave the ninety and nine and goeth into the mountain and seeketh that which be go astray and if so be that he find it verily say unto you he rejoiceth more of that sheep than of the ninety and nine which go not astray even so it be not the will of your father which be in heaven that one of these little one should perish moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone if he shall hear thee thou hast gain thy brother but if he will not hear thee then take with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three witness every word may be establish and if he shall neglect to hear them tell it unto the church but if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee a an heathen man and publican verily say unto you whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loose in heaven again say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth a touch any thing that they shall ask it shall be do for them of my father which be in heaven for where two or three be gather together in my name there be in the midst of them then come peter to him and say lord how oft shall my brother sin against me and forgive him till seven time jesus saith unto him say not unto thee until seven time but until seventy time seven therefore be the kingdom of heaven liken unto certain king which would take account of his servant and when he have begin to reckon one be brought unto him which owe him ten thousand talent but forasmuch a he have not to pay his lord command him to be sell and his wife and child and all that he have and payment to be make the servant therefore fell down and worship him say lord have patience with me and will pay thee all then the lord of that servant be move with compassion and loose him and forgave him the debt but the same servant go out and found one of his fellowservants which owe him an hundred penny and he laid hand on him and take him by the throat say pay me that thou owest and his fellowservant fell down at his foot and besought him say have patience with me and will pay thee all and he would not but go and cast him into prison till he should pay the debt so when his fellowservants saw what be do they be very sorry and come and told unto their lord all that be do then his lord after that he have call him say unto him thou wicked servant forgave thee all that debt because thou desiredst me shouldest not thou also have have compassion on thy fellowservant even a have pity on thee and his lord be wroth and deliver him to the tormentor till he should pay all that be due unto him so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if ye from your heart forgive not every one his brother their trespass and it come to pas that when jesus have finish these saying he depart from galilee and come into the coast of judaea beyond jordan and great multitude follow him and he heal them there the pharisee also come unto him tempt him and say unto him be it lawful for man to put away his wife for every cause and he answer and say unto them have ye not read that he which make them at the begin make them male and female and say for this cause shall man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore they be no more twain but one flesh what therefore god hath join together let not man put asunder they say unto him why do moses then command to give write of divorcement and to put her away he saith unto them moses because of the hardness of your heart suffer you to put away your wife but from the begin it be not so and say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whoso marrieth her which be put away doth commit adultery his disciple say unto him if the case of the man be so with his wife it be not good to marry but he say unto them all men cannot receive this say save they to whom it be give for there be some eunuch which be so born from their mother womb and there be some eunuch which be make eunuch of men and there be eunuch which have make themselves eunuch for the kingdom of heaven sake he that be able to receive it let him receive it then be there brought unto him little child that he should put his hand on them and pray and the disciple rebuke them but jesus say suffer little child and forbid them not to come unto me for of such be the kingdom of heaven and he laid his hand on them and depart thence and behold one come and say unto him good master what good thing shall do that may have eternal life and he say unto him why callest thou me good there be none good but one that be god but if thou wilt enter into life keep the commandment he saith unto him which jesus say thou shalt do no murder thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness honour thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbour a thyself the young man saith unto him all these thing have kept from my youth up what lack yet jesus say unto him if thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me but when the young man heard that say he go away sorrowful for he have great possession then say jesus unto his disciple verily say unto you that rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven and again say unto you it be easy for camel to go through the eye of needle than for rich man to enter into the kingdom of god when his disciple heard it they be exceedingly amaze say who then can be save but jesus beheld them and say unto them with men this be impossible but with god all thing be possible then answer peter and say unto him behold we have forsaken all and follow thee what shall we have therefore and jesus say unto them verily say unto you that ye which have follow me in the regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory ye also shall sit upon twelve throne judging the twelve tribe of israel and every one that hath forsaken house or brother or sister or father or mother or wife or child or land for my name sake shall receive an hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting life but many that be first shall be last and the last shall be first for the kingdom of heaven be like unto man that be an householder which go out early in the morning to hire labourer into his vineyard and when he have agree with the labourer for penny day he sent them into his vineyard and he go out about the third hour and saw others stand idle in the marketplace and say unto them go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever be right will give you and they go their way again he go out about the sixth and ninth hour and do likewise and about the eleventh hour he go out and found others stand idle and saith unto them why stand ye here all the day idle they say unto him because no man hath hire u he saith unto them go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever be right that shall ye receive so when even be come the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward call the labourer and give them their hire begin from the last unto the first and when they come that be hire about the eleventh hour they receive every man penny but when the first come they suppose that they should have receive more and they likewise receive every man penny and when they have receive it they murmur against the goodman of the house say these last have wrought but one hour and thou hast make them equal unto u which have borne the burden and heat of the day but he answer one of them and say friend do thee no wrong didst not thou agree with me for penny take that thine be and go thy way will give unto this last even a unto thee be it not lawful for me to do what will with mine own be thine eye evil because be good so the last shall be first and the first last for many be call but few chosen and jesus go up to jerusalem take the twelve disciple apart in the way and say unto them behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priest and unto the scribe and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the gentile to mock and to scourge and to crucify him and the third day he shall rise again then come to him the mother of zebedees child with her son worship him and desire certain thing of him and he say unto her what wilt thou she saith unto him grant that these my two son may sit the one on thy right hand and the other on the left in thy kingdom but jesus answer and say ye know not what ye ask be ye able to drink of the cup that shall drink of and to be baptize with the baptism that be baptize with they say unto him we be able and he saith unto them ye shall drink indeed of my cup and be baptize with the baptism that be baptize with but to sit on my right hand and on my left be not mine to give but it shall be give to them for whom it be prepared of my father and when the ten heard it they be move with indignation against the two brother but jesus call them unto him and say ye know that the prince of the gentile exercise dominion over them and they that be great exercise authority upon them but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister and whosoever will be chief among you let him be your servant even a the son of man come not to be minister unto but to minister and to give his life ransom for many and a they depart from jericho great multitude follow him and behold two blind men sit by the way side when they heard that jesus pass by cry out say have mercy on u lord thou son of david and the multitude rebuke them because they should hold their peace but they cry the more say have mercy on u lord thou son of david and jesus stood still and call them and say what will ye that shall do unto you they say unto him lord that our eye may be open so jesus have compassion on them and touch their eye and immediately their eye receive sight and they follow him and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem and be come to bethphage unto the mount of olive then sent jesus two disciple say unto them go into the village over against you and straightway ye shall find an as tie and colt with her loose them and bring them unto me and if any man say ought unto you ye shall say the lord hath need of them and straightway he will send them all this be do that it might be fulfil which be spoken by the prophet say tell ye the daughter of sion behold thy king cometh unto thee meek and sit upon an as and colt the foal of an as and the disciple go and do a jesus command them and brought the as and the colt and put on them their clothes and they set him thereon and very great multitude spread their garment in the way others cut down branch from the tree and straw them in the way and the multitude that go before and that follow cry say hosanna to the son of david bless be he that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the high and when he be come into jerusalem all the city be move say who be this and the multitude say this be jesus the prophet of nazareth of galilee and jesus go into the temple of god and cast out all them that sell and bought in the temple and overthrew the table of the moneychangers and the seat of them that sell dove and say unto them it be write my house shall be call the house of prayer but ye have make it den of thief and the blind and the lame come to him in the temple and he heal them and when the chief priest and scribe saw the wonderful thing that he do and the child cry in the temple and say hosanna to the son of david they be sore displeased and say unto him hearest thou what these say and jesus saith unto them yea have ye never read out of the mouth of babe and suckling thou hast perfect praise and he left them and go out of the city into bethany and he lodge there now in the morning a he return into the city he hunger and when he saw fig tree in the way he come to it and found nothing thereon but leaf only and say unto it let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever and presently the fig tree wither away and when the disciple saw it they marvel say how soon be the fig tree wither away jesus answer and say unto them verily say unto you if ye have faith and doubt not ye shall not only do this which be do to the fig tree but also if ye shall say unto this mountain be thou remove and be thou cast into the sea it shall be do and all thing whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believe ye shall receive and when he be come into the temple the chief priest and the elder of the people come unto him a he be teach and say by what authority doest thou these thing and who give thee this authority and jesus answer and say unto them also will ask you one thing which if ye tell me in like wise will tell you by what authority do these thing the baptism of john whence be it from heaven or of men and they reason with themselves say if we shall say from heaven he will say unto u why do ye not then believe him but if we shall say of men we fear the people for all hold john a prophet and they answer jesus and say we cannot tell and he say unto them neither tell you by what authority do these thing but what think ye certain man have two son and he come to the first and say son go work to day in my vineyard he answer and say will not but afterward he repent and go and he come to the second and say likewise and he answer and say go sir and go not whether of them twain do the will of his father they say unto him the first jesus saith unto them verily say unto you that the publican and the harlot go into the kingdom of god before you for john come unto you in the way of righteousness and ye believe him not but the publican and the harlot believe him and ye when ye have see it repent not afterward that ye might believe him hear another parable there be certain householder which plant vineyard and hedge it round about and digged winepress in it and built tower and let it out to husbandman and go into far country and when the time of the fruit drew near he sent his servant to the husbandman that they might receive the fruit of it and the husbandman take his servant and beat one and kill another and stone another again he sent other servant more than the first and they do unto them likewise but last of all he sent unto them his son say they will reverence my son but when the husbandman saw the son they say among themselves this be the heir come let u kill him and let u seize on his inheritance and they caught him and cast him out of the vineyard and slew him when the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh what will he do unto those husbandman they say unto him he will miserably destroy those wicked men and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandman which shall render him the fruit in their season jesus saith unto them do ye never read in the scripture the stone which the builder reject the same be become the head of the corner this be the lord do and it be marvellous in our eye therefore say unto you the kingdom of god shall be take from you and give to nation bring forth the fruit thereof and whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder and when the chief priest and pharisee have heard his parable they perceive that he spake of them but when they sought to lay hand on him they fear the multitude because they take him for prophet and jesus answer and spake unto them again by parable and say the kingdom of heaven be like unto certain king which make marriage for his son and sent forth his servant to call them that be bidden to the wedding and they would not come again he sent forth other servant say tell them which be bidden behold have prepared my dinner my ox and my fatlings be kill and all thing be ready come unto the marriage but they make light of it and go their way one to his farm another to his merchandise and the remnant take his servant and entreat them spitefully and slew them but when the king heard thereof he be wroth and he sent forth his army and destroyed those murderer and burn up their city then saith he to his servant the wedding be ready but they which be bidden be not worthy go ye therefore into the highway and a many a ye shall find bid to the marriage so those servant go out into the highway and gather together all a many a they found both bad and good and the wedding be furnish with guest and when the king come in to see the guest he saw there man which have not on wedding garment and he saith unto him friend how camest thou in hither not have wedding garment and he be speechless then say the king to the servant bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast him into outer darkness there shall be weep and gnash of teeth for many be call but few be chosen then go the pharisee and take counsel how they might entangle him in his talk and they sent out unto him their disciple with the herodians say master we know that thou art true and teachest the way of god in truth neither carest thou for any man for thou regardest not the person of men tell u therefore what thinkest thou be it lawful to give tribute unto caesar or not but jesus perceive their wickedness and say why tempt ye me ye hypocrite shew me the tribute money and they brought unto him penny and he saith unto them whose be this image and superscription they say unto him caesar then saith he unto them render therefore unto caesar the thing which be caesar and unto god the thing that be god when they have heard these word they marvel and left him and go their way the same day come to him the sadducee which say that there be no resurrection and ask him say master moses say if man die have no child his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed unto his brother now there be with u seven brother and the first when he have married wife decease and have no issue left his wife unto his brother likewise the second also and the third unto the seventh and last of all the woman die also therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven for they all have her jesus answer and say unto them ye do err not know the scripture nor the power of god for in the resurrection they neither marry nor be give in marriage but be a the angel of god in heaven but a touch the resurrection of the dead have ye not read that which be spoken unto you by god say be the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob god be not the god of the dead but of the living and when the multitude heard this they be astonish at his doctrine but when the pharisee have heard that he have put the sadducee to silence they be gather together then one of them which be lawyer ask him question tempt him and say master which be the great commandment in the law jesus say unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this be the first and great commandment and the second be like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbour a thyself on these two commandment hang all the law and the prophet while the pharisee be gather together jesus ask them say what think ye of christ whose son be he they say unto him the son of david he saith unto them how then doth david in spirit call him lord say the lord say unto my lord sit thou on my right hand till make thine enemy thy footstool if david then call him lord how be he his son and no man be able to answer him word neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more question then spake jesus to the multitude and to his disciple say the scribe and the pharisee sit in moses seat all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe that observe and do but do not ye after their work for they say and do not for they bind heavy burden and grievous to be borne and lay them on men shoulder but they themselves will not move them with one of their finger but all their work they do for to be see of men they make broad their phylactery and enlarge the border of their garment and love the uppermost room at feast and the chief seat in the synagogue and greeting in the market and to be call of men rabbi rabbi but be not ye call rabbi for one be your master even christ and all ye be brother and call no man your father upon the earth for one be your father which be in heaven neither be ye call master for one be your master even christ but he that be great among you shall be your servant and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abase and he that shall humble himself shall be exalt but woe unto you scribe and pharisee hypocrite for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that be enter to go in woe unto you scribe and pharisee hypocrite for ye devour widow house and for pretence make long prayer therefore ye shall receive the great damnation woe unto you scribe and pharisee hypocrite for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte and when he be make ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves woe unto you ye blind guide which say whosoever shall swear by the temple it be nothing but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple he be debtor ye fool and blind for whether be great the gold or the temple that sanctifieth the gold and whosoever shall swear by the altar it be nothing but whosoever sweareth by the gift that be upon it he be guilty ye fool and blind for whether be great the gift or the altar that sanctifieth the gift whoso therefore shall swear by the altar sweareth by it and by all thing thereon and whoso shall swear by the temple sweareth by it and by him that dwelleth therein and he that shall swear by heaven sweareth by the throne of god and by him that sitteth thereon woe unto you scribe and pharisee hypocrite for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin and have omit the weightier matter of the law judgment mercy and faith these ought ye to have do and not to leave the other undone ye blind guide which strain at gnat and swallow camel woe unto you scribe and pharisee hypocrite for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they be full of extortion and excess thou blind pharisee cleanse first that which be within the cup and platter that the outside of them may be clean also woe unto you scribe and pharisee hypocrite for ye be like unto white sepulchre which indeed appear beautiful outward but be within full of dead men bone and of all uncleanness even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within ye be full of hypocrisy and iniquity woe unto you scribe and pharisee hypocrite because ye build the tomb of the prophet and garnish the sepulchre of the righteous and say if we have be in the day of our father we would not have be partaker with them in the blood of the prophet wherefore ye be witness unto yourselves that ye be the child of them which kill the prophet fill ye up then the measure of your father ye serpent ye generation of viper how can ye escape the damnation of hell wherefore behold send unto you prophet and wise men and scribe and some of them ye shall kill and crucify and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogue and persecute them from city to city that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth from the blood of righteous abel unto the blood of zacharias son of barachias whom ye slew between the temple and the altar verily say unto you all these thing shall come upon this generation jerusalem jerusalem thou that killest the prophet and stonest them which be sent unto thee how often would have gather thy child together even a hen gathereth her chicken under her wing and ye would not behold your house be left unto you desolate for say unto you ye shall not see me henceforth till ye shall say bless be he that cometh in the name of the lord and jesus go out and depart from the temple and his disciple come to him for to shew him the building of the temple and jesus say unto them see ye not all these thing verily say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and a he sat upon the mount of olive the disciple come unto him privately say tell u when shall these thing be and what shall be the sign of thy come and of the end of the world and jesus answer and say unto them take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name say be christ and shall deceive many and ye shall hear of war and rumour of war see that ye be not troubled for all these thing must come to pas but the end be not yet for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famine and pestilence and earthquake in diver place all these be the begin of sorrow then shall they deliver you up to be afflict and shall kill you and ye shall be hat of all nation for my name sake and then shall many be offend and shall betray one another and shall hate one another and many false prophet shall rise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be save and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preach in all the world for witness unto all nation and then shall the end come when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by daniel the prophet stand in the holy place whoso readeth let him understand then let them which be in judaea flee into the mountain let him which be on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house neither let him which be in the field return back to take his clothes and woe unto them that be with child and to them that give suck in those day but pray ye that your flight be not in the winter neither on the sabbath day for then shall be great tribulation such a be not since the begin of the world to this time no nor ever shall be and except those day should be shorten there should no flesh be save but for the elect sake those day shall be shorten then if any man shall say unto you lo here be christ or there believe it not for there shall arise false christ and false prophet and shall shew great sign and wonder insomuch that if it be possible they shall deceive the very elect behold have told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he be in the desert go not forth behold he be in the secret chamber believe it not for a the lightning cometh out of the east and shineth even unto the west so shall also the come of the son of man be for wheresoever the carcase be there will the eagle be gather together immediately after the tribulation of those day shall the sun be darken and the moon shall not give her light and the star shall fall from heaven and the power of the heaven shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribe of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man come in the cloud of heaven with power and great glory and he shall send his angel with great sound of trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the four wind from one end of heaven to the other now learn parable of the fig tree when his branch be yet tender and putteth forth leaf ye know that summer be nigh so likewise ye when ye shall see all these thing know that it be near even at the door verily say unto you this generation shall not pas till all these thing be fulfil heaven and earth shall pas away but my word shall not pas away but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angel of heaven but my father only but a the day of noe be so shall also the come of the son of man be for a in the day that be before the flood they be eat and drinking marry and give in marriage until the day that noe enter into the ark and knew not until the flood come and take them all away so shall also the come of the son of man be then shall two be in the field the one shall be take and the other left two woman shall be grind at the mill the one shall be take and the other left watch therefore for ye know not what hour your lord doth come but know this that if the goodman of the house have know in what watch the thief would come he would have watch and would not have suffer his house to be broken up therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour a ye think not the son of man cometh who then be faithful and wise servant whom his lord hath make ruler over his household to give them meat in due season bless be that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so do verily say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his good but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart my lord delayeth his come and shall

holy angel with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gather all nation and he shall separate them one from another a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goat and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goat on the left then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye bless of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the

always with you but me ye have not always for in that she hath pour this ointment on my body she do it for my burial verily say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preach in the whole world there shall also this that this woman hath do be told for memorial of her then one of the twelve call juda iscariot go unto the chief priest and say unto them what will ye give me and will deliver him

and give it to them say drink ye all of it for this be my blood of the new testament which be shed for many for the remission of sin but say unto you will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when drink it new with you in my father kingdom and when they have sung an hymn they go out into the mount of olive then saith jesus unto them all ye shall be offend because of me this night for it be write will smite the shepherd and the sheep of the flock shall be scatter abroad but after be risen again will go before you into galilee peter answer and say unto him though all men shall be offend because of thee yet will never be offend jesus say unto him verily say unto thee that this night before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice peter say unto him though should die with thee yet will not deny thee likewise also say all the disciple then cometh jesus with them unto place call gethsemane and saith unto the disciple sit ye here while go and pray yonder and he take with him peter and the two son of zebedee and begin to be sorrowful and very heavy then saith he unto them my soul be exceed sorrowful even unto death tarry ye here and watch with me and he go little farther and fell on his face and prayed say my father if it be possible let this cup pas from me nevertheless not a will but a thou wilt and he cometh unto the disciple and findeth them asleep and

prayed say my father if this cup may not pas away from me except drink it thy will be do and he come and found them asleep again for their eye be heavy and he left them and go away again and prayed the third time say the same word then cometh he to his disciple and saith unto them sleep on now and take your rest behold the hour be at hand and the son of man be betrayed into the hand of sinner rise let u be go behold he be at hand that doth betray me and while he yet spake lo juda one of the twelve come and with him great multitude with sword and stave from the chief priest and elder of the people now he that betrayed him give them sign say whomsoever shall kiss that same be he hold him fast and forthwith he come to jesus and say hail master and kiss him and jesus say unto him friend wherefore art thou come then come they and laid hand on jesus and take him and behold one of them which be with jesus stretch out his hand and drew his sword and struck servant of the high priest and smote off his ear then say jesus unto him put up again thy sword into his place for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword thinkest thou that cannot now pray to my father and he shall presently give me more than twelve legion of angel but how then shall the scripture be fulfil that thus it must be in that same hour say jesus to the multitude be ye come out a against thief with sword and stave for to take me sat daily with you teach in the temple and ye laid no hold on me but all this be do that the scripture of the prophet might be fulfil then all the disciple forsook him and flee and they that have laid hold on jesus lead him away to caiaphas the high priest where the scribe and the elder be assemble but peter follow him afar off unto the high priest palace and go in and sat with the servant to see the end now the chief priest and elder and all the council sought false witness against jesus to put him to death but found none yea though many false witness come yet found they none at the last come two false witness and say this fellow say be able to destroy the temple of god and to build it in three day and the high priest arose and say unto him answerest thou nothing what be it which these witness against thee but jesus held his peace and the high priest answer and say unto him adjure thee by the living god that thou tell u whether thou be the christ the son of god jesus saith unto him thou hast say nevertheless say unto you hereafter shall ye see the son of man sit on the right hand of power and come in the cloud of heaven then the high priest rent his clothes say he hath spoken blasphemy what far need have we of witness behold now ye have heard his blasphemy what think ye they answer and say he be guilty of death then do they spit in his face and buffet him and others smote him with the palm of their hand say prophesy unto u thou christ who be he that smote thee now peter sat without in the palace and damsel come unto him say thou also wast with jesus of galilee but he deny before them all say know not what thou sayest and when he be go out into the porch another maid saw him and say unto them that be there this fellow be also with jesus of nazareth and again he deny with an oath do not know the man and after while come unto him they that stood by and say to peter surely thou also art one of them for thy speech bewrayeth thee then begin he to curse and to swear say know not the man and immediately the cock crew and peter remember the word of jesus which say unto him before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice and he go out and wept bitterly when the morning be come all the chief priest and elder of the people take counsel against jesus to put him to death and when they have bound him they lead him away and deliver him to pontius pilate the governor then juda which have betrayed him when he saw that he be condemn repent himself and brought again the thirty piece of silver to the chief priest and elder say have sin in that have betrayed the innocent blood and they say what be that to u see thou to that and he cast down the piece of silver in the temple and depart and go and hang himself and the chief priest take the silver piece and say it be not lawful for to put them into the treasury because it be the price of blood and they take counsel and bought with them the potter field to bury stranger in wherefore that field be call the field of blood unto this day then be fulfil that which be spoken by jeremy the prophet say and they take the thirty piece of silver the price of him that be value whom they of the child of israel do value and give them for the potter field a the lord appoint me and jesus stood before the governor and the governor ask him say art thou the king of the jew and jesus say unto him thou sayest and when he be accuse of the chief priest and elder he answer nothing then say pilate unto him hearest thou not how many thing they witness against thee and he answer him to never word insomuch that the governor marvel greatly now at that feast the governor be wont to release unto the people prisoner whom they would and they have then notable prisoner call barabbas therefore when they be gather together pilate say unto them whom will ye that release unto you barabbas or jesus which be call christ for he knew that for envy they have deliver him when he be set down on the judgment seat his wife sent unto him say have thou nothing to do with that just man for have suffer many thing this day in dream because of him but the chief priest and elder persuade the multitude that they should ask barabbas and destroy jesus the governor answer and say unto them whether of the twain will ye that release unto you they say barabbas pilate saith unto them what shall do then with jesus which be call christ they all say unto him let him be crucify and the governor say why what evil hath he do but they cry out the more say let him be crucify when pilate saw that he could prevail nothing but that rather tumult be make he take water and wash his hand before the multitude say be innocent of the blood of this just person see ye to it then answer all the people and say his blood be on u and on our child then release he barabbas unto them and when he have scourge jesus he deliver him to be crucify then the soldier of the governor take jesus into the common hall and gather unto him the whole band of soldier and they strip him and put on him scarlet robe and when they have plat crown of thorn they put it upon his head and reed in his right hand and they bow the knee before him and mocked him say hail king of the jew and they spit upon him and take the reed and smote him on the head and after that they have mocked him they take the robe off from him and put his own raiment on him and lead him away to crucify him and a they come out they found man of cyrene simon by name him they compel to bear his cross and when they be come unto place call golgotha that be to say place of skull they give him vinegar to drink mingle with gall and when he have taste thereof he would not drink and they crucify him and part his garment cast lot that it might be fulfil which be spoken by the prophet they part my garment among them and upon my vesture do they cast lot and sit down they watch him there and set up over his head his accusation write this be jesus the king of the jew then be there two thief crucify with him one on the right hand and another on the left and they that pass by revile him wag their head and say thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three day save thyself if thou be the son of god come down from the cross likewise also the chief priest mock him with the scribe and elder say he save others himself he cannot save if he be the king of israel let him now come down from the cross and we will believe him he trust in god let him deliver him now if he will have him for he say be the son of god the thief also which be crucify with him cast the same in his teeth now from the sixth hour there be darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour and about the ninth hour jesus cry with loud voice say eli eli lama sabachthani that be to say my god my god why hast thou forsaken me some of them that stood there when they heard that say this man calleth for elia and straightway one of them ran and take spunge and fill it with vinegar and put it on reed and give him to drink the rest say let be let u see whether elia will come to save him jesus when he have cry again with loud voice yield up the ghost and behold the veil of the temple be rent in twain from the top to the bottom and the earth do quake and the rock rent and the graf be open and many body of the saint which slept arose and come out of the graf after his resurrection and go into the holy city and appear unto many now when the centurion and they that be with him watch jesus saw the earthquake and those thing that be do they fear greatly say truly this be the son of god and many woman be there beholding afar off which follow jesus from galilee minister unto him among which be mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and joses and the mother of zebedees child when the even be come there come rich man of arimathaea name joseph who also himself be jesus disciple he go to pilate and beg the body of jesus then pilate command the

sepulchre and depart and there be mary magdalene and the other mary sit over against the sepulchre now the next day that follow the day of the preparation the chief priest and pharisee come together unto pilate say sir we remember that that deceiver say while he be yet alive after three day will rise again command therefore that the sepulchre be make sure until the third day l his disciple come by night and steal him away and say unto the people he be risen from the dead so the last error shall be bad than the first pilate say unto them ye have watch go your way make it a sure a ye can so they go and make the sepulchre sure seal the stone and set watch in the end of the sabbath a it begin to dawn toward the first day of the week come mary magdalene and the other mary to see the

for he be risen a he say come see the place where the lord lay and go quickly and tell his disciple that he be risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye see him lo have told you and they depart quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy and do run to bring his disciple word and a they go to tell his disciple behold jesus met them say all hail and they come and held him by the foot and worship him then say jesus unto them be not afraid go tell my brother that they go into galilee and there shall they see me now when they be go behold some of the watch come into the city and shew unto the chief priest all the thing that be do and when they be assemble with the elder and have take counsel they give large money unto the soldier say say ye his disciple come by night and stole him away while we slept and if this come to the governor ear we will persuade him and secure you so they take the money and do a they be taught and this say be commonly report among the jew until this day then the eleven disciple go away into galilee into mountain where jesus have appoint them and when they saw him they worship him but some doubt and jesus come and spake unto them say all power be give unto me in heaven and in earth go ye therefore and teach all nation baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost teach them to observe all thing whatsoever have command you and lo be with you alway even unto the end of the world amen book mark the begin of the gospel of jesus christ the son of god a it be write in the prophet behold send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee the voice of one cry in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his path straight john do baptize in the wilderness and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sin and there go out unto him all the land of judaea and they of jerusalem and be all baptize of him in the river of jordan confess their sin and john be clothed with camel hair and with girdle of skin about his loin and he do eat locust and wild honey and preach say there cometh one mightier than after me the latchet of whose shoe be not worthy to stoop down and unloose indeed have baptize you with water but he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and it come to pas in those day that jesus come from nazareth of galilee and be baptize of john in jordan and straightway come up out of the water he saw the heaven open and the spirit like dove descend upon him and there come voice from heaven say thou art my beloved son in whom be well pleased and immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness and he be there in the wilderness forty day tempt of satan and be with the wild beast and the angel minister unto him now after that john be put in prison jesus come into galilee preach the gospel of the kingdom of god and say the time be fulfil and the kingdom of god be at hand repent ye and believe the gospel now a he walk by the sea of galilee he saw simon and andrew his brother cast net into the sea for they be fisher and jesus say unto them come ye after me and will make you to become fisher of men and straightway they forsook their net and follow him and when he have go little farther thence he saw james the son of zebedee and john his brother who also be in the ship mend their net and straightway he call them and they left their father zebedee in the ship with the hire servant and go after him and they go into capernaum and straightway on the sabbath day he enter into the synagogue and taught and they be astonish at his doctrine for he taught them a one that have authority and not a the scribe and there be in their synagogue man with an unclean spirit and he cry out say let u alone what have we to do with thee thou jesus of nazareth art thou come to destroy u know thee who thou art the holy one of god and jesus rebuke him say hold thy peace and come out of him and when the unclean spirit have torn him and cry with loud voice he come out of him and they be all amaze insomuch that they question among themselves say what thing be this what new doctrine be this for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirit and they do obey him and immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about galilee and forthwith when they be come out of the synagogue they enter into the house of simon and andrew with james and john but simon wife mother lay sick of fever and anon they tell him of her and he come and take her by the hand and lift her up and immediately the fever left her and she minister unto them and at even when the sun do set they brought unto him all that be diseased and them that be possess with devil and all the city be gather together at the door and he heal many that be sick of diver disease and cast out many devil and suffer not the devil to speak because they knew him and in the morning rise up great while before day he go out and depart into solitary place and there prayed and simon and they that be with him follow after him and when they have found him they say unto him all men seek for thee and he say unto them let u go into the next town that may preach there also for therefore come forth and he preach in their synagogue throughout all galilee and cast out devil and there come leper to him beseeching him and kneel down to him and say unto him if thou wilt thou canst make me clean and jesus move with compassion put forth his hand and touch him and saith unto him will be thou clean and a soon a he have spoken immediately the leprosy depart from him and he be cleanse and he straitly charge him and forthwith sent him away and saith unto him see thou say nothing to any man but go thy way shew thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleanse those thing which moses command for testimony unto them but he go out and begin to publish it much and to blaze abroad the matter insomuch that jesus could no more openly enter into the city but be without in desert place and they come to him from every quarter and again he enter into capernaum after some day and it be noise that he be in the house and straightway many be gather together insomuch that there be no room to receive them no not so much a about the door and he preach the word unto them and they come unto him bring one sick of the palsy which be borne of four and when they could not come nigh unto him for the press they uncovered the roof where he be and when they have broken it up they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay when jesus saw their faith he say unto the sick of the palsy son thy sin be forgiven thee but there be certain of the scribe sit there and reason in their heart why doth this man thus speak blasphemy who can forgive sin but god only and immediately when jesus perceive in his spirit that they so reason within themselves he say unto them why reason ye these thing in your heart whether be it easy to say to the sick of the palsy thy sin be forgiven thee or to say arise and take up thy bed and walk but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sin he saith to the sick of the palsy say unto thee arise and take up thy bed and go thy way into thine house and immediately he arose take up the bed and go forth before them all insomuch that they be all amaze and glorify god say we never saw it on this fashion and he go forth again by the sea side and all the multitude resort unto him and he taught them and a he pass by he saw levi the son of alphaeus sit at the receipt of custom and say unto him follow me and he arose and follow him and it come to pas that a jesus sat at meat in his house many publican and sinner sat also together with jesus and his disciple for there be many and they follow him and when the scribe and pharisee saw him eat with publican and sinner they say unto his disciple how be it that he eateth and drinketh with publican and sinner when jesus heard it he saith unto them they that be whole have no need of the physician but they that be sick come not to call the righteous but sinner to repentance and the disciple of john and of the pharisee use to fast and they come and say unto him why do the disciple of john and of the pharisee fast but thy disciple fast not and jesus say unto them can the child of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom be with them a long a they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast but the day will come when the bridegroom shall be take away from them and then shall they fast in those day no man also seweth piece of new cloth on an old garment else the new piece that fill it up taketh away from the old and the rent be make bad and no man putteth new wine into old bottle else the new wine doth burst the bottle and the wine be spill and the bottle will be mar but new wine must be put into new bottle and it come to pas that he go through the corn field on the sabbath day and his disciple begin a they go to pluck the ear of corn and the pharisee say unto him behold why do they on the sabbath day that which be not lawful and he say unto them have ye never read what david do when he have need and be an hungred he and they that be with him how he go into the house of god in the day of abiathar the high priest and do eat the shewbread which be not lawful to eat but for the priest and give also to them which be with him and he say unto them the sabbath be make for man and not man for the sabbath therefore the son of man be lord also of the sabbath and he enter again into the synagogue and there be man there which have wither hand and they watch him whether he would heal him on the sabbath day that they might accuse him and he saith unto the man which have the wither hand stand forth and he saith unto them be it lawful to do good on the sabbath day or to do evil to save life or to kill but they held their peace and when he have look round about on them with anger be grieve for the hardness of their heart he saith unto the man stretch forth thine hand and he stretch it out and his hand be restore whole a the other and the pharisee go forth and straightway take counsel with the herodians against him how they might destroy him but jesus withdrew himself with his disciple to the sea and great multitude from galilee follow him and from judaea and from jerusalem and from idumaea and from beyond jordan and they about tyre and sidon great multitude when they have heard what great thing he do come unto him and he spake to his disciple that small ship should wait on him because of the multitude l they should throng him for he have heal many insomuch that they press upon him for to touch him a many a have plague and unclean spirit when they saw him fell down before him and cry say thou art the son of god and he straitly charge them that they should not make him know and he goeth up into mountain and calleth unto him whom he would and they come unto him and he ordain twelve that they should be with him and that he might send them forth to preach and to have power to heal sickness and to cast out devil and simon he surnamed peter and james the son of zebedee and john the brother of james and he surnamed them boanerges which be the son of thunder and andrew and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thomas and james the son of alphaeus and thaddaeus and simon the canaanite and juda iscariot which also betrayed him and they go into an house and the multitude cometh together again so that they could not so much a eat bread and when his friend heard of it they go out to lay hold on him for they say he be beside himself and the scribe which come down from jerusalem say he hath beelzebub and by the prince of the devil casteth he out devil and he call them unto him and say unto them in parable how can satan cast out satan and if kingdom be divide against itself that kingdom cannot stand and if house be divide against itself that house cannot stand and if satan rise up against himself and be divide he cannot stand but hath an end no man can enter into strong man house and spoil his good except he will first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his house verily say unto you all sin shall be forgiven unto the son of men and blasphemy wherewith soever they shall blaspheme but he that shall blaspheme against the holy ghost hath never forgiveness but be in danger of eternal damnation because they say he hath an unclean spirit there come then his brother and his mother and stand without sent unto him call him and the multitude sat about him and they say unto him behold thy mother and thy brother without seek for thee and he answer them say who be my mother or my brother and he look round about on them which sat about him and say behold my mother and my brother for whosoever shall do the will of god the same be my brother and my sister and mother and he begin again to teach by the sea side and there be gather unto him great multitude so that he enter into ship and sat in the sea and the whole multitude be by the sea on the land and he taught them many thing by parable and say unto them in his doctrine hearken behold there go out sower to sow and it come to pas a he sow some fell by the way side and the fowl of the air come and devour it up and some fell on stony ground where it have not much earth and immediately it sprang up because it have no depth of earth but when the sun be up it be scorch and because it have no root it wither away and some fell among thorn and the thorn grow up and choked it and it yield no fruit and other fell on good ground and do yield fruit that sprang up and increase and brought forth some thirty and some sixty and some an hundred and he say unto them he that hath ear to hear let him hear and when he be alone they that be about him with the twelve ask of him the parable and he say unto them unto you it be give to know the mystery of the kingdom of god but unto them that be without all these thing be do in parable that see they may see and not perceive and hearing they may hear and not understand l at any time they should be convert and their sin should be forgiven them and he say unto them know ye not this parable and how then will ye know all parable the sower soweth the word and these be they by the way side where the word be sown but when they have heard satan cometh immediately and taketh away the word that be sown in their heart and these be they likewise which be sown on stony ground who when they have heard the word immediately receive it with gladness and have no root in themselves and so endure but for time afterward when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word sake immediately they be offend and these be they which be sown among thorn such a hear the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of rich and the lust of other thing enter in choke the word and it becometh unfruitful and these be they which be sown on good ground such a hear the word and receive it and bring forth fruit some thirtyfold some sixty and some an hundred and he say unto them be candle brought to be put under bushel or under bed and not to be set on candlestick for there be nothing hid which shall not be manifest neither be any thing kept secret but that it should come abroad if any man have ear to hear let him hear and he say unto them take heed what ye hear with what measure ye mete it shall be measure to you and unto you that hear shall more be give for he that hath to him shall be give and he that hath not from him shall be take even that which he hath and he say so be the kingdom of god a if man should cast seed into the ground and should sleep and rise night and day and the seed should spring and grow up he knoweth not how for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade then the ear after that the full corn in the ear but when the fruit be brought forth immediately he putteth in the sickle because the harvest be come and he say whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of god or with what comparison shall we compare it it be like grain of mustard seed which when it be sown in the earth be less than all the seed that be in the earth but when it be sown it groweth up and becometh great than all herb and shooteth out great branch so that the fowl of the air may lodge under the shadow of it and with many such parable spake he the word unto them a they be able to hear it but without parable spake he not unto them and when they be alone he expound all thing to his disciple and the same day when the even be come he saith unto them let u pas over unto the other side and when they have sent away the multitude they take him even a he be in the ship and there be also with him other little ship and there arose great storm of wind and the wave beat into the ship so that it be now full and he be in the hinder part of the ship asleep on pillow and they awake him and say unto him master carest thou not that we perish and he arose and rebuke the wind and say unto the sea peace be still and the wind cease and there be great calm and he say unto them why be ye so fearful how be it that ye have no faith and they fear exceedingly and say one to another what manner of man be this that even the wind and the sea obey him and they come over unto the other side of the sea into the country of the gadarenes and when he be come out of the ship immediately there met him out of the tomb man with an unclean spirit who have his dwell among the tomb and no man could bind him no not with chain because that he have be often bound with fetter and chain and the chain have be plucked asunder by him and the fetter broken in piece neither could any man tame him and always night and day he be in the mountain and in the tomb cry and cut himself with stone but when he saw jesus afar off he ran and worship him and cry with loud voice and say what have to do with thee jesus thou son of the most high god adjure thee by god that thou torment me not for he say unto him come out of the man thou unclean spirit and he ask him what be thy name and he answer say my name be legion for we be many and he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country now there be there nigh unto the mountain great herd of swine feed and all the devil besought him say send u into the swine that we may enter into them and forthwith jesus give them leave and the unclean spirit go out and enter into the swine and the herd ran violently down steep place into the sea they be about two thousand and be choked in the sea and they that fed the swine flee and told it in the city and in the country and they go out to see what it be that be do and they come to jesus and see him that be possess with the devil and have the legion sit and clothed and in his right mind and they be afraid and they that saw it told them how it befell to him that be possess with the devil and also concern the swine and they begin to pray him to depart out of their coast and when he be come into the ship he that have be possess with the devil prayed him that he might be with him howbeit jesus suffer him not but saith unto him go home to thy friend and tell them how great thing the lord hath do for thee and hath have compassion on thee and he depart and begin to publish in decapolis how great thing jesus have do for him and all men do marvel and when jesus be pass over again by ship unto the other side much people gather unto him and he be nigh unto the sea and behold there cometh one of the ruler of the synagogue jairus by name and when he saw him he fell at his foot and besought him greatly say my little daughter lieth at the point of death pray thee come and lay thy hand on her that she may be heal and she shall live and jesus go with him and much people follow him and throng him and certain woman which have an issue of blood twelve year and have suffer many thing of many physician and have spent all that she have and be nothing better but rather grow bad when she have heard of jesus come in the press behind and touch his garment for she say if may touch but his clothes shall be whole and straightway the fountain of her blood be dry up and she felt in her body that she be heal of that plague and jesus immediately know in himself that virtue have go out of him turn him about in the press and say who touch my clothes and his disciple say unto him thou seest the multitude throng thee and sayest thou who touch me and he look round about to see her that have do this thing but the woman fear and tremble know what be do in her come and fell down before him and told him all the truth and he say unto her daughter thy faith hath make thee whole go in peace and be whole of thy plague while he yet spake there come from the ruler of the synagogue house certain which say thy daughter be dead why troublest thou the master any far a soon a jesus heard the word that be spoken he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue be not afraid only believe and he suffer no man to follow him save peter and james and john the brother of james and he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and seeth the tumult and them that wept and wail greatly and when he be come in he saith unto them why make ye this ado and weep the damsel be not dead but sleepeth and they laugh him to scorn but when he have put them all out he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel and them that be with him and entereth in where the damsel be lie and he take the damsel by the hand and say unto her talitha cumi which be be interpret damsel say unto thee arise and straightway the damsel arose and walk for she be of the age of twelve year and they be astonish with great astonishment and he charge them straitly that no man should know it and command that something should be give her to eat and he go out from thence and come into his own country and his disciple follow him and when the sabbath day be come he begin to teach in the synagogue and many hearing him be astonish say from whence hath this man these thing and what wisdom be this which be give unto him that even such mighty work be wrought by his hand be not this the carpenter the son of mary the brother of james and joses and of juda and simon and be not his sister here with u and they be offend at him but jesus say unto them prophet be not without honour but in his own country and among his own kin and in his own house and he could there do no mighty work save that he laid his hand upon few sick folk and heal them and he marvel because of their unbelief and he go round about the village teach and he call unto him the twelve and begin to send them forth by two and two and give them power over unclean spirit and command them that they should take nothing for their journey save staff only no scrip no bread no money in their purse but be shod with sandal and not put on two coat and he say unto them in what place soever ye enter into an house there abide till ye depart from that place and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear you when ye depart thence shake off the dust under your foot for testimony against them verily say unto you it shall be more tolerable for sodom and gomorrha in the day of judgment than for that city and they go out and preach that men should repent and they cast out many devil and anoint with oil many that be sick and heal them and king herod heard of him for his name be spread abroad and he say that john the baptist be risen from the dead and therefore mighty work do shew forth themselves in him others say that it be elia and others say that it be prophet or a one of the prophet but when herod heard thereof he say it be john whom behead he be risen from the dead for herod himself have sent forth and laid hold upon john and bound him in prison for herodias sake his brother philip wife for he have married her for john have say unto herod it be not lawful for thee to have thy brother wife therefore herodias have quarrel against him and would have kill him but she could not for herod fear john know that he be just man and an holy and observe him and when he heard him he do many thing and heard him gladly and when convenient day be come that herod on his birthday make supper to his lord high captain and chief estate of galilee and when the daughter of the say herodias come in and dance and pleased herod and them that sat with him the king say unto the damsel ask of me whatsoever thou wilt and will give it thee and he sware unto her whatsoever thou shalt ask of me will give it thee unto the half of my kingdom and she go forth and say unto her mother what shall ask and she say the head of john the baptist and she come in straightway with haste unto the king and ask say will that thou give me by and by in charger the head of john the baptist and the king be exceed sorry yet for his oath sake and for their sake which sat with him he would not reject her and immediately the king sent an executioner and command his head to be brought and he go and behead him in the prison and brought his head in charger and give it to the damsel and the damsel give it to her mother and when his disciple heard of it they come and take up his corpse and laid it in tomb and the apostle gather themselves together unto jesus and told him all thing both what they have do and what they have taught and he say unto them come ye yourselves apart into desert place and rest while for there be many come and go and they have no leisure so much a to eat and they depart into desert place by ship privately and the people saw them depart and many knew him and ran afoot thither out of all city and outwent them and come together unto him and jesus when he come out saw much people and be move with compassion toward them because they be a sheep not have shepherd and he begin to teach them many thing and when the day be now far spent his disciple come unto him and say this be desert place and now the time be far pass send them away that they may go into the country round about and into the village and buy themselves bread for they have nothing to eat he answer and say unto them give ye them to eat and they say unto him shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread and give them to eat he saith unto them how many loaf have ye go and see and when they knew they say five and two fish and he command them to make all sit down by company upon the green grass and they sat down in rank by hundred and by fifty and when he have take the five loaf and the two fish he look up to heaven and bless and brake the loaf and give them to his disciple to set before them and the two fish divide he among them all and they do all eat and be fill and they take up twelve basket full of the fragment and of the fish and they that do eat of the loaf be about five thousand men and straightway he constrain his disciple to get into the ship and to go to the other side before unto bethsaida while he sent away the people and when he have sent them away he depart into mountain to pray and when even be come the ship be in the midst of the sea and he alone on the land and he saw them toil in row for the wind be contrary unto them and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them walk upon the sea and would have pass by them but when they saw him walk upon the sea they suppose it have be spirit and cry out for they all saw him and be troubled and immediately he talk with them and saith unto them be of good cheer it be be not afraid and he go up unto them into the ship and the wind cease and they be sore amaze in themselves beyond measure and wonder for they consider not the miracle of the loaf for their heart be harden and when they have pass over they come into the land of gennesaret and drew to the shore and when they be come out of the ship straightway they knew him and ran through that whole region round about and begin to carry about in bed those that be sick where they heard he be and whithersoever he enter into village or city or country they laid the sick in the street and besought him that they might touch if it be but the border of his garment and a many a touch him be make whole then come together unto him the pharisee and certain of the scribe which come from jerusalem and when they saw some of his disciple eat bread with defile that be to say with unwashen hand they found fault for the pharisee and all the jew except they wash their hand oft eat not hold the tradition of the elder and when they come from the market except they wash they eat not and many other thing there be which they have receive to hold a the wash of cup and pot brasen vessel and of table then the pharisee and scribe ask him why walk not thy disciple accord to the tradition of the elder but eat bread with unwashen hand he answer and say unto them well hath esaias prophesy of you hypocrite a it be write this people honoureth me with their lip but their heart be far from me howbeit in vain do they worship me teach for doctrine the commandment of men for lay aside the commandment of god ye hold the tradition of men a the wash of pot and cup and many other such like thing ye do and he say unto them full well ye reject the commandment of god that ye may keep your own tradition for moses say honour thy father and thy mother and whoso curseth father or mother let him die the death but ye say if man shall say to his father or mother it be corban that be to say gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profit by me he shall be free and ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother make the word of god of none effect through your tradition which ye have deliver and many such like thing do ye and when he have call all the people unto him he say unto them hearken unto me every one of you and understand there be nothing from without man that enter into him can defile him but the thing which come out of him those be they that defile the man if any man have ear to hear let him hear and when he be enter into the house from the people his disciple ask him concern the parable and he saith unto them be ye so without understand also do ye not perceive that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man it cannot defile him because it entereth not into his heart but into the belly and goeth out into the draught purge all meat and he say that which cometh out of the man that defileth the man for from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thought adultery fornication murder theft covetousness wickedness deceit lasciviousness an evil eye blasphemy pride foolishness all these evil thing come from within and defile the man and from thence he arose and go into the border of tyre and sidon and enter into an house and would have no man know it but he could not be hid for certain woman whose young daughter have an unclean spirit heard of him and come and fell at his foot the woman be greek syrophenician by nation and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter but jesus say unto her let the child first be fill for it be not meet to take the child bread and to cast it unto the dog and she answer and say unto him yes lord yet the dog under the table eat of the child crumb and he say unto her for this say go thy way the devil be go out of thy daughter and when she be come to her house she found the devil go out and her daughter laid upon the bed and again depart from the coast of tyre and sidon he come unto the sea of galilee through the midst of the coast of decapolis and they bring unto him one that be deaf and have an impediment in his speech and they beseech him to put his hand upon him and he take him aside from the multitude and put his finger into his ear and he spit and touch his tongue and look up to heaven he sigh and saith unto him ephphatha that be be open and straightway his ear be open and the string of his tongue be loose and he spake plain and he charge them that they should tell no man but the more he charge them so much the more great deal they publish it and be beyond measure astonish say he hath do all thing well he maketh both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak in those day the multitude be very great and have nothing to eat jesus call his disciple unto him and saith unto them have compassion on the multitude because they have now be with me three day and have nothing to eat and if send them away fast to their own house they will faint by the way for diver of them come from far and his disciple answer him from whence can man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness and he ask them how many loaf have ye and they say seven and he command the people to sit down on the ground and he take the seven loaf and give thanks and brake and give to his disciple to set before them and they do set them before the people and they have few small fish and he bless and command to set them also before them so they do eat and be fill and they take up of the broken meat that be left seven basket and they that have eat be about four thousand and he sent them away and straightway he enter into ship with his disciple and come into the part of dalmanutha and the pharisee come forth and begin to question with him seek of him sign from heaven tempt him and he sigh deeply in his spirit and saith why doth this generation seek after sign verily say unto you there shall no sign be give unto this generation and he left them and enter into the ship again depart to the other side now the disciple have forgotten to take bread neither have they in the ship with them more than one loaf and he charge them say take heed beware of the leaven of the pharisee and of the leaven of herod and they reason among themselves say it be because we have no bread and when jesus knew it he saith unto them why reason ye because ye have no bread perceive ye not yet neither understand have ye your heart yet harden have eye see ye not and have ear hear ye not and do ye not remember when brake the five loaf among five thousand how many basket full of fragment take ye up they say unto him twelve and when the seven among four thousand how many basket full of fragment take ye up and they say seven and he say unto them how be it that ye do not understand and he cometh to bethsaida and they bring blind man unto him and besought him to touch him and he take the blind man by the hand and lead him out of the town and when he have spit on his eye and put his hand upon him he ask him if he saw ought and he look up and say see men a tree walk after that he put his hand again upon his eye and make him look up and he be restore and saw every man clearly and he sent him away to his house say neither go into the town nor tell it to any in the town and jesus go out and his disciple into the town of caesarea philippi and by the way he ask his disciple say unto them whom do men say that be and they answer john the baptist but some say elia and others one of the prophet and he saith unto them but whom say ye that be and peter answereth and saith unto him thou art the christ and he charge them that they should tell no man of him and he begin to teach them that the son of man must suffer many thing and be reject of the elder and of the chief priest and scribe and be kill and after three day rise again and he spake that say openly and peter take him and begin to rebuke him but when he have turn about and look on his disciple he rebuke peter say get thee behind me satan for thou savourest not the thing that be of god but the thing that be of men and when he have call the people unto him with his disciple also he say unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel the same shall save it for what shall it profit man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall man give in exchange for his soul whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my word in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with the holy angel and he say unto them verily say unto you that there be some of them that stand here which shall not taste of death till they have see the kingdom of god come with power and after six day jesus taketh with him peter and james and john and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves and he be transfigure before them and his raiment become shin exceed white a snow so a no fuller on earth can white them and there appear unto them elia with moses and they be talk with jesus and peter answer and say to jesus master it be good for u to be here and let u make three tabernacle one for thee and one for moses and one for elia for he wist not what to say for they be sore afraid and there be cloud that overshadow them and voice come out of the cloud say this be my beloved son hear him and suddenly when they have look round about they saw no man any more save jesus only with themselves and a they come down from the mountain he charge them that they should tell no man what thing they have see till the son of man be risen from the dead and they kept that say with themselves question one with another what the rise from the dead should mean and they ask him say why say the scribe that elia must first come and he answer and told them elia verily cometh first and restoreth all thing and how it be write of the son of man that he must suffer many thing and be set at nought but say unto you that elia be indeed come and they have do unto him whatsoever they list a it be write of him and when he come to his disciple he saw great multitude about them and the scribe question with them and straightway all the people when they beheld him be greatly amaze and run to him salute him and he ask the scribe what question ye with them and one of the multitude answer and say master have brought unto thee my son which hath dumb spirit and wheresoever he taketh him he teareth him and he foameth and gnasheth with his teeth and pineth away and spake to thy disciple that they should cast him out and they could not he answereth him and saith faithless generation how long shall be with you how long shall suffer you bring him unto me and they brought him unto him and when he saw him straightway the spirit tare him and he fell on the ground and wallowed foam and he ask his father how long be it ago since this come unto him and he say of child and ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire and into the water to destroy him but if thou canst do any thing have compassion on u and help u jesus say unto him if thou canst believe all thing be possible to him that believeth and straightway the father of the child cry out and say with tear lord believe help thou mine unbelief when jesus saw that the people come run together he rebuke the foul spirit say unto him thou dumb and deaf spirit charge thee come out of him and enter no more into him and the spirit cry and rent him sore and come out of him and he be a one dead insomuch that many say he be dead but jesus take him by the hand and lift him up and he arose and when he be come into the house his disciple ask him privately why could not we cast him out and he say unto them this kind can come forth by nothing but by prayer and fast and they depart thence and pass through galilee and he would not that any man should know it for he taught his disciple and say unto them the son of man be deliver into the hand of men and they shall kill him and after that he be kill he shall rise the third day but they understood not that say and be afraid to ask him and he come to capernaum and be in the house he ask them what be it that ye dispute among yourselves by the way but they held their peace for by the way they have dispute among themselves who should be the great and he sat down and call the twelve and saith unto them if any man desire to be first the same shall be last of all and servant of all and he take child and set him in the midst of them and when he have take him in his arm he say unto them whosoever shall receive one of such child in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth not me but him that sent me and john answer him say master we saw one cast out devil in thy name and he followeth not u and we forbad him because he followeth not u but jesus say forbid him not for there be no man which shall do miracle in my name that can lightly speak evil of me for he that be not against u be on our part for whosoever shall give you cup of water to drink in my name because ye belong to christ verily say unto you he shall not lose his reward and whosoever shall offend one of these little one that believe in me it be well for him that millstone be hang about his neck and he be cast into the sea and if thy hand offend thee cut it off it be well for thee to enter into life maim than have two hand to go into hell into the fire that never shall be quenched where their worm dieth not and the fire be not quenched and if thy foot offend thee cut it off it be well for thee to enter halt into life than have two foot to be cast into hell into the fire that never shall be quenched where their worm dieth not and the fire be not quenched and if thine eye offend thee pluck it out it be well for thee to enter into the kingdom of god with one eye than have two eye to be cast into hell fire where their worm dieth not and the fire be not quenched for every one shall be salt with fire and every sacrifice shall be salt with salt salt be good but if the salt have lose his saltness wherewith will ye season it have salt in yourselves and have peace one with another and he arose from thence and cometh into the coast of judaea by the farther side of jordan and the people resort unto him again and a he be wont he taught them again and the pharisee come to him and ask him be it lawful for man to put away his wife tempt him and he answer and say unto them what do moses command you and they say moses suffer to write bill of divorcement and to put her away and jesus answer and say unto them for the hardness of your heart he write you this precept but from the begin of the creation god make them male and female for this cause shall man leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh so then they be no more twain but one flesh what therefore god hath join together let not man put asunder and in the house his disciple ask him again of the same matter and he saith unto them whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another committeth adultery against her and if woman shall put away her husband and be married to another she committeth adultery and they brought young child to him that he should touch them and his disciple rebuke those that brought them but when jesus saw it he be much displeased and say unto them suffer the little child to come unto me and forbid them not for of such be the kingdom of god verily say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god a little child he shall not enter therein and he take them up in his arm put his hand upon them and bless them and when he be go forth into the way there come one run and kneel to him and ask him good master what shall do that may inherit eternal life and jesus say unto him why callest thou me good there be none good but one that be god thou knowest the commandment do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honour thy father and mother and he answer and say unto him master all these have observe from my youth then jesus beholding him love him and say unto him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me and he be sad at that say and go away grieve for he have great possession and jesus look round about and saith unto his disciple how hardly shall they that have rich enter into the kingdom of god and the disciple be astonish at his word but jesus answereth again and saith unto them child how hard be it for them that trust in rich to enter into the kingdom of god it be easy for camel to go through the eye of needle than for rich man to enter into the kingdom of god and they be astonish out of measure say among themselves who then can be save and jesus look upon them saith with men it be impossible but not with god for with god all thing be possible then peter begin to say unto him lo we have left all and have follow thee and jesus answer and say verily say unto you there be no man that hath left house or brother or sister or father or mother or wife or child or land for my sake and the gospel but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time house and brother and sister and mother and child and land with persecution and in the world to come eternal life but many that be first shall be last and the last first and they be in the way go up to jerusalem and jesus go before them and they be amaze and a they follow they be afraid and he take again the twelve and begin to tell them what thing should happen unto him say behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be deliver unto the chief priest and unto the scribe and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the gentile and they shall mock him and shall scourge him and shall spit upon him and shall kill him and the third day he shall rise again and james and john the son of zebedee come unto him say master we would that thou shouldest do for u whatsoever we shall desire and he say unto them what would ye that should do for you they say unto him grant unto u that we may sit one on thy right hand and the other on thy left hand in thy glory but jesus say unto them ye know not what ye ask can ye drink of the cup that drink of and be baptize with the baptism that be baptize with and they say unto him we can and jesus say unto them ye shall indeed drink of the cup that drink of and with the baptism that be baptize withal shall ye be baptize but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand be not mine to give but it shall be give to them for whom it be prepared and when the ten heard it they begin to be much displeased with james and john but jesus call them to him and saith unto them ye know that they which be account to rule over the gentile exercise lordship over them and their great one exercise authority upon them but so shall it not be among you but whosoever will be great among you shall be your minister and whosoever of you will be the chiefest shall be servant of all for even the son of man come not to be minister unto but to minister and to give his life ransom for many and they come to jericho and a he go out of jericho with his disciple and great number of people blind bartimaeus the son of timaeus sat by the highway side beg and when he heard that it be jesus of nazareth he begin to cry out and say jesus thou son of david have mercy on me and many charge him that he should hold his peace but he cry the more great deal thou son of david have mercy on me and jesus stood still and command him to be call and they call the blind man say unto him be of good comfort rise he calleth thee and he cast away his garment rise and come to jesus and jesus answer and say unto him what wilt thou that should do unto thee the blind man say unto him lord that might receive my sight and jesus say unto him go thy way thy faith hath make thee whole and immediately he receive his sight and follow jesus in the way and when they come nigh to jerusalem unto bethphage and bethany at the mount of olive he sendeth forth two of his disciple and saith unto them go your way into the village over against you and a soon a ye be enter into it ye shall find colt tie whereon never man sat loose him and bring him and if any man say unto you why do ye this say ye that the lord hath need of him and straightway he will send him hither and they go their way and found the colt tie by the door without in place where two way met and they loose him and certain of them that stood there say unto them what do ye loose the colt and they say unto them even a jesus have command and they let them go and they brought the colt to jesus and cast their garment on him and he sat upon him and many spread their garment in the way and others cut down branch off the tree and straw them in the way and they that go before and they that follow cry say hosanna bless be he that cometh in the name of the lord bless be the kingdom of our father david that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the high and jesus enter into jerusalem and into the temple and when he have look round about upon all thing and now the eventide be come he go out unto bethany with the twelve and on the morrow when they be come from bethany he be hungry and see fig tree afar off have leaf he come if haply he might find any thing thereon and when he come to it he found nothing but leaf for the time of fig be not yet and jesus answer and say unto it no man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever and his disciple heard it and they come to jerusalem and jesus go into the temple and begin to cast out them that sell and bought in the temple and overthrew the table of the moneychangers and the seat of them that sell dove and would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple and he taught say unto them be it not write my house shall be call of all nation the house of prayer but ye have make it den of thief and the scribe and chief priest heard it and sought how they might destroy him for they fear him because all the people be astonish at his doctrine and when even be come he go out of the city and in the morning a they pass by they saw the fig tree dry up from the root and peter call to remembrance saith unto him master behold the fig tree which thou cursedst be wither away and jesus answer saith unto them have faith in god for verily say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou remove and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those thing which he saith shall come to pas he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore say unto you what thing soever ye desire when ye pray believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them and when ye stand pray forgive if ye have ought against any that your father also which be in heaven may forgive you your trespass but if ye do not forgive neither will your father which be in heaven forgive your trespass and they come again to jerusalem and a he be walk in the temple there come to him the chief priest and the scribe and the elder and say unto him by what authority doest thou these thing and who give thee this authority to do these thing and jesus answer and say unto them will also ask of you one question and answer me and will tell you by what authority do these thing the baptism of john be it from heaven or of men answer me and they reason with themselves say if we shall say from heaven he will say why then do ye not believe him but if we shall say of men they fear the people for all men count john that he be prophet indeed and they answer and say unto jesus we cannot tell and jesus answer saith unto them neither do tell you by what authority do these thing and he begin to speak unto them by parable certain man plant vineyard and set an hedge about it and digged place for the winefat and built tower and let it out to husbandman and go into far country and at the season he sent to the husbandman servant that he might receive from the husbandman of the fruit of the vineyard and they caught him and beat him and sent him away empty and again he sent unto them another servant and at him they cast stone and wound him in the head and sent him away shamefully handle and again he sent another and him they kill and many others beating some and kill some have yet therefore one son his wellbeloved he sent him also last unto them say they will reverence my son but those husbandman say among themselves this be the heir come let u kill him and the inheritance shall be our and they take him and kill him and cast him out of the vineyard what shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do he will come and destroy the husbandman and will give the vineyard unto others and have ye not read this scripture the stone which the builder reject be become the head of the corner this be the lord do and it be marvellous in our eye and they sought to lay hold on him but fear the people for they knew that he have spoken the parable against them and they left him and go their way and they send unto him certain of the pharisee and of the herodians to catch him in his word and when they be come they say unto him master we know that thou art true and carest for no man for thou regardest not the person of men but teachest the way of god in truth be it lawful to give tribute to caesar or not shall we give or shall we not give but he know their hypocrisy say unto them why tempt ye me bring me penny that may see it and they brought it and he saith unto them whose be this image and superscription and they say unto him caesar and jesus answer say unto them render to caesar the thing that be caesar and to god the thing that be god and they marvel at him then come unto him the sadducee which say there be no resurrection and they ask him say master moses write unto u if man brother die and leave his wife behind him and leave no child that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother now there be seven brother and the first take wife and die left no seed and the second take her and die neither left he any seed and the third likewise and the seven have her and left no seed last of all the woman die also in the resurrection therefore when they shall rise whose wife shall she be of them for the seven have her to wife and jesus answer say unto them do ye not therefore err because ye know not the scripture neither the power of god for when they shall rise from the dead they neither marry nor be give in marriage but be a the angel which be in heaven and a touch the dead that they rise have ye not read in the book of moses how in the bush god spake unto him say be the god of abraham and the god of

discreetly he say unto him thou art not far from the kingdom of god and no man after that durst ask him any question and jesus answer and say while he taught in the temple how say the scribe that christ be the son of david for david himself say by the holy ghost the lord say to my lord sit thou on my right hand till make thine enemy thy footstool david therefore himself calleth him lord and whence be he then his son and the common people heard him gladly and he say unto them in his doctrine beware of the scribe which love to go in long clothing and love salutation in the marketplace and the chief seat in the synagogue and the uppermost room at feast which devour widow house and for pretence make long prayer these shall receive great damnation and jesus sat over against the treasury and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury and many that be rich cast in much and there come certain poor widow and she threw in two mite which make farthing and he call unto him his

together and there arose certain and bare false witness against him say we heard him say will destroy this temple that be make with hand and within three day will build another make without hand but neither so do their witness agree together and the high priest stood up in the midst and ask jesus say answerest thou nothing what be it which these witness against thee but he held his peace and answer nothing again the high priest ask him and say unto him art thou the christ the son of the bless and jesus say be and ye shall see the son of man sit on the right hand of power and come in the cloud of heaven then the high priest rent his clothes and saith what need we any far witness ye have heard the blasphemy what think ye and they all condemn him to be guilty of death and some begin to

with the old and no man putteth new wine into old bottle else the new wine will burst the bottle and be spill and the bottle shall perish but new wine must be put into new bottle and both be preserve no man also have drunk old wine straightway desireth new for he saith the old be well and it come to pas on the second sabbath after the first that he go through the corn field and his disciple

taught and there be man whose right hand be wither and the scribe and pharisee watch him whether he would heal on the sabbath day that they might find an accusation against him but he knew their thought and say to the man which have the wither hand rise up and stand forth in the midst and he arose and stood forth then say jesus unto them will ask you one thing be it lawful on the sabbath day to do good or to do evil to save life or to destroy it and look round about upon them all he say unto the man stretch forth thy hand and he do so and his hand be restore whole a the other and they be

unclean spirit and they be heal and the whole multitude sought to touch him for there go virtue out of him and heal them all and he lift up his eye on his disciple and say bless be ye poor for yours be the kingdom of god bless be ye that hunger now for ye shall be fill bless be ye that weep now for ye shall laugh bless be ye when men shall hate you and when they shall separate you from their company and shall reproach you and cast out your name a evil for the son of man sake rejoice ye in that day and leap for joy for behold your reward be great in heaven for in the like manner do their father unto the prophet but woe unto you that be rich for ye have receive your consolation woe unto you that be full for ye shall hunger woe unto you that laugh now for ye shall mourn and weep woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you for so do their father to the false prophet but say unto you which hear love your enemy do good to them which hate you bless them that curse you and pray for them which despitefully use you and unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also give to every man that asketh of thee and of him that taketh away thy good ask them not again and a ye would that men should do to you do ye also to them likewise for if ye love them which love you what thank have ye for sinner also love those that love them and if ye do good to them which do good to you what thank have ye for sinner also do even the same and if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive what thank have ye for sinner also lend to sinner to receive a much again but love ye your enemy and do good and lend hop for nothing again and your reward shall be great and ye shall be the child of the high for he be kind unto the unthankful and to the evil be ye therefore merciful a your father also be merciful judge not and ye shall not be judged condemn not and ye shall not be condemn forgive and ye shall be forgiven give and it shall be give unto you good measure press down and shaken together and run over shall men give into your bosom for with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measure to you again and he spake parable unto them can the blind lead the blind shall they not both fall into the ditch the disciple be not above his master but every one that be perfect shall be a his master and why beholdest thou the mote that be in thy brother eye but perceivest not the beam that be in thine own eye either how canst thou say to thy brother brother let me pull out the mote that be in thine eye when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that be in thine own eye thou hypocrite cast out first the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that be in thy brother eye for good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit neither doth corrupt tree bring forth good fruit for every tree be know by his own fruit for of thorn men do not gather fig nor of bramble bush gather they grape good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which be good and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which be evil for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh and why call ye me lord lord and do not the thing which say whosoever cometh to me and heareth my saying and doeth them will shew you to whom he be like he be like man which built an house and digged deep and laid the foundation on rock and when the flood arose the stream beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it for it be found upon rock but he that heareth and doeth not be like man that without foundation built an house upon the earth against which the stream do beat vehemently and immediately it fell and the ruin of that house be great now when he have end all his saying in the audience of the people he enter into capernaum and certain centurion servant who be dear unto him be sick and ready to die and when he heard of jesus he sent unto him the elder of the jew beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant and when they come to jesus they besought him instantly say that he be worthy for whom he should do this for he loveth our nation and he hath built u synagogue then jesus go with them and when he be now not far from the house the centurion sent friend to him say unto him lord trouble not thyself for be not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof wherefore neither thought myself worthy to come unto thee but say in word and my servant shall be heal for also be man set under authority have under me soldier and say unto one go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it when jesus heard these thing he marvel at him and turn him about and say unto the people that follow him say unto you have not found so great faith no not in israel and they that be sent return to the house found the servant whole that have be sick and it come to pas the day after that he go into city call nain and many of his disciple go with him and much people now when he come nigh to the gate of the city behold there be dead man carry out the only son of his mother and she be widow and much people of the city be with her and when the lord saw her he have compassion on her and say unto her weep not and he come and touch the bier and they that bare him stood still and he say young man say unto thee arise and he that be dead sat up and begin to speak and he deliver him to his mother and there come fear on all and they glorify god say that great prophet be risen up among u and that god hath visit his people and this rumour of him go forth throughout all judaea and throughout all the region round about and the disciple of john shew him of all these thing and john call unto him two of his disciple sent them to jesus say art thou he that should come or look we for another when the men be come unto him they say john baptist hath sent u unto thee say art thou he that should come or look we for another and in that same hour he cure many of their infirmity and plague and of evil spirit and unto many that be blind he give sight then jesus answer say unto them go your way and tell john what thing ye have see and heard how that the blind see the lame walk the leper be cleanse the deaf hear the dead be raise to the poor the gospel be preach and bless be he whosoever shall not be offend in me and when the messenger of john be depart he begin to speak unto the people concern john what go ye out into the wilderness for to see reed shaken with the wind but what go ye out for to see man clothed in soft raiment behold they which be gorgeously apparelled and live delicately be in king court but what go ye out for to see prophet yea say unto you and much more than prophet this be he of whom it be write behold send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee for say unto you among those that be born of woman there be not great prophet than john the baptist but he that be least in the kingdom of god be great than he and all the people that heard him and the publican justified god be baptize with the baptism of john but the pharisee and lawyer reject the counsel of god against themselves be not baptize of him and the lord say whereunto then shall liken the men of this generation and to what be they like they be like unto child sit in the marketplace and call one to another and say we have piped unto you and ye have not dance we have mourn to you and ye have not wept for john the baptist come neither eat bread nor drinking wine and ye say he hath devil the son of man be come eat and drinking and ye say behold gluttonous man and winebibber friend of publican and sinner but wisdom be justified of all her child and one of the pharisee desire him that he would eat with him and he go into the pharisee house and sat down to meat and behold woman in the city which be sinner when she knew that jesus sat at meat in the pharisee house brought an alabaster box of ointment and stood at his foot behind him weep and begin to wash his foot with tear and do wipe them with the hair of her head and kiss his foot and anoint them with the ointment now when the pharisee which have bidden him saw it he spake within himself say this man if he be prophet would have know who and what manner of woman this be that toucheth him for she be sinner and jesus answer say unto him simon have somewhat to say unto thee and he saith master say on there be certain creditor which have two debtor the one owe five hundred penny and the other fifty and when they have nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him most simon answer and say suppose that he to whom he forgave most and he say unto him thou hast rightly judged and he turn to the woman and say unto simon seest thou this woman enter into thine house thou gavest me no water for my foot but she hath wash my foot with tear and wipe them with the hair of her head thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time come in hath not cease to kiss my foot my head with oil thou didst not anoint but this woman hath anoint my foot with ointment wherefore say unto thee her sin which be many be forgiven for she love much but to whom little be forgiven the same loveth little and he say unto her thy sin be forgiven and they that sat at meat with him begin to say within themselves who be this that forgiveth sin also and he say to the woman thy faith hath save thee go in peace and it come to pas afterward that he go throughout every city and village preach and shew the glad tidings of the kingdom of god and the twelve be with him and certain woman which have be heal of evil spirit and infirmity mary call magdalene out of whom go seven devil and joanna the wife of chuza herod steward and susanna and many others which minister unto him of their substance and when much people be gather together and be come to him out of every city he spake by parable sower go out to sow his seed and a he sow some fell by the way side and it be trodden down and the fowl of the air devour it and some fell upon rock and a soon a it be sprung up it wither away because it lack moisture and some fell among thorn and the thorn sprang up with it and choked it and other fell on good ground and sprang up and bare fruit an hundredfold and when he have say these thing he cry he that hath ear to hear let him hear and his disciple ask him say what might this parable be and he say unto you it be give to know the mystery of the kingdom of god but to others in parable that see they might not see and hearing they might not understand now the parable be this the seed be the word of god those by the way side be they that hear then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of their heart l they should believe and be save they on the rock be they which when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no root which for while believe and in time of temptation fall away and that which fell among thorn be they which when they have heard go forth and be choked with care and rich and pleasure of this life and bring no fruit to perfection but that on the good ground be they which in an honest and good heart have heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience no man when he hath light candle covereth it with vessel or putteth it under bed but setteth it on candlestick that they which enter in may see the light for nothing be secret that shall not be make manifest neither any thing hid that shall not be know and come abroad take heed therefore how ye hear for whosoever hath to him shall be give and whosoever hath not from him shall be take even that which he seemeth to have then come to him his mother and his brother and could not come at him for the press and it be told him by certain which say thy mother and thy brother stand without desire to see thee and he answer and say unto them my mother and my brother be these which hear the word of god and do it now it come to pas on certain day that he go into ship with his disciple and he say unto them let u go over unto the other side of the lake and they launch forth but a they sail he fell asleep and there come down storm of wind on the lake and they be fill with water and be in jeopardy and they come to him and awoke him say master master we perish then he arose and rebuke the wind and the rag of the water and they cease and there be calm and he say unto them where be your faith and they be afraid wonder say one to another what manner of man be this for he commandeth even the wind and water and they obey him and they arrive at the country of the gadarenes which be over against galilee and when he go forth to land there met him out of the city certain man which have devil long time and ware no clothes neither abode in any house but in the tomb when he saw jesus he cry out and fell down before him and with loud voice say what have to do with thee jesus thou son of god most high beseech thee torment me not for he have command the unclean spirit to come out of the man for oftentimes it have caught him and he be kept bound with chain and in fetter and he brake the band and be driven of the devil into the wilderness and jesus ask him say what be thy name and he say legion because many devil be enter into him and they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep and there be there an herd of many swine feed on the mountain and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them and he suffer them then go the devil out of the man and enter into the swine and the herd ran violently down steep place into the lake and be choked when they that fed them saw what be do they flee and go and told it in the city and in the country then they go out to see what be do and come to jesus and found the man out of whom the devil be depart sit at the foot of jesus clothed and in his right mind and they be afraid they also which saw it told them by what mean he that be possess of the devil be heal then the whole multitude of the country of the gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them for they be take with great fear and he go up into the ship and return back again now the man out of whom the devil be depart besought him that he might be with him but jesus sent him away say return to thine own house and shew how great thing god hath do unto thee and he go his way and publish throughout the whole city how great thing jesus have do unto him and it come to pas that when jesus be return the people gladly receive him for they be all wait for him and behold there come man name jairus and he be ruler of the synagogue and he fell down at jesus foot and besought him that he would come into his house for he have one only daughter about twelve year of age and she lay die but a he go the people throng him and woman have an issue of blood twelve year which have spent all her living upon physician neither could be heal of any come behind him and touch the border of his garment and immediately her issue of blood stanch and jesus say who touch me when all deny peter and they that be with him say master the multitude throng thee and press thee and sayest thou who touch me and jesus say somebody hath touch me for perceive that virtue be go out of me and when the woman saw that she be not hid she come tremble and fall down before him she declare unto him before all the people for what cause she have touch him and how she be heal immediately and he say unto her daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath make thee whole go in peace while he yet spake there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue house say to him thy daughter be dead trouble not the master but when jesus heard it he answer him say fear not believe only and she shall be make whole and when he come into the house he suffer no man to go in save peter and james and john and the father and the mother of the maiden and all wept and bewail her but he say weep not she be not dead but sleepeth and they laugh him to scorn know that she be dead and he put them all out and take her by the hand and call say maid arise and her spirit come again and she arose straightway and he command to give her meat and her parent be astonish but he charge them that they should tell no man what be do then he call his twelve disciple together and give them power and authority over all devil and to cure disease and he sent them to preach the kingdom of god and to heal the sick and he say unto them take nothing for your journey neither stave nor scrip neither bread neither money neither have two coat apiece and whatsoever house ye enter into there abide and thence depart and whosoever will not receive you when ye go out of that city shake off the very dust from your foot for testimony against them and they depart and go through the town preach the gospel and heal every where now herod the tetrarch heard of all that be do by him and he be perplexed because that it be say of some that john be risen from the dead and of some that elia have appear and of others that one of the old prophet be risen again and herod say john have behead but who be this of whom hear such thing and he desire to see him and the apostle when they be return told him all that they have do and he take them and go aside privately into desert place belonging to the city call bethsaida and the people when they knew it follow him and he receive them and spake unto them of the kingdom of god and heal them that have need of heal and when the day begin to wear away then come the twelve and say unto him send the multitude away that they may go into the town and country round about and lodge and get victual for we be here in desert place but he say unto them give ye them to eat and they say we have no more but five loaf and two fish except we should go and buy meat for all this people for they be about five thousand men and he say to his disciple make them sit down by fifty in company and they do so and make them all sit down then he take the five loaf and the two fish and look up to heaven he bless them and brake and give to the disciple to set before the multitude and they do eat and be all fill and there be take up of fragment that remain to them twelve basket and it come to pas a he be alone pray his disciple be with him and he ask them say whom say the people that be they answer say john the baptist but some say elia and others say that one of the old prophet be risen again he say unto them but whom say ye that be peter answer say the christ of god and he straitly charge them and command them to tell no man that thing say the son of man must suffer many thing and be reject of the elder and chief priest and scribe and be slain and be raise the third day and he say to them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it for what be man advantage if he gain the whole world and lose himself or be cast away for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my word of him shall the son of man be ashamed when he shall come in his own glory and in his father and of the holy angel but tell you of truth there be some stand here which shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of god and it come to pas about an eight day after these saying he take peter and john and james and go up into mountain to pray and a he prayed the fashion of his countenance be alter and his raiment be white and glistering and behold there talk with him two men which be moses and elia who appear in glory and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at jerusalem but peter and they that be with him be heavy with sleep and when they be awake they saw his glory and the two men that stood with him and it come to pas a they depart from him peter say unto jesus master it be good for u to be here and let u make three tabernacle one for thee and one for moses and one for elia not know what he say while he thus spake there come cloud and overshadow them and they fear a they enter into the cloud and there come voice out of the cloud say this be my beloved son hear him and when the voice be past jesus be found alone and they kept it close and told no man in those day any of those thing which they have see and it come to pas that on the next day when they be come down from the hill much people met him and behold man of the company cry out say master beseech thee look upon my son for he be mine only child and lo spirit taketh him and he suddenly crieth out and it teareth him that he foameth again and bruising him hardly departeth from him and besought thy disciple to cast him out and they could not and jesus answer say faithless and perverse generation how long shall be with you and suffer you bring thy son hither and a he be yet come the devil threw him down and tare him and jesus rebuke the unclean spirit and heal the child and deliver him again to his father and they be all amaze at the mighty power of god but while they wonder every one at all thing which jesus do he say unto his disciple let these saying sink down into your ear for the son of man shall be deliver into the hand of men but they understood not this say and it be hid from them that they perceive it not and they fear to ask him of that say then there arose reason among them which of them should be great and jesus perceive the thought of their heart take child and set him by him and say unto them whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me for he that be least among you all the same shall be great and john answer and say master we saw one cast out devil in thy name and we forbad him because he followeth not with u and jesus say unto him forbid him not for he that be not against u be for u and it come to pas when the time be come that he should be receive up he stedfastly set his face to go to jerusalem and sent messenger before his face and they go and enter into village of the samaritan to make ready for him and they do not receive him because his face be a though he would go to jerusalem and when his disciple james and john saw this they say lord wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them even a elia do but he turn and rebuke them and say ye know not what manner of spirit ye be of for the son of man be not come to destroy men life but to save them and they go to another village and it come to pas that a they go in the way certain man say unto him lord will follow thee whithersoever thou goest and jesus say unto him fox have hole and bird of the air have nest but the son of man hath not where to lay his head and he say unto another follow me but he say lord suffer me first to go and bury my father jesus say unto him let the dead bury their dead but go thou and preach the kingdom of god and another also say lord will follow thee but let me first go bid them farewell which be at home at my house and jesus say unto him no man have put his hand to the plough and look back be fit for the kingdom of god after these thing the lord appoint other seventy also and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place whither he himself would come therefore say he unto them the harvest truly be great but the labourer be few pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he would send forth labourer into his harvest go your way behold send you forth a lamb among wolf carry neither purse nor scrip nor shoe and salute no man by the way and into whatsoever house ye enter first say peace be to this house and if the son of peace be there your peace shall rest upon it if not it shall turn to you again and in the same house remain eat and drinking such thing a they give for the labourer be worthy of his hire go not from house to house and into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you eat such thing a be set before you and heal the sick that be therein and say unto them the kingdom of god be come nigh unto you but into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you not go your way out into the street of the same and say even the very dust of your city which cleaveth on u we do wipe off against you notwithstanding be ye sure of this that the kingdom of god be come nigh unto you but say unto you that it shall be more tolerable in that day for sodom than for that city woe unto thee chorazin woe unto thee bethsaida for if the mighty work have be do in tyre and sidon which have be do in you they have great while ago repent sit in sackcloth and ash but it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon at the judgment than for you and thou capernaum which art exalt to heaven shalt be thrust down to hell he that heareth you heareth me and he that despiseth you despiseth me and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me and the seventy return again with joy say lord even the devil be subject unto u through thy name and he say unto them beheld satan a lightning fall from heaven behold give unto you power to tread on serpent and scorpion and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any mean hurt you notwithstanding in this rejoice not that the spirit be subject unto you but rather rejoice because your name be write in heaven in that hour jesus rejoice in spirit and say thank thee father lord of heaven and earth that thou hast hid these thing from the wise and prudent and hast reveal them unto babe even so father for so it seem good in thy sight all thing be deliver to me of my father and no man knoweth who the son be but the father and who the father be but the son and he to whom the son will reveal him and he turn him unto his disciple and say privately bless be the eye which see the thing that ye see for tell you that many prophet and king have desire to see those thing which ye see and have not see them and to hear those thing which ye hear and have not heard them and behold certain lawyer stood up and tempt him say master what shall do to inherit eternal life he say unto him what be write in the law how readest thou and he answer say thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind and thy neighbour a thyself and he say unto him thou hast answer right this do and thou shalt live but he willing to justify himself say unto jesus and who be my neighbour and jesus answer say certain man go down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thief which strip him of his raiment and wound him and depart leave him half dead and by chance there come down certain priest that way and when he saw him he pass by on the other side and likewise levite when he be at the place come and look on him and pass by on the other side but certain samaritan a he journeyed come where he be and when he saw him he have compassion on him and go to him and bound up his wound pour in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and take care of him and on the morrow when he depart he take out two penny and give them to the host and say unto him take care of him and whatsoever thou spendest more when come again will repay thee which now of these three thinkest thou be neighbour unto him that fell among the thief and he say he that shew mercy on him then say jesus unto him go and do thou likewise now it come to pas a they go that he enter into certain village and certain woman name martha receive him into her house and she have sister call mary which also sat at jesus foot and heard his word but martha be cumber about much serve and come to him and say lord dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone bid her therefore that she help me and jesus answer and say unto her martha martha thou art careful and troubled about many thing but one thing be needful and mary hath chosen that good part which shall not be take away from her and it come to pas that a he be pray in certain place when he cease one of his disciple say unto him lord teach u to pray a john also taught his disciple and he say unto them when ye pray say our father which art in heaven hallow be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be do a in heaven so in earth give u day by day our daily bread and forgive u our sin for we also forgive every one that be indebted to u and lead u not into temptation but deliver u from evil and he say unto them which of you shall have friend and shall go unto him at midnight and say unto him friend lend me three loaf for friend of mine in his journey be come to me and have nothing to set before him and he from within shall answer and say trouble me not the door be now shut and my child be with me in bed cannot rise and give thee say unto you though he will not rise and give him because he be his friend yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him a many a he needeth and say unto you ask and it shall be give you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be open unto you for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be open if son shall ask bread of any of you that be father will he give him stone or if he ask fish will he for fish give him serpent or if he shall ask an egg will he offer him scorpion if ye then be evil know how to give good gift unto your child how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him and he be cast out devil and it be dumb and it come to pas when the devil be go out the dumb spake and the people wonder but some of them say he casteth out devil through beelzebub the chief of the devil and others tempt him sought of him sign from heaven but he know their thought say unto them every kingdom divide against itself be brought to desolation and house divide against house falleth if satan also be divide against himself how shall his kingdom stand because ye say that cast out devil through beelzebub and if by beelzebub cast out devil by whom do your son cast them out therefore shall they be your judge but if with the finger of god cast out devil no doubt the kingdom of god be come upon you when strong man arm keepeth his palace his good be in peace but when strong than he shall come upon him and overcome him he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trust and divideth his spoil he that be not with me be against me and he that gathereth not with me scattereth when the unclean spirit be go out of man he walketh through dry place seek rest and find none he saith will return unto my house whence come out and when he cometh he findeth it swept and garnish then goeth he and taketh to him seven other spirit more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man be bad than the first and it come to pas a he spake these thing certain woman of the company lift up her voice and say unto him bless be the womb that bare thee and the pap which thou hast suck but he say yea rather bless be they that hear the word of god and keep it and when the people be gather thick together he begin to say this be an evil generation they seek sign and there shall no sign be give it but the sign of jonas the prophet for a jonas be sign unto the ninevites so shall also the son of man be to this generation the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them for she come from the utmost part of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold great than solomon be here the men of nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for they repent at the preach of jonas and behold great than jonas be here no man when he hath light candle putteth it in secret place neither under bushel but on candlestick that they which come in may see the light the light of the body be the eye therefore when thine eye be single thy whole body also be full of light but when thine eye be evil thy body also be full of darkness take heed therefore that the light which be in thee be not darkness if thy whole body therefore be full of light have no part dark the whole shall be full of light a when the bright shin of candle doth give thee light and a he spake certain pharisee besought him to dine with him and he go in and sat down to meat and when the pharisee saw it he marvel that he have not first wash before dinner and the lord say unto him now do ye pharisee make clean the outside of the cup and the platter but your inward part be full of raven and wickedness ye fool do not he that make that which be without make that which be within also but rather give alms of such thing a ye have and behold all thing be clean unto you but woe unto you pharisee for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herb and pas over judgment and the love of god these ought ye to have do and not to leave the other undone woe unto you pharisee for ye love the uppermost seat in the synagogue and greeting in the market woe unto you scribe and pharisee hypocrite for ye be a graf which appear not and the men that walk over them be not aware of them then answer one of the lawyer and say unto him master thus say thou reproachest u also and he say woe unto you also ye lawyer for ye lade men with burden grievous to be borne and ye yourselves touch not the burden with one of your finger woe unto you for ye build the sepulchre of the prophet and your father kill them truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deed of your father for they indeed kill them and ye build their sepulchre therefore also say the wisdom of god will send them prophet and apostle and some of them they shall slay and persecute that the blood of all the prophet which be shed from the foundation of the world may be require of this generation from the blood of abel unto the blood of zacharias which perish between the altar and the temple verily say unto you it shall be require of this generation woe unto you lawyer for ye have take away the key of knowledge ye enter not in yourselves and them that be enter in ye hinder and a he say these thing unto them the scribe and the pharisee begin to urge him vehemently and to provoke him to speak of many thing lay wait for him and seek to catch something out of his mouth that they might accuse him in the mean time when there be gather together an innumerable multitude of people insomuch that they trode one upon another he begin to say unto his disciple first of all beware ye of the leaven of the pharisee which be hypocrisy for there be nothing cover that shall not be reveal neither hid that shall not be know therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closet shall be proclaim upon the housetop and say unto you my friend be not afraid of them that kill the body and after that have no more that they can do but will forewarn you whom ye shall fear fear him which after he hath kill hath power to cast into hell yea say unto you fear him be not five sparrow sell for two farthing and not one of them be forgotten before god but even the very hair of your head be all numbered fear not therefore ye be of more value than many sparrow also say unto you whosoever shall confess me before men him shall the son of man also confess before the angel of god but he that denieth me before men shall be deny before the angel of god and whosoever shall speak word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but unto him that blasphemeth against the holy ghost it shall not be forgiven and when they bring you unto the synagogue and unto magistrate and power take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer or what ye shall say for the holy ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say and one of the company say unto him master speak to my brother that he divide the inheritance with me and he say unto him man who make me judge or divider over you and he say unto them take heed and beware of covetousness for man life consisteth not in the abundance of the thing which he possesseth and he spake parable unto them say the ground of certain rich man brought forth plentifully and he thought within himself say what shall do because have no room where to bestow my fruit and he say this will do will pull down my barn and build great and there will bestow all my fruit and my good and will say to my soul soul thou hast much good laid up for many year take thine ease eat drink and be merry but god say unto him thou fool this night thy soul shall be require of thee then whose shall those thing be which thou hast provide so be he that layeth up treasure for himself and be not rich toward god and he say unto his disciple therefore say unto you take no thought for your life what ye shall eat neither for the body what ye shall put on the life be more than meat and the body be more than raiment consider the raven for they neither sow nor reap which neither have storehouse nor barn and god feedeth them how much more be ye well than the fowl and which of you with take thought can add to his stature one cubit if ye then be not able to do that thing which be least why take ye thought for the rest consider the lily how they grow they toil not they spin not and yet say unto you that solomon in all his glory be not arrayed like one of these if then god so clothe the grass which be to day in the field and to morrow be cast into the oven how much more will he clothe you ye of little faith and seek not ye what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink neither be ye of doubtful mind for all these thing do the nation of the world seek after and your father knoweth that ye have need of these thing but rather seek ye the kingdom of god and all these thing shall be add unto you fear not little flock for it be your father good pleasure to give you the kingdom sell that ye have and give alms provide yourselves bag which wax not old treasure in the heaven that faileth not where no thief approacheth neither moth corrupteth for where your treasure be there will your heart be also let your loin be gird about and your light burning and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord when he will return from the wedding that when he cometh and knocketh they may open unto him immediately bless be those servant whom the lord when he cometh shall find watch verily say unto you that he shall gird himself and make them to sit down to meat and will come forth and serve them and if he shall come in the second watch or come in the third watch and find them so bless be those servant and this know that if the goodman of the house have know what hour the thief would come he would have watch and not have suffer his house to be broken through be ye therefore ready also for the son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not then peter say unto him lord speakest thou this parable unto u or even to all and the lord say who then be that faithful and wise steward whom his lord shall make ruler over his household to give them their portion of meat in due season bless be that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so do of truth say unto you that he will make him ruler over all that he hath but and if that servant say in his heart my lord delayeth his come and shall begin to beat the manservant and maiden and to eat and drink and to be drunken the lord of that servant will come in day when he looketh not for him and at an hour when he be not aware and will cut him in sunder and will appoint him his portion with the unbeliever and that servant which knew his lord will and prepared not himself neither do accord to his will shall be beaten with many stripe but he that knew not and do commit thing worthy of stripe shall be beaten with few stripe for unto whomsoever much be give of him shall be much require and to whom men have commit much of him they will ask the more be come to send fire on the earth and what will if it be already kindle but have baptism to be baptize with and how be straiten till it be accomplish suppose ye that be come to give peace on earth tell you nay but rather division for from henceforth there shall be five in one house divide three against two and two against three the father shall be divide against the son and the son against the father the mother against the daughter and the daughter against the mother the mother in law against her daughter in law and the daughter in law against her mother in law and he say also to the people when ye see cloud rise out of the west straightway ye say there cometh shower and so it be and when ye see the south wind blow ye say there will be heat and it cometh to pas ye hypocrite ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth but how be it that ye do not discern this time yea and why even of yourselves judge ye not what be right when thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate a thou art in the way give diligence that thou mayest be deliver from him l he hale thee to the judge and the judge deliver thee to the officer and the officer cast thee into prison tell thee thou shalt not depart thence till thou hast paid the very last mite there be present at that season some that told him of the galilaean whose blood pilate have mingle with their sacrifice and jesus answer say unto them suppose ye that these galilaean be sinner above all the galilaean because they suffer such thing tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish or those eighteen upon whom the tower in siloam fell and slew them think ye that they be sinner above all men that dwelt in jerusalem tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish he spake also this parable certain man have fig tree plant in his vineyard and he come and sought fruit thereon and found none then say he unto the dresser of his vineyard behold these three year come seek fruit on this fig tree and find none cut it down why cumbereth it the ground and he answer say unto him lord let it alone this year also till shall dig about it and dung it and if it bear fruit well and if not then after that thou shalt cut it down and he be teach in one of the synagogue on the sabbath and behold there be woman which have spirit of infirmity eighteen year and be bow together and could in no wise lift up herself and when jesus saw her he call her to him and say unto her woman thou art loose from thine infirmity and he laid his hand on her and immediately she be make straight and glorify god and the ruler of the synagogue answer with indignation because that jesus have heal on the sabbath day and say unto the people there be six day in which men ought to work in them therefore come and be heal and not on the sabbath day the lord then answer him and say thou hypocrite doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his as from the stall and lead him away to water and ought not this woman be daughter of abraham whom satan hath bound lo these eighteen year be loose from this bond on the sabbath day and when he have say these thing all his adversary be ashamed and all the people rejoice for all the glorious thing that be do by him then say he unto what be the kingdom of god like and whereunto shall resemble it it be like grain of mustard seed which man take and cast into his garden and it grow and waxed great tree and the fowl of the air lodge in the branch of it and again he say whereunto shall liken the kingdom of god it be like leaven which woman take and hid in three measure of meal till the whole be leaven and he go through the city and village teach and journeying toward jerusalem then say one unto him lord be there few that be save and he say unto them strive to enter in at the strait gate for many say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able when once the master of the house be risen up and hath shut to the door and ye begin to stand without and to knock at the door say lord lord open unto u and he shall answer and say unto you know you not whence ye be then shall ye begin to say we have eat and drunk in thy presence and thou hast taught in our street but he shall say tell you know you not whence ye be depart from me all ye worker of iniquity there shall be weep and gnash of teeth when ye shall see abraham and isaac and jacob and all the prophet in the kingdom of god and you yourselves thrust out and they shall come from the east and from the west and from the north and from the south and shall sit down in the kingdom of god and behold there be last which shall be first and there be first which shall be last the same day there come certain of the pharisee say unto him get thee out and depart hence for herod will kill thee and he say unto them go ye and tell that fox behold cast out devil and do cure to day and to morrow and the third day shall be perfect nevertheless must walk to day and to morrow and the day follow for it cannot be that prophet perish out of jerusalem jerusalem jerusalem which killest the prophet and stonest them that be sent unto thee how often would have gather thy child together a hen doth gather her brood under her wing and ye would not behold your house be left unto you desolate and verily say unto you ye shall not see me until the time come when ye shall say bless be he that cometh in the name of the lord and it come to pas a he go into the house of one of the chief pharisee to eat bread on the sabbath day that they watch him and behold there be certain man before him which have the dropsy and jesus answer spake unto the lawyer and pharisee say be it lawful to heal on the sabbath day and they held their peace and he take him and heal him and let him go and answer them say which of you shall have an as or an ox fall into pit and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day and they could not answer him again to these thing and he put forth parable to those which be bidden when he marked how they chose out the chief room say unto them when thou art bidden of any man to wedding sit not down in the high room l more honourable man than thou be bidden of him and he that bade thee and him come and say to thee give this man place and thou begin with shame to take the low room but when thou art bidden go and sit down in the low room that when he that bade thee cometh he may say unto thee friend go up high then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee for whosoever exalteth himself shall be abase and he that humbleth himself shall be exalt then say he also to him that bade him when thou makest dinner or supper call not thy friend nor thy brother neither thy kinsman nor thy rich neighbour l they also bid thee again and recompence be make thee but when thou makest feast call the poor the maim the lame the blind and thou shalt be bless for they cannot recompense thee for thou shalt be recompense at the resurrection of the just and when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these thing he say unto him bless be he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of god then say he unto him certain man make great supper and bade many and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that be bidden come for all thing be now ready and they all with one consent begin to make excuse the first say unto him have bought piece of ground and must need go and see it pray thee have me excuse and another say have bought five yoke of ox and go to prove them pray thee have me excuse and another say have married wife and therefore cannot come so that servant come and shew his lord these thing then the master of the house be angry say to his servant go out quickly into the street and lane of the city and bring in hither the poor and the maim and the halt and the blind and the servant say lord it be do a thou hast command and yet there be room and the lord say unto the servant go out into the highway and hedge and compel them to come in that my house may be fill for say unto you that none of those men which be bidden shall taste of my supper and there go great multitude with him and he turn and say unto them if any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and child and brother and sister yea and his own life also he cannot be my disciple and whosoever doth not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple for which of you intend to build tower sitteth not down first and counteth the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it l haply after he hath laid the foundation and be not able to finish it all that behold it begin to mock him say this man begin to build and be not able to finish or what king go to make war against another king sitteth not down first and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand or else while the other be yet great way off he sendeth an ambassage and desireth condition of peace so likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath he cannot be my disciple salt be good but if the salt have lose his savour wherewith shall it be season it be neither fit for the land nor yet for the dunghill but men cast it out he that hath ear to hear let him hear then drew near unto him all the publican and sinner for to hear him and the pharisee and scribe murmur say this man receiveth sinner and eateth with them and he spake this parable unto them say what man of you have an hundred sheep if he lose one of them doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which be lose until he find it and when he hath found it he layeth it on his shoulder rejoice and when he cometh home he calleth together his friend and neighbour say unto them rejoice with me for have found my sheep which be lose say unto you that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth more than over ninety and nine just person which need no repentance either what woman have ten piece of silver if she lose one piece doth not light candle and sweep the house and seek diligently till she find it and when she hath found it she calleth her friend and her neighbour together say rejoice with me for have found the piece which have lose likewise say unto you there be joy in the presence of the angel of god over one sinner that repenteth and he say certain man have two son and the young of them say to his father father give me the portion of good that falleth to me and he divide unto them his living and not many day after the young son gather all together and take his journey into far country and there waste his substance with riotous living and when he have spent all there arose mighty famine in that land and he begin to be in want and he go and join himself to citizen of that country and he sent him into his field to feed swine and he would fain have fill his belly with the husk that the swine do eat and no man give unto him and when he come to himself he say how many hire servant of my father have bread enough and to spare and perish with hunger will arise and go to my father and will say unto him father have sin against heaven and before thee and be no more worthy to be call thy son make me a one of thy hire servant and he arose and come to his father but when he be yet great way off his father saw him and have compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kiss him and the son say unto him father have sin against heaven and in thy sight and be no more worthy to be call thy son but the father say to his servant bring forth the best robe and put it on him and put ring on his hand and shoe on his foot and bring hither the fat calf and kill it and let u eat and be merry for this my son be dead and be alive again he be lose and be found and they begin to be merry now his elder son be in the field and a he come and drew nigh to the house he heard musick and dance and he call one of the servant and ask what these thing meant and he say unto him thy brother be come and thy father hath kill the fat calf because he hath receive him safe and sound and he be angry and would not go in therefore come his father out and intreated him and he answer say to his father lo these many year do serve thee neither transgress at any time thy commandment and yet thou never gavest me kid that might make merry with my friend but a soon a this thy son be come which hath devour thy living with harlot thou hast kill for him the fat calf and he say unto him son thou art ever with me and all that have be thine it be meet that we should make merry and be glad for this thy brother be dead and be alive again and be lose and be found and he say also unto his disciple there be certain rich man which have steward and the same be accuse unto him that he have waste his good and he call him and say unto him how be it that hear this of thee give an account of thy stewardship for thou mayest be no longer steward then the steward say within himself what shall do for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship cannot dig to beg be ashamed be resolve what to do that when be put out of the stewardship they may receive me into their house so he call every one of his lord debtor unto him and say unto the first how much owest thou unto my lord and he say an hundred measure of oil and he say unto him take thy bill and sit down quickly and write fifty then say he to another and how much owest thou and he say an hundred measure of wheat and he say unto him take thy bill and write fourscore and the lord commend the unjust steward because he have do wisely for the child of this world be in their generation wiser than the child of light and say unto you make to yourselves friend of the mammon of unrighteousness that when ye fail they may receive you into everlasting habitation he that be faithful in that which be least be faithful also in much and he that be unjust in the least be unjust also in much if therefore ye have not be faithful in the unrighteous mammon who will commit to your trust the true rich and if ye have not be faithful in that which be another man who shall give you that which be your own no servant can serve two master for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon and the pharisee also who be covetous heard all these thing and they deride him and he say unto them ye be they which justify yourselves before men but god knoweth your heart for that which be highly esteem among men be abomination in the sight of god the law and the prophet be until john since that time the kingdom of god be preach and every man presseth into it and it be easy for heaven and earth to pas than one tittle of the law to fail whosoever putteth away his wife and marrieth another committeth adultery and whosoever marrieth her that be put away from her husband committeth adultery there be certain rich man which be clothed in purple and fine linen and fare sumptuously every day and there be certain beggar name lazarus which be laid at his gate full of sore and desire to be fed with the crumb which fell from the rich man table moreover the dog come and lick his sore and it come to pas that the beggar die and be carry by the angel into abraham bosom the rich man also die and be bury and in hell he lift up his eye be in torment and seeth abraham afar off and lazarus in his bosom and he cry and say father abraham have mercy on me and send lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for be torment in this flame but abraham say son remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good thing and likewise lazarus evil thing but now he be comfort and thou art torment and beside all this between u and you there be great gulf fix so that they which would pas from hence to you cannot neither can they pas to u that would come from thence then he say pray thee therefore father that thou wouldest send him to my father house for have five brother that he may testify unto them l they also come into this place of torment abraham saith unto him they have moses and the prophet let them hear them and he say nay father abraham but if one go unto them from the dead they will repent and he say unto him if they hear not moses and the prophet neither will they be persuade though one rise from the dead then say he unto the disciple it be impossible but that offence will come but woe unto him through whom they come it be well for him that millstone be hang about his neck and he cast into the sea than that he should offend one of these little one take heed to yourselves if thy brother trespass against thee rebuke him and if he repent forgive him and if he trespass against thee seven time in day and seven time in day turn again to thee say repent thou shalt forgive him and the apostle say unto the lord increase our faith and the lord say if ye have faith a grain of mustard seed ye might say unto this sycamine tree be thou plucked up by the root and be thou plant in the sea and it should obey you but which of you have servant plow or feed cattle will say unto him by and by when he be come from the field go and sit down to meat and will not rather say unto him make ready wherewith may sup and gird thyself and serve me till have eat and drunken and afterward thou shalt eat and drink doth he thank that servant because he do the thing that be command him trow not so likewise ye when ye shall have do all those thing which be command you say we be unprofitable servant we have do that which be our duty to do and it come to pas a he go to jerusalem that he pass through the midst of samaria and galilee and a he enter into certain village there met him ten men that be leper which stood afar off and they lift up their voice and say jesus master have mercy on u and when he saw them he say unto them go

foot give him thanks and he be samaritan and jesus answer say be there not ten cleanse but where be the nine there be not found that return to give glory to god save this stranger and he say unto him arise go thy way thy faith hath make thee whole and when he be demand of the pharisee when the kingdom of god should come he answer them and say the kingdom of god cometh not with observation neither shall they say lo here or lo there for behold the kingdom of god be within you and he say unto the disciple the day will come when ye shall desire to see one of the day of the son of man and ye shall not see it and they shall say to you see here or see there go not after them nor follow them for a the lightning that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven shineth unto the other part under heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day but first must he suffer many thing and be reject of this generation and a it be in the day of noe so shall it be also in the day of the son of man they do eat they drank they married wife they be give in marriage until the day that noe enter into the ark and the flood come and destroyed them all likewise also a it be in the day of lot they do eat they drank they bought they sell they plant they build but the same day that lot go out of sodom it rain fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man be reveal in that day he which shall be upon the housetop and his stuff in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that be in the field let him likewise not return back remember lot wife whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed the one shall be take and the other shall be left two woman shall be grind together the one shall be take and the other left two men shall be in the field the one shall be take and the other left and they answer and say unto him where lord and he say unto them wheresoever the body be thither will the eagle be gather together and he spake parable unto them to this end that men ought always to pray and not to faint say there be in city judge which fear not god neither regard man and there be widow in that city and she come unto him say avenge me of mine adversary and he would not for while but afterward he say within himself though fear not god nor regard man yet because this widow troubleth me will avenge her l by her continual come she weary me and the lord say hear what the unjust judge saith and shall not god avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth and he spake this parable unto certain which trust in themselves that they be righteous and despise others two men go up into the temple to pray the one pharisee and the other publican the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself god thank thee that be not a other men be extortioner unjust adulterer or even a this publican fast twice in the week give tithe of all that posse and the publican stand afar off would not lift up so much a his eye unto heaven but smote upon his breast say god be merciful to me sinner tell you this man go down to his house justified rather than the other for every one that exalteth himself shall be abase and he that humbleth himself shall be exalt and they brought unto him also infant that he would touch them but when his disciple saw it they rebuke them but jesus call them unto him and say suffer little child to come unto me and forbid them not for of such be the kingdom of god verily say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god a little child shall in no wise enter therein and certain ruler ask him say good master what shall do to inherit eternal life and jesus say unto him why callest thou me good none be good save one that be god thou knowest the commandment do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness honour thy father and thy mother and he say all these have kept from my youth up now when jesus heard these thing he say unto him yet lackest thou one thing sell all that thou hast and distribute unto the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me and when he heard this he be very sorrowful for he be very rich and when jesus saw that he be very sorrowful he say how hardly shall they that have rich enter into the kingdom of god for it be easy for camel to go through needle eye than for rich man to enter into the kingdom of god and they that heard it say who then can be save and he say the thing which be impossible with men be possible with god then peter say lo we have left all and follow thee and he say unto them verily say unto you there be no man that hath left house or parent or brother or wife or child for the kingdom of god sake who shall not receive manifold more in this present time and in the world to come life everlasting then he take unto him the twelve and say unto them behold we go up to jerusalem and all thing that be write by the prophet concern the son of man shall be accomplish for he shall be deliver unto the gentile and shall be mocked and spitefully entreat and spit on and they shall scourge him and put him to death and the third day he shall rise again and they understood none of these thing and this say be hid from them neither knew they the thing which be spoken and it come to pas that a he be come nigh unto jericho certain blind man sat by the way side beg and hearing the multitude pas by he ask what it meant and they told him that jesus of nazareth passeth by and he cry say jesus thou son of david have mercy on me and they which go before rebuke him that he should hold his peace but he cry so much the more thou son of david have mercy on me and jesus stood and command him to be brought unto him and when he be come near he ask him say what wilt thou that shall do unto thee and he say lord that may receive my sight and jesus say unto him receive thy sight thy faith hath save thee and immediately he receive his sight and follow him glorify god and all the people when they saw it give praise unto god and jesus enter and pass through jericho and behold there be man name zacchaeus which be the chief among the publican and he be rich and he sought to see jesus who he be and could not for the press because he be little of stature and he ran before and climbed up into sycomore tree to see him for he be to pas that way and when jesus come to the place he look up and saw him and say unto him zacchaeus make haste and come down for to day must abide at thy house and he make haste and come down and receive him joyfully and when they saw it they all murmur say that he be go to be guest with man that be sinner and zacchaeus stood and say unto the lord behold lord the half of my good give to the poor and if have take any thing from any man by false accusation restore him fourfold and jesus say unto him this day be salvation come to this house forsomuch a he also be son of abraham for the son of man be come to seek and to save that which be lose and a they heard these thing he add and spake parable because he be nigh to jerusalem and because they thought that the kingdom of god should immediately appear he say therefore certain nobleman go into far country to receive for himself kingdom and to return and he call his ten servant and deliver them ten pound and say unto them occupy till come but his citizen hat him and sent message after him say we will not have this man to reign over u and it come to pas that when he be return have receive the kingdom then he command these servant to be call unto him to whom he have give the money that he might know how much every man have gain by trading then come the first say lord thy pound hath gain ten pound and he say unto him well thou good servant because thou hast be faithful in very little have thou authority over ten city and the second come say lord thy pound hath gain five pound and he say likewise to him be thou also over five city and another come say lord behold here be thy pound which have kept laid up in napkin for fear thee because thou art an austere man thou takest up that thou layedst not down and reapest that thou didst not sow and he saith unto him out of thine own mouth will judge thee thou wicked servant thou knewest that be an austere man take up that laid not down and reap that do not sow wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank that at my come might have require mine own with usury and he say unto them that stood by take from him the pound and give it to him that hath ten pound and they say unto him lord he hath ten pound for say unto you that unto every one which hath shall be give and from him that hath not even that he hath shall be take away from him but those mine enemy which would not that should reign over them bring hither and slay them before me and when he have thus spoken he go before ascend up to jerusalem and it come to pas when he be come nigh to bethphage and bethany at the mount call the mount of olive he sent two of his disciple say go ye into the village over against you in the which at your enter ye shall find colt tie whereon yet never man sat loose him and bring him hither and if any man ask you why do ye loose him thus shall ye say unto him because the lord hath need of him and they that be sent go their way and found even a he have say unto them and a they be loose the colt the owner thereof say unto them why loose ye the colt and they say the lord hath need of him and they brought him to jesus and they cast their garment upon the colt and they set jesus thereon and a he go they spread their clothes in the way and when he be come nigh even now at the descent of the mount of olive the whole multitude of the disciple begin to rejoice and praise god with loud voice for all the mighty work that they have see say bless be the king that cometh in the name of the lord peace in heaven and glory in the high and some of the pharisee from among the multitude say unto him master rebuke thy disciple and he answer and say unto them tell you that if these should hold their peace the stone would immediately cry out and when he be come near he beheld the city and wept over it say if thou hadst know even thou at least in this thy day the thing which belong unto thy peace but now they be hid from thine eye for the day shall come upon thee that thine enemy shall cast trench about thee and compass thee round and keep thee in on every side and shall lay thee even with the ground and thy child within thee and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation and he go into the temple and begin to cast out them that sell therein and them that bought say unto them it be write my house be the house of prayer but ye have make it den of thief and he taught daily in the temple but the chief priest and the scribe and the chief of the people sought to destroy him and could not find what they might do for all the people be very attentive to hear him and it come to pas that on one of those day a he taught the people in the temple and preach the gospel the chief priest and the scribe come upon him with the elder and spake unto him say tell u by what authority doest thou these thing or who be he that give thee this authority and he answer and say unto them will also ask you one thing and answer me the baptism of john be it from heaven or of men and they reason with themselves say if we shall say from heaven he will say why then believe ye him not but and if we say of men all the people will stone u for they be persuade that john be prophet and they answer that they could not tell whence it be and jesus say unto them neither tell you by what authority do these thing then begin he to speak to the people this parable certain man plant vineyard and let it forth to husbandman and go into far country for long time and at the season he sent servant to the husbandman that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard but the husbandman beat him and sent him away empty and again he sent another servant and they beat him also and entreat him shamefully and sent him away empty and again he sent third and they wound him also and cast him out then say the lord of the vineyard what shall do will send my beloved son it may be they will reverence him when they see him but when the husbandman saw him they reason among themselves say this be the heir come let u kill him that the inheritance may be ours so they cast him out of the vineyard and kill him what therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them he shall come and destroy these husbandman and shall give the vineyard to others and when they heard it they say god forbid and he beheld them and say what be this then that be write the stone which the builder reject the same be become the head of the corner whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder and the chief priest and the scribe the same hour sought to lay hand on him and they fear the people for they perceive that he have spoken this parable against them and they watch him and sent forth spy which should feign themselves just men that they might take hold of his word that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor and they ask him say master we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly neither acceptest thou the person of any but teachest the way of god truly be it lawful for u to give tribute unto caesar or no but he perceive their craftiness and say unto them why tempt ye me shew me penny whose image and superscription hath it they answer and say caesar and he say unto them render therefore unto caesar the thing which be caesar and unto god the thing which be god and they could not take hold of his word before the people and they marvel at his answer and held their peace then come to him certain of the sadducee which deny that there be any resurrection and they ask him say master moses write unto u if any man brother die have wife and he die without child that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother there be therefore seven brother and the first take wife and die without child and the second take her to wife and he die childless and the third take her and in like manner the seven also and they left no child and die last of all the woman die also therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them be she for seven have her to wife and jesus answer say unto them the child of this world marry and be give in marriage but they which shall be account worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor be give in marriage neither can they die any more for they be equal unto the angel and be the child of god be the child of the resurrection now that the dead be raise even moses shew at the bush when he calleth the lord the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob for he be not god of the dead but of the living for all live unto him then certain of the scribe answer say master thou hast well say and after that they durst not ask him any question at all and he say unto them how say they that christ be david son and david himself saith in the book of psalm the lord say unto my lord sit thou on my right hand till make thine enemy thy footstool david therefore calleth him lord how be he then his son then in the audience of all the people he say unto his disciple beware of the scribe which desire to walk in long robe and love greeting in the market and the high seat in the synagogue and the chief room at feast which devour widow house and for shew make long prayer the same shall receive great damnation and he look up and saw the rich men cast their gift into the treasury and he saw also certain poor widow cast in thither two mite and he say of truth say unto you that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all for all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offering of god but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she have and a some spake of the temple how it be adorn with goodly stone and gift he say a for these thing which ye behold the day will come in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and they ask him say master but when shall these thing be and what sign will there be when these thing shall come to pas and he say take heed that ye be not deceive for many shall come in my name say be christ and the time draweth near go ye not therefore after them but when ye shall hear of war and commotion be not terrify for these thing must first come to pas but the end be not by and by then say he unto them nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and great earthquake shall be in diver place and famine and pestilence and fearful sight and great sign shall there be from heaven but before all these they shall lay their hand on you and persecute you deliver you up to the synagogue and into prison be brought before king and ruler for my name sake and it shall turn to you for testimony settle it therefore in your heart not to meditate before what ye shall answer for will give you mouth and wisdom which all your adversary shall not be able to gainsay nor resist and ye shall be betrayed both by parent and brother and kinsfolk and friend and some of you shall they cause to be put to death and ye shall be hat of all men for my name sake but there shall not an hair of your head perish in your patience posse ye your soul and when ye shall see jerusalem compass with army then know that the desolation thereof be nigh then let them which be in judaea flee to the mountain and let them which be in the midst of it depart out and let not them that be in the country enter thereinto for these be the day of vengeance that all thing which be write may be fulfil but woe unto them that be with child and to them that give suck in those day for there shall be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be lead away captive into all nation and jerusalem shall be trodden down of the gentile until the time of the gentile be fulfil and there shall be sign in the sun and in the moon and in the star and upon the earth distress of nation with perplexity the sea and the wave roar men heart fail them for fear and for look after those thing which be come on the earth for the power of heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man come in cloud with power and great glory and when these thing begin to come to pas then look up and lift up your head for your redemption draweth nigh and he spake to them parable behold the fig tree and all the tree when they now shoot forth ye see and know of your own self that summer be now nigh at hand so likewise ye when ye see these thing come to pas know ye that the kingdom of god be nigh at hand verily say unto you this generation shall not pas away till all be fulfil heaven and earth shall pas away but my word shall not pas away and take heed to yourselves l at any time your heart be overcharge with surfeit and drunkenness and care of this life and so that day come upon you unawares for a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be account worthy to escape all these thing that shall come to pas and to stand before the son of man and in the day time he be teach in the temple and at night he go out and abode in the mount that be call the mount of olive and all the people come early in the morning to him in the temple for to hear him now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh which be call the passover and the chief priest and scribe sought how they might kill him for they fear the people then enter satan into juda surnamed iscariot be of the number of the twelve and he go his way and commune with the chief priest and captain how he might betray him unto them and they be glad and covenant to give him money and he promise and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude then come the day of unleavened bread when the passover must be kill and he sent peter and john say go and prepare u the passover that we may eat and they say unto him where wilt thou that we prepare and he say unto them behold when ye be enter into the city there shall man meet you bearing pitcher of water follow him into the house where he entereth in and ye shall say unto the goodman of the house the master saith unto thee where be the guestchamber where shall eat the passover with my disciple and he shall shew you large upper room furnish there make ready and they go and found a he have say unto them and they make ready the passover and when the hour be come he sat down and the twelve apostle with him and he say unto them with desire have desire to eat this passover with you before suffer for say unto you will not any more eat thereof until it be fulfil in the kingdom of god and he take the cup and give thanks and say take this and divide it among yourselves for say unto you will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of god shall come and he take bread and give thanks and brake it and give unto them say this be my body which be give for you this do in remembrance of me likewise also the cup after supper say this cup be the new testament in my blood which be shed for you but behold the hand of him that betrayeth me be with me on the table and truly the son of man goeth a it be determine but woe unto that man by whom he be betrayed and they begin to enquire among themselves which of them it be that should do this thing and there be also strife among them which of them should be account the great and he say unto them the king of the gentile exercise lordship over them and they that exercise authority upon them be call benefactor but ye shall not be so but he that be great among you let him be a the young and he that be chief a he that doth serve for whether be great he that sitteth at meat or he that serveth be not he that sitteth at meat but be among you a he that serveth ye be they which have continued with me in my temptation and appoint unto you kingdom a my father hath appoint unto me that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on throne judging the twelve tribe of israel and the lord say simon simon behold satan hath desire to have you that he may sift you a wheat but have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art convert strengthen thy brother and he say unto him lord be ready to go with thee both into prison and to death and he say tell thee peter the cock shall not crow this day before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me and he say unto them when sent you without purse and scrip and shoe lack ye any thing and they say nothing then say he unto them but now he that hath purse let him take it and likewise his scrip and he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one for say unto you that this that be write must yet be accomplish in me and he be reckon among the transgressor for the thing concern me have an end and they say lord behold here be two sword and he say unto them it be enough and he come out and go a he be wont to the mount of olive and his disciple also follow him and when he be at the place he say unto them pray that ye enter not into temptation

him from heaven strengthen him and be in an agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat be a it be great drop of blood fall down to the ground and when he rise up from prayer and be come to his disciple he found them sleep for sorrow and say unto them why sleep ye rise and pray l ye enter into temptation and while he yet spake behold multitude and he that be call juda one of the twelve go before them and drew near unto jesus to kiss him but jesus say unto him juda betrayest thou the son of man with kiss when they which be about him saw what would follow they say unto him lord shall we smite with the sword and one of them smote the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear and jesus answer and say suffer ye thus far and he touch his ear and heal him then jesus say unto the chief priest and captain of the temple and the elder which be come to him be ye come out a against thief with sword and stave when be daily with you in the temple ye stretch forth no hand against me but this be your hour and the power of darkness then take they him and lead him and brought him into the high priest house and peter follow afar off and when they have kindle fire in the midst of the hall and be set down together peter sat down among them but certain maid beheld him a he sat by the fire and earnestly look upon him and say this man be also with him and he deny him say woman know him not and after little while another saw him and say thou art also of them and peter say man be not and about the space of one hour after another confidently affirm say of truth this fellow also be with him for he be galilaean and peter say man know not what thou sayest and immediately while he yet spake the cock crew and the lord turn and look upon peter and peter remember the word of the lord how he have say unto him before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice and peter go out and wept bitterly and the men that held jesus mocked him and smote him and when they have blindfold him they struck him on the face and ask him say prophesy who be it that smote thee and many other thing blasphemously spake they against him and a soon a it be day the elder of the people and the chief priest and the scribe come together and lead him into their council say art thou the christ tell u and he say unto them if tell you ye will not believe and if also ask you ye will not answer me nor let me go hereafter shall the son of man sit on the right hand of the power of god then say they all art thou then the son of god and he say unto them ye say that be and they say what need we any far witness for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth and the whole multitude of them arose and lead him unto pilate and they begin to accuse him say we found this fellow pervert the nation and forbid to give tribute to caesar say that he himself be christ king and pilate ask him say art thou the king of the jew and he answer him and say thou sayest it then say pilate to the chief priest and to the people find no fault in this man and they be the more fierce say he stirreth up the people teach throughout all jewry begin from galilee to this place when pilate heard of galilee he ask whether the man be galilaean and a soon a he knew that he belong unto herod jurisdiction he sent him to herod who himself also be at jerusalem at that time and when herod saw jesus he be exceed glad for he be desirous to see him of long season because he have heard many thing of him and he hop to have see some miracle do by him then he question with him in many word but he answer him nothing and the chief priest and scribe stood and vehemently accuse him and herod with his men of war set him at nought and mocked him and arrayed him in gorgeous robe and sent him again to pilate and the same day pilate and herod be make friend together for before they be at enmity between themselves and pilate when he have call together the chief priest and the ruler and the people say unto them ye have brought this man unto me a one that perverteth the people and behold have examine him before you have found no fault in this man touch those thing whereof ye accuse him no nor yet herod for sent you

this man and release unto u barabbas who for certain sedition make in the city and for murder be cast into prison pilate therefore willing to release jesus spake again to them but they cry say crucify him crucify him and he say unto them the third time why what evil hath he do have found no cause of death in him will therefore chastise him and let him go and they be instant with loud voice require that he might be crucify and the voice of them and of the chief priest prevail and pilate give sentence that it should be a they require and he release unto them him that for sedition and murder be cast into prison whom they have desire but he deliver jesus to their will and a they lead him away they laid hold upon one simon cyrenian come out of the country and on him they laid the cross that he might bear it after jesus and there follow him great company of people and of woman which also bewail and lament him but jesus turn unto them say daughter of jerusalem weep not for me but weep for yourselves and for your child for behold the day be come in the which they shall say bless be the barren and the womb that never bare and the pap which never give suck then shall they begin to say to the mountain fall on u and to the hill cover u for if they do these thing in green tree what shall be do in the dry and there be also two other malefactor lead with him to be put to death and when they be come to the place which be call calvary there they crucify him and the malefactor one on the right hand and the other on the left then say jesus father forgive them for they know not what they

soldier also mocked him come to him and offering him vinegar and say if thou be the king of the jew save thyself and superscription also be write over him in letter of greek and latin and hebrew this

condemnation and we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our deed but this man hath do nothing amiss and he say unto jesus lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom and jesus say unto him verily say unto thee to day shalt thou be with me in paradise and it be about the sixth hour and there be darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour and the sun be darken and the veil of the temple be rent in the midst and when jesus have cry with loud voice he say father into thy hand commend my spirit and have say thus he give up the ghost now when the centurion saw what be do he glorify god say certainly this be righteous man and all the people that come together to that sight beholding the thing which be do smote their breast and return and all his acquaintance and the woman that follow him from galilee stood afar off beholding these thing and behold there be man name joseph counsellor and he be good man and just the same have not consent to the counsel and deed of them he be of arimathaea city of the jew who also himself wait for the kingdom of god this man go unto pilate and beg the body of jesus and he take it down and wrap it in linen and laid it in sepulchre

and how his body be laid and they return and prepared spice and ointment and rest the sabbath day accord to the commandment now upon the first day of the week very early in the morning they come unto the sepulchre bring the spice which they have prepared and certain others with them and they found the stone roll away from the sepulchre and they enter in and found not the body of the lord jesus and it come to pas a they be much perplexed thereabout behold two men stood by them in shin garment and a they be afraid and bow down their face to the earth they say unto them why seek ye the living among the dead he be not here but be risen remember how he spake unto you when he be yet in galilee say the son of man must be deliver into the hand of sinful men and be crucify and the third day rise again and they remember his word and return from the sepulchre and told all these thing unto the eleven and to all the rest it be mary magdalene and joanna and mary the mother of james and other woman that be with them which told these thing unto the apostle and their word seem to them a idle tale and they believe them not then arose peter and ran unto the sepulchre and stoop down he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves and depart wonder in himself at that which be come to pas and behold two of them go that same day to village call emmaus which be from jerusalem about threescore furlong and they talk together of all these thing which have happen and it come to pas that while they commune together and reason jesus himself drew near and go with them but their eye be holden that they should not know him and he say unto them what manner of communication be these that ye have one to another a ye walk and be sad and the one of them whose name be cleopas answer say unto him art thou only stranger in jerusalem and hast not know the thing which be come to pas there in these day and he say unto them what thing and they say unto him concern jesus of nazareth which be prophet

body they come say that they have also see vision of angel which say that he be alive and certain of them which be with u go to the sepulchre and found it even so a the woman have say but him they saw not then he say unto them fool and slow of heart to believe all that the prophet have spoken ought not christ to have suffer these thing and to enter into his glory and begin at moses and all the prophet he expound unto them in all the scripture the thing concern himself and they drew nigh unto the village whither they go and he make a though he would have go far but they constrain him say abide with u for it be toward even and the day be far spent and he go in to tarry with them and it come to pas a he sat at meat with them he take bread and bless it and brake and give to them and their eye be open and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they say one to another do not our heart burn within u while he talk with u by the way and while he open to u the scripture and they rise up the same hour and return to jerusalem and found the eleven gather together and them that be with them say the lord be risen indeed and hath appear to simon and they told what thing be do in the way and how he be know of them in break of bread and a they thus spake jesus himself stood in the midst of them and saith unto them peace be unto you but they be terrify and affright and suppose that they have see spirit and he say unto them why be ye troubled and why do thought arise in your heart behold my hand and my foot that it be myself handle me and see for spirit hath not flesh and bone a ye see me have and when he have thus spoken he shew them his hand and his foot and while they yet believe not for joy and wonder he say unto them have ye here any meat and they give him piece of broil fish and of an honeycomb and he take it and do eat before them and he say unto them these be the word which spake unto you while be yet with you that all thing must be fulfil which be write in the law of moses and in the prophet and in the psalm concern me then open he their understand that they might understand the scripture and say unto them thus it be write and thus it behove christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sin should be preach in his name among all nation begin at jerusalem and ye be witness of these thing and

say unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descend and remain on him the same be he which baptizeth with the holy ghost and saw and bare record that this be the son of god again the next day after john stood and two of his disciple and look upon jesus a he walk he saith behold the lamb of god and the two disciple heard him speak and they follow jesus then jesus turn and saw them follow and saith unto them what seek ye they say unto him rabbi which be to say be interpret master where dwellest thou he saith unto them come and see they come and saw where he dwelt and abode with him that day for it be about the tenth hour one of the two which heard john speak and follow him be andrew simon peter brother he first findeth his own brother simon and saith unto him we have found the

see jesus saw nathanael come to him and saith of him behold an israelite indeed in whom be no guile nathanael saith unto him whence knowest thou me jesus answer and say unto him before that philip call thee when thou wast under the fig tree saw thee nathanael answer and saith unto him rabbi thou art the son of god thou art the king of israel jesus answer and say unto him because say unto thee saw thee under the fig tree believest thou thou shalt see great thing than these and he saith unto him verily verily say unto you hereafter ye shall see heaven open and the angel of god ascend and descend upon the son of man and the third day there be marriage in cana of galilee and the mother of jesus be there and both jesus be call and his disciple to the marriage and when they want wine the mother of jesus saith unto him they have no wine jesus saith unto her woman what have to do with thee mine hour be not yet come his mother saith unto the servant whatsoever he saith unto you do it and there be set there six waterpots of stone after the manner of the purify of the jew contain two or three firkin apiece jesus saith unto them fill the waterpots with water and they fill them up to the brim and he saith unto them draw out now and bear unto the governor of the feast and they bare it when the ruler of the feast have taste the water that be make wine and knew not whence it be but the servant which drew the water knew the governor of the feast call the bridegroom and saith unto him every man at the begin doth set forth good wine and when men have well drunk then that which be bad but thou hast kept the good wine until now this begin of miracle do jesus in cana of galilee and manifest forth his glory and his disciple believe on him after this he go down to capernaum he and his mother and his brother and his disciple and they continued there not many day and the jew passover be at hand and jesus go up to jerusalem and found in the temple those that sell ox and sheep and dove and the changer of money sit and when he have make scourge of small cord he drove them all out of the temple and the sheep and the ox and pour out the changer money and overthrew the table and say unto them that sell dove take these thing hence make not my father house an house of merchandise and his disciple remember that it be write the zeal of thine house hath eat me up then answer the jew and say unto him what sign shewest thou unto u see that thou doest these thing jesus answer and say unto them destroy this temple and in three day will raise it up then say the jew forty and six year be this temple in building and wilt thou rear it up in three day but he spake of the temple of his body when therefore he be risen from the dead his disciple remember that he have say this unto them and they believe the scripture and the word which jesus have say now when he be in jerusalem at the passover in the feast day many believe in his name when they saw the miracle which he do but jesus do not commit himself unto them because he knew all men and need not that any should testify of man for he knew what be in man there be man of the pharisee name nicodemus ruler of the jew the same come to jesus by night and say unto him rabbi we know that thou art teacher come from god for no man can do these miracle that thou doest except god be with him jesus answer and say unto him verily verily say unto thee except man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god nicodemus saith unto him how can man be born when he be old can he enter the second time into his mother womb and be born jesus answer verily verily say unto thee except man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which be born of the flesh be flesh and that which be born of the spirit be spirit marvel not that say unto thee ye must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth so be every one that be born of the spirit nicodemus answer and say unto him how can these thing be jesus answer and say unto him art thou master of israel and knowest not these thing verily verily say unto thee we speak that we do know and testify that we have see and ye receive not our witness if have told you earthly thing and ye believe not how shall ye believe if tell you of heavenly thing and no man hath ascend up to heaven but he that come down from heaven even the son of man which be in heaven and a moses lift up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lift up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for god so love the world that he give his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be save he that believeth on him be not condemn but he that believeth not be condemn already because he hath not believe in the name of the only begotten son of god and this be the condemnation that light be come into the world and men love darkness rather than light because their deed be evil for every one that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light l his deed should be reprove but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deed may be make manifest that they be wrought in god after these thing come jesus and his disciple into the land of judaea and there he tarry with them and baptize and john also be baptizing in aenon near to salim because there be much water there and they come and be baptize for john be not yet cast into prison then there arose question between some of john disciple and the jew about purify and they come unto john and say unto him rabbi he that be with thee beyond jordan to whom thou barest witness behold the same baptizeth and all men come to him john answer and say man can receive nothing except it be give him from heaven ye yourselves bear me witness that say be not the christ but that be sent before him he that hath the bride be the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom voice this my joy therefore be fulfil he must increase but must decrease he that cometh from above be above all he that be of the earth be earthly and speaketh of the earth he that cometh from heaven be above all and what he hath see and heard that he testifieth and no man receiveth his testimony he that hath receive his testimony hath set to his seal that god be true for he whom god hath sent speaketh the word of god for god giveth not the spirit by measure unto him the father loveth the son and hath give all thing into his hand he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him when therefore the lord knew how the pharisee have heard that jesus make and baptize more disciple than john though jesus himself baptize not but his disciple he left judaea and depart again into galilee and he must need go through samaria then cometh he to city of samaria which be call sychar near to the parcel of ground that jacob give to his son joseph now jacob well be there jesus therefore be weary with his journey sat thus on the well and it be about the sixth hour there cometh woman of samaria to draw water jesus saith unto her give me to drink for his disciple be go away unto the city to buy meat then saith the woman of samaria unto him how be it that thou be jew askest drink of me which be woman of samaria for the jew have no dealing with the samaritan jesus answer and say unto her if thou knewest the gift of god and who it be that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldest have ask of him and he would have give thee living water the woman saith unto him sir thou hast nothing to draw with and the well be deep from whence then hast thou that living water art thou great than our father jacob which give u the well and drank thereof himself and his child and his cattle jesus answer and say unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that shall give him shall never thirst but the water that shall give him shall be in him well of water spring up into everlasting life the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that thirst not neither come hither to draw jesus saith unto her go call thy husband and come hither the woman answer and say have no husband jesus say unto her thou hast well say have no husband for thou hast have five husband and he whom thou now hast be not thy husband in that saidst thou truly the woman saith unto him sir perceive that thou art prophet our father worship in this mountain and ye say that in jerusalem be the place where men ought to worship jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation be of the jew but the hour cometh and now be when the true worshipper shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him god be spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth the woman saith unto him know that messias cometh which be call christ when he be come he will tell u all thing jesus saith unto her that speak unto thee be he and upon this come his disciple and marvel that he talk with the woman yet no man say what seekest thou or why talkest thou with her the woman then left her waterpot and go her way into the city and saith to the men come see man which told me all thing that ever do be not this the christ then they go out of the city and come unto him in the mean while his disciple prayed him say master eat but he say unto them have meat to eat that ye know not of therefore say the disciple one to another hath any man brought him ought to eat jesus saith unto them my meat be to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work say not ye there be yet four month and then cometh harvest behold say unto you lift up your eye and look on the field for they be white already to harvest and he that reapeth receiveth wage and gathereth fruit unto life eternal that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together and herein be that say true one soweth and another reapeth sent you to reap that whereon ye bestow no labour other men labour and ye be enter into their labour and many of the samaritan of that city believe on him for the say of the woman which testify he told me all that ever do so when the samaritan be come unto him they besought him that he would tarry with them and he abode there two day and many more believe because of his own word and say unto the woman now we believe not because of thy say for we have heard him ourselves and know that this be indeed the christ the saviour of the world now after two day he depart thence and go into galilee for jesus himself testify that prophet hath no honour in his own country then when he be come into galilee the galilaean receive him have see all the thing that he do at jerusalem at the feast for they also go unto the feast so jesus come again into cana of galilee where he make the water wine and there be certain nobleman whose son be sick at capernaum when he heard that jesus be come out of judaea into galilee he go unto him and besought him that he would come down and heal his son for he be at the point of death then say jesus unto him except ye see sign and wonder ye will not believe the nobleman saith unto him sir come down ere my child die jesus saith unto him go thy way thy son liveth and the man believe the word that jesus have spoken unto him and he go his way and a he be now go down his servant met him and told him say thy son liveth then enquire he of them the hour when he begin to amend and they say unto him yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him so the father knew that it be at the same hour in the which jesus say unto him thy son liveth and himself believe and his whole house this be again the second miracle that jesus do when he be come out of judaea into galilee after this there be feast of the jew and jesus go up to jerusalem now there be at jerusalem by the sheep market pool which be call in the hebrew tongue bethesda have five porch in these lay great multitude of impotent folk of blind halt wither wait for the move of the water for an angel go down at certain season into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then first after the trouble of the water step in be make whole of whatsoever disease he have and certain man be there which have an infirmity thirty and eight year when jesus saw him lie and knew that he have be now long time in that case he saith unto him wilt thou be make whole the impotent man answer him sir have no man when the water be troubled to put me into the pool but while be come another steppeth down before me jesus saith unto him rise take up thy bed and walk and immediately the man be make whole and take up his bed and walk and on the same day be the sabbath the jew therefore say unto him that be cure it be the sabbath day it be not lawful for thee to carry thy bed he answer them he that make me whole the same say unto me take up thy bed and walk then ask they him what man be that which say unto thee take up thy bed and walk and he that be heal wist not who it be for jesus have conveyed himself away multitude be in that place afterward jesus findeth him in the temple and say unto him behold thou art make whole sin no more l bad thing come unto thee the man depart and told the jew that it be jesus which have make him whole and therefore do the jew persecute jesus and sought to slay him because he have do these thing on the sabbath day but jesus answer them my father worketh hitherto and work therefore the jew sought the more to kill him because he not only have broken the sabbath but say also that god be his father make himself equal with god then answer jesus and say unto them verily verily say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what thing soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise for the father loveth the son and sheweth him all thing that himself doeth and he will shew him great work than these that ye may marvel for a the father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them even so the son quickeneth whom he will for the father judgeth no man but hath commit all judgment unto the son that all men should honour the son even a they honour the father he that honoureth not the son honoureth not the father which hath sent him verily verily say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but be pass from death unto life verily verily say unto you the hour be come and now be when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and they that hear shall live for a the father hath life in himself so hath he give to the son to have life in himself and hath give him authority to execute judgment also because he be the son of man marvel not at this for the hour be come in the which all that be in the graf shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have do good unto the resurrection of life and they that have do evil unto the resurrection of damnation can of mine own self do nothing a hear judge and my judgment be just because seek not mine own will but the will of the father which hath sent me if bear witness of myself my witness be not true there be another that beareth witness of me and know that the witness which he witnesseth of me be true ye sent unto john and he bare witness unto the truth but receive not testimony from man but these thing say that ye might be save he be burning and shin light and ye be willing for season to rejoice in his light but have great witness than that of john for the work which the father hath give me to finish the same work that do bear witness of me that the father hath sent me and the father himself which hath sent me hath borne witness of me ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor see his shape and ye have not his word abide in you for whom he hath sent him ye believe not search the scripture for in them ye think ye have eternal life and they be they which testify of me and ye will not come to me that ye might have life receive not honour from men but know you that ye have not the love of god in you be come in my father name and ye receive me not if another shall come in his own name him ye will receive how can ye believe which receive honour one of another and seek not the honour that cometh from god only do not think that will accuse you to the father there be one that accuseth you even moses in whom ye trust for have ye believe moses ye would have believe me for he write of me but if ye believe not his writing how shall ye believe my word after these thing jesus go over the sea of galilee which be the sea of tiberias and great multitude follow him because they saw his miracle which he do on them that be diseased and jesus go up into mountain and there he sat with his disciple and the passover feast of the jew be nigh when jesus then lift up his eye and saw great company come unto him he saith unto philip whence shall we buy bread that these may eat and this he say to prove him for he himself knew what he would do philip answer him two hundred pennyworth of bread be not sufficient for them that every one of them may take little one of his disciple andrew simon peter brother saith unto him there be lad here which hath five barley loaf and two small fish but what be they among so many and jesus say make the men sit down now there be much grass in the place so the men sat down in number about five thousand and jesus take the loaf and when he have give thanks he distribute to the disciple and the disciple to them that be set down and likewise of the fish a much a they would when they be fill he say unto his disciple gather up the fragment that remain that nothing be lose therefore they gather them together and fill twelve basket with the fragment of the five barley loaf which remain over and above unto them that have eat then those men when they have see the miracle that jesus do say this be of truth that prophet that should come into the world when jesus therefore perceive that they would come and take him by force to make him king he depart again into mountain himself alone and when even be now come his disciple go down unto the sea and enter into ship and go over the sea toward capernaum and it be now dark and jesus be not come to them and the sea arose by reason of great wind that blew so when they have rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlong they see jesus walk on the sea and draw nigh unto the ship and they be afraid but he saith unto them it be be not afraid then they willingly receive him into the ship and immediately the ship be at the land whither they go the day follow when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there be none other boat there save that one whereinto his disciple be enter and that jesus go not with his disciple into the boat but that his disciple be go away alone howbeit there come other boat from tiberias nigh unto the place where they do eat bread after that the lord have give thanks when the people therefore saw that jesus be not there neither his disciple they also take shipping and come to capernaum seek for jesus and when they have found him on the other side of the sea they say unto him rabbi when camest thou hither jesus answer them and say verily verily say unto you ye seek me not because ye saw the miracle but because ye do eat of the loaf and be fill labour not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath god the father seal then say they unto him what shall we do that we might work the work of god jesus answer and say unto them this be the work of god that ye believe on him whom he hath sent they say therefore unto him what sign shewest thou then that we may see and believe thee what dost thou work our father do eat manna in the desert a it be write he give them bread from heaven to eat then jesus say unto them verily verily say unto you moses give you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of god be he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world then say they unto him lord evermore give u this bread and jesus say unto them be the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst but say unto you that ye also have see me and believe not all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me will in no wise cast out for come down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me and this be the father will which hath sent me that of all which he hath give me should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day and this be the will of him that sent me that every one which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and will raise him up at the last day the jew then murmur at him because he say be the bread which come down from heaven and they say be not this jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother we know how be it then that he saith come down from heaven jesus therefore answer and say unto them murmur not among yourselves no man can come to me except the father which hath sent me draw him and will raise him up at the last day it be write in the prophet and they shall be all taught of god every man therefore that hath heard and hath learn of the father cometh unto me not that any man hath see the father save he which be of god he hath see the father verily verily say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life be that bread of life your father do eat manna in the wilderness and be dead this be the bread which cometh down from heaven that man may eat thereof and not die be the living bread which come down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever and the bread that will give be my flesh which will give for the life of the world the jew therefore strove among themselves say how can this man give u his flesh to eat then jesus say unto them verily verily say unto you except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and will raise him up at the last day for my flesh be meat indeed and my blood be drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and in him a the living father hath sent me and live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this be that bread which come down from heaven not a your father do eat manna and be dead he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever these thing say he in the synagogue a he taught in capernaum many therefore of his disciple when they have heard this say this be an hard say who can hear it when jesus knew in himself that his disciple murmur at it he say unto them doth this offend you what and if ye shall see the son of man ascend up where he be before it be the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the word that speak unto you they be spirit and they be life but there be some of you that believe not for jesus knew from the begin who they be that believe not and who should betray him and he say therefore say unto you that no man can come unto me except it be give unto him of my father from that time many of his disciple go back and walk no more with him then say jesus unto the twelve will ye also go away then simon peter answer him lord to whom shall we go thou hast the word of eternal life and we believe and be sure that thou art that christ the son of the living god jesus answer them have not chosen you twelve and one of you be devil he spake of juda iscariot the son of simon for he it be that should betray him be one of the twelve after these thing jesus walk in galilee for he would not walk in jewry because the jew sought to kill him now the jew feast of tabernacle be at hand his brother therefore say unto him depart hence and go into judaea that thy disciple also may see the work that thou doest for there be no man that doeth any thing in secret and he himself seeketh to be know openly if thou do these thing shew thyself to the world for neither do his brother believe in him then jesus say unto them my time be not yet come but your time be alway ready the world cannot hate you but me it hateth because testify of it that the work thereof be evil go ye up unto this feast go not up yet unto this feast for my time be not yet full come when he have say these word unto them he abode still in galilee but when his brother be go up then go he also up unto the feast not openly but a it be in secret then the jew sought him at the feast and say where be he and there be much murmur among the people concern him for some say he be good man others say nay but he deceiveth the people howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the jew now about the midst of the feast jesus go up into the temple and taught and the jew marvel say how knoweth this man letter have never learn jesus answer them and say my doctrine be not mine but his that sent me if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether speak of myself he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory but he that seeketh his glory that sent him the same be true and no unrighteousness be in him do not moses give you the law and yet none of you keepeth the law why go ye about to kill me the people answer and say thou hast devil who goeth about to kill thee jesus answer and say unto them have do one work and ye all marvel moses therefore give unto you circumcision not because it be of moses but of the father and ye on the sabbath day circumcise man if man on the sabbath day receive circumcision that the law of moses should not be broken be ye angry at me because have make man every whit whole on the sabbath day judge not accord to the appearance but judge righteous judgment then say some of them of jerusalem be not this he whom they seek to kill but lo he speaketh boldly and they say nothing unto him do the ruler know indeed that this be the very christ howbeit we know this man whence he be but when christ cometh no man knoweth whence he be then cry jesus in the temple a he taught say ye both know me and ye know whence be and be not come of myself but he that sent me be true whom ye know not but know him for be from him and he hath sent me then they sought to take him but no man laid hand on him because his hour be not yet come and many of the people believe on him and say when christ cometh will he do more miracle than these which this man hath do the pharisee heard that the people murmur such thing concern him and the pharisee and the chief priest sent officer to take him then say jesus unto them yet little while be with you and then go unto him that sent me ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where be thither ye cannot come then say the jew among themselves whither will he go that we shall not find him will he go unto the disperse among the gentile and teach the gentile what manner of say be this that he say ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where be thither ye cannot come in the last day that great day of the feast jesus stood and cry say if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me a the scripture hath say out of his belly shall flow river of living water but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the holy ghost be not yet give because that jesus be not yet glorify many of the people therefore when they heard this say say of truth this be the prophet others say this be the christ but some say shall christ come out of galilee hath not the scripture say that christ cometh of the seed of david and out of the town of bethlehem where david be so there be division among the people because of him and some of them would have take him but no man laid hand on him then come the officer to the chief priest and pharisee and they say unto them why have ye not brought him the officer answer never man spake like this man then answer them the pharisee be ye also deceive have any of the ruler or of the pharisee believe on him but this people who knoweth not the law be curse nicodemus saith unto them he that come to jesus by night be one of them doth our law judge any man before it hear him and know what he doeth they answer and say unto him art thou also of galilee search and look for out of galilee ariseth no prophet and every man go unto his own house jesus go unto the mount of olive and early in the morning he come again into the temple and all the people come unto him and he sat down and taught them and the scribe and pharisee brought unto him woman take in adultery and when they have set her in the midst they say unto him master this woman be take in adultery in the very act now moses in the law command u that such should be stone but what sayest thou this they say tempt him that they might have to accuse him but jesus stoop down and with his finger write on the ground a though he heard them not so when they continued ask him he lift up himself and say unto them he that be without sin among you let him first cast stone at her and again he stoop down and write on the ground and they which heard it be convict by their own conscience go out one by one begin at the eldest even unto the last and jesus be left alone and the woman stand in the midst when jesus have lift up himself and saw none but the woman he say unto her woman where be those thine accuser hath no man condemn thee she say no man lord and jesus say unto her neither do condemn thee go and sin no more then spake jesus again unto them say be the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life the pharisee therefore say unto him thou bearest record of thyself thy record be not true jesus answer and say unto them though bear record of myself yet my record be true for know whence come and whither go but ye cannot tell whence come and whither go ye judge after the flesh judge no man and yet if judge my judgment be true for be not alone but and the father that sent me it be also write in your law that the testimony of two men be true be one that bear witness of myself and the father that sent me beareth witness of me then say they unto him where be thy father jesus answer ye neither know me nor my father if ye have know me ye should have know my father also these word spake jesus in the treasury a he taught in the temple and no man laid hand on him for his hour be not yet come then say jesus again unto them go my way and ye shall seek me and shall die in your sin whither go ye cannot come then say the jew will he kill himself because he saith whither go ye cannot come and he say unto them ye be from beneath be from above ye be of this world be not of this world say therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sin for if ye believe not that be he ye shall die in your sin then say they unto him who art thou and jesus saith unto them even the same that say unto you from the begin have many thing to say and to judge of you but he that sent me be true and speak to the world those thing which have heard of him they understood not that he spake to them of the father then say jesus unto them when ye have lift up the son of man then shall ye know that be he and that do nothing of myself but a my father hath taught me speak these thing and he that sent me be with me the father hath not left me alone for do always those thing that please him a he spake these word many believe on him

speak that which have see with my father and ye do that which ye have see with your father they answer and say unto him abraham be our father jesus saith unto them if ye be abraham child ye would do the work of abraham but now ye seek to kill me man that hath told you the truth which have heard of god this do not abraham ye do the deed of your father then say they to him we be not born of fornication we have one father even god jesus say unto them if god be your father ye would love me for proceed forth and come from god neither come of myself but he sent me why do ye not understand my

him when he speaketh lie he speaketh of his own for he be liar and the father of it and because tell you the truth ye believe me not which of you convinceth me of sin and if say the truth why do ye not believe me he that be of god heareth god word ye therefore hear them not because ye be not of god then answer the jew and say unto him say we not well that thou art samaritan and hast devil jesus answer have not devil but honour my father and ye do dishonour me and seek not mine own glory there be one that seeketh and judgeth verily verily say unto you if man keep my say he shall never see death then say the jew unto him now we know that thou hast devil abraham be dead and the prophet and thou sayest if man keep my say he shall never taste of death art thou great than our father abraham which be dead and the prophet be dead whom makest thou thyself jesus answer if honour myself my honour be nothing it be my father that honoureth me of whom ye say that he be your god yet ye have not know him but know him and if should say know him not shall be liar like unto you but know him and keep his say your father abraham rejoice to see my day and he saw it and be glad then say the jew unto him thou art not yet fifty year old and hast thou see abraham jesus say unto them verily verily say unto you before abraham be be then take they up stone to cast at him but jesus hid himself and go out of the temple go through the midst of them and so pass by and a jesus pass by he saw man which be blind from his birth and his disciple ask him say master who do sin this man or his parent that he be born blind jesus answer neither hath this man sin nor his parent but that the work of god should be make manifest in him must work the work of him that sent me while it be day the night cometh when no man can work a long a be in the world be the light of the world when he have thus spoken he spat on the ground and make clay of the spittle and he anoint the eye of the blind man with the clay and say unto him go wash in the pool of siloam which be by interpretation sent he go his way therefore and wash and come see the neighbour therefore and they which before have see him that he be blind say be not this he that sat and beg some say this be he others say he be like him but he say be he therefore say they unto him how be thine eye open he answer and say man that be call jesus make clay and anoint mine eye and say unto me go to the pool of siloam and wash and go and wash and receive sight then say they unto him where be he he say know not they brought to the pharisee him that aforetime be blind and it be the sabbath day when jesus make the clay and open his eye then again the pharisee also ask him how he have receive his sight he say unto them he put clay upon mine eye and wash and do see therefore say some of the pharisee this man be not of god because he keepeth not the sabbath day others say how can man that be sinner do such miracle and there be division among them they say unto the blind man again what sayest thou of him that he hath open thine eye he say he be prophet but the jew do not believe concern him that he have be blind and receive his sight until they call the parent of him that have receive his sight and they ask them say be this your son who ye say be born blind how then doth he now see his parent answer them and say we know that this be our son and that he be born blind but by what mean he now seeth we know not or who hath open his eye we know not he be of age ask him he shall speak for himself these word spake his parent because they fear the jew for the jew have agree already that if any man do confess that he be christ he should be put out of the synagogue therefore say his parent he be of age ask him then again call they the man that be blind and say unto him give god the praise we know that this man be sinner he answer and say whether he be sinner or no know not one thing know that whereas be blind now see then say they to him again what do he to thee how open he thine eye he answer them have told you already and ye do not hear wherefore would ye hear it again will ye also be his disciple then they revile him and say thou art his disciple but we be moses disciple we know that god spake unto moses a for this fellow we know not from whence he be the man answer and say unto them why herein be marvellous thing that ye know not from whence he be and yet he hath open mine eye now we know that god heareth not sinner but if any man be worshipper of god and doeth his will him he heareth since the world begin be it not heard that any man open the eye of one that be born blind if this man be not of god he could do nothing they answer and say unto him thou wast altogether born in sin and dost thou teach u and they cast him out jesus heard that they have cast him out and when he have found him he say unto him dost thou believe on the son of god he answer and say who be he lord that might believe on him and jesus say unto him thou hast both see him and it be he that talketh with thee and he say lord believe and he worship him and jesus say for judgment be come into this world that they which see not might see and that they which see might be make blind and some of the pharisee which be with him heard these word and say unto him be we blind also jesus say unto them if ye be blind ye should have no sin but now ye say we see therefore your sin remaineth verily verily say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same be thief and robber but he that entereth in by the door be the shepherd of the sheep to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out and when he putteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice and stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of stranger this parable spake jesus unto them but they understood not what thing they be which he spake unto them then say jesus unto them again verily verily say unto you be the door of the sheep all that ever come before me be thief and robber but the sheep do not hear them be the door by me if any man enter in he shall be save and shall go in and out and find pasture the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy be come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly be the good shepherd the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep but he that be an hireling and not the shepherd whose own the sheep be not seeth the wolf come and leaveth the sheep and fleeth and the wolf catcheth them and scattereth the sheep the hireling fleeth because he be an hireling and careth not for the sheep be the good shepherd and know my sheep and be know of mine a the father knoweth me even so know the father and lay down my life for the sheep and other sheep have which be not of this fold them also must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one shepherd therefore doth my father love me because lay down my life that might take it again no man taketh it from me but lay it down of myself have power to lay it down and have power to take it again this commandment have receive of my father there be division therefore again among the jew for these saying and many of them say he hath devil and be mad why hear ye him others say these be not the word of him that hath devil can devil open the eye of the blind and it be at jerusalem the feast of the dedication and it be winter and jesus walk in the temple in solomon porch then come the jew round about him and say unto him how long dost thou make u to doubt if thou be the christ tell u plainly jesus answer them told you and ye believe not the work that do in my father name they bear witness of me but ye believe not because ye be not of my sheep a say unto you my sheep hear my voice and know them and they follow me and give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my father which give them me be great than all and no man be able to pluck them out of my father hand and my father be one then the jew take up stone again to stone him jesus answer them many good work have shew you from my father for which of those work do ye stone me the jew answer him say for good work we stone thee not but for blasphemy and because that thou be man makest thyself god jesus answer them be it not write in your law say ye be god if he call them god unto whom the word of god come and the scripture cannot be broken say ye of him whom the father hath sanctify and sent into the world thou blasphemest because say be the son of god if do not the work of my father believe me not but if do though ye believe not me believe the work that ye may know and believe that the father be in me and in him therefore they sought again to take him but he escape out of their hand and go away again beyond jordan into the place where john at first baptize and there he abode and many resort unto him and say john do no miracle but all thing that john spake of this man be true and many believe on him there now certain man be sick name lazarus of bethany the town of mary and her sister martha it be that mary which anoint the lord with ointment and wipe his foot with her hair whose brother lazarus be sick therefore his sister sent unto him say lord behold he whom thou lovest be sick when jesus heard that he say this sickness be not unto death but for the glory of god that the son of god might be glorify thereby now jesus love martha and her sister and lazarus when he have heard therefore that he be sick he abode two day still in the same place where he be then after that saith he to his disciple let u go into judaea again his disciple say unto him master the jew of late sought to stone thee and goest thou thither again jesus answer be there not twelve hour in the day if any man walk in the day he stumbleth not because he seeth the light of this world but if man walk in the night he stumbleth because there be no light in him these thing say he and after that he saith unto them our friend lazarus sleepeth but go that may awake him out of sleep then say his disciple lord if he sleep he shall do well howbeit jesus spake of his death but they thought that he have spoken of take of rest in sleep then say jesus unto them plainly lazarus be dead and be glad for your sake that be not there to the intent ye may believe nevertheless let u go unto him then say thomas which be call didymus unto his fellowdisciples let u also go that we may die with him then when jesus come he found that he have lain in the grave four day already now bethany be nigh unto jerusalem about fifteen furlong off and many of the jew come to martha and mary to comfort them concern their brother then martha a soon a she heard that jesus be come go and met him but mary sat still in the house then say martha unto jesus lord if thou hadst be here my brother have not die but know that even now whatsoever thou wilt ask of god god will give it thee jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again martha saith unto him know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day jesus say unto her be the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he be dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this she saith unto him yea lord believe that thou art the christ the son of god which should come into the world and when she have so say she go her way and call mary her sister secretly say the master be come and calleth for thee a soon a she heard that she arose quickly and come unto him now jesus be not yet come into the town but be in that place where martha met him the jew then which be with her in the house and comfort her when they saw mary that she rise up hastily and go out follow her say she goeth unto the grave to weep there then when mary be come where jesus be and saw him she fell down at his foot say unto him lord if thou hadst be here my brother have not die when jesus therefore saw her weep and the jew also weep which come with her he groan in the spirit and be troubled and say where have ye laid him they say unto him lord come and see jesus wept then say the jew behold how he love him and some of them say could not this man which open the eye of the blind have cause that even this man should not have die jesus therefore again groan in himself cometh to the grave it be cave and stone lay upon it jesus say take ye away the stone martha the sister of him that be dead saith unto him lord by this time he stinketh for he hath be dead four day jesus saith unto her say not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou shouldest see the glory of god then they take away the stone from the place where the dead be laid and jesus lift up his eye and say father thank thee that thou hast heard me and knew that thou hearest me always but because of the people which stand by say it that they may believe that thou hast sent me and when he thus have spoken he cry with loud voice lazarus come forth and he that be dead come forth bound hand and foot with graveclothes and his face be bound about with napkin jesus saith unto them loose him and let him go then many of the jew which come to mary and have see the thing which jesus do believe on him but some of them go their way to the pharisee and told them what thing jesus have do then gather the chief priest and the pharisee council and say what do we for this man doeth many miracle if we let him thus alone all men will believe on him and the roman shall come and take away both our place and nation and one of them name caiaphas be the high priest that same year say unto them ye know nothing at all nor consider that it be expedient for u that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation perish not and this spake he not of himself but be high priest that year he prophesy that jesus should die for that nation and not for that nation only but that also he should gather together in one the child of god that be scatter abroad then from that day forth they take counsel together for to put him to death jesus therefore walk no more openly among the jew but go thence unto country near to the wilderness into city call ephraim and there continued with his disciple and the jew passover be nigh at hand and many go out of the country up to jerusalem before the passover to purify themselves then sought they for jesus and spake among themselves a they stood in the temple what think ye that he will not come to the feast now both the chief priest and the pharisee have give commandment that if any man knew where he be he should shew it that they might take him then jesus six day before the passover come to bethany where lazarus be which have be dead whom he raise from the dead there they make him supper and martha serve but lazarus be one of them that sat at the table with him then take mary pound of ointment of spikenard very costly and anoint the foot of jesus and wipe his foot with her hair and the house be fill with the odour of the ointment then saith one of his disciple juda iscariot simon son which should betray him why be not this ointment sell for three hundred penny and give to the poor this he say not that he care for the poor but because he be thief and have the bag and bare what be put therein then say jesus let her alone against the day of my bury hath she kept this for the poor always ye have with you but me ye have not always much people of the jew therefore knew that he be there and they come not for jesus sake only but that they might see lazarus also whom he have raise from the dead but the chief priest consult that they might put lazarus also to death because that by reason of him many of the jew go away and believe on jesus on the next day much people that be come to the feast when they heard that jesus be come to jerusalem take branch of palm tree and go forth to meet him and cry hosanna bless be the king of israel that cometh in the name of the lord and jesus when he have found young as sat thereon a it be write fear not daughter of sion behold thy king cometh sit on an as colt these thing understood not his disciple at the first but when jesus be glorify then remember they that these thing be write of him and that they have do these thing unto him the people therefore that be with him when he call lazarus out of his grave and raise him from the dead bare record for this cause the people also met him for that they heard that he have do this miracle the pharisee therefore say among themselves perceive ye how ye prevail nothing behold the world be go after him and there be certain greek among them that come up to worship at the feast the same come therefore to philip which be of bethsaida of galilee and desire him say sir we would see jesus philip cometh and telleth andrew and again andrew and philip tell jesus and jesus answer them say the hour be come that the son of man should be glorify verily verily say unto you except corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal if any man serve me let him follow me and where be there shall also my servant be if any man serve me him will my father honour now be my soul troubled and what shall say father save me from this hour but for this cause come unto this hour father glorify thy name then come there voice from heaven say have both glorify it and will glorify it again the people therefore that stood by and heard it say that it thunder others say an angel spake to him jesus answer and say this voice come not because of me but for your sake now be the judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be cast out and if be lift up from the earth will draw all men unto me this he say signify what death he should die the people answer him we have heard out of the law that christ abideth for ever and how sayest thou the son of man must be lift up who be this son of man then jesus say unto them yet little while be the light with you walk while ye have the light l darkness come upon you for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth while ye have light believe in the light that ye may be the child of light these thing spake jesus and depart and do hide himself from them but though he have do so many miracle before them yet they believe not on him that the say of esaias the prophet might be fulfil which he spake lord who hath believe our report and to whom hath the arm of the lord be reveal therefore they could not believe because that esaias say again he hath blind their eye and harden their heart that they should not see with their eye nor understand with their heart and be convert and should heal them these thing say esaias when he saw his glory and spake of him nevertheless among the chief ruler also many believe on him but because of the pharisee they do not confess him l they should be put out of the synagogue for they love the praise of men more than the praise of god jesus cry and say he that believeth on me believeth not on me but on him that sent me and he that seeth me seeth him that sent me be come light into the world that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness and if any man hear my word and believe not judge him not for come not to judge the world but to save the world he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my word hath one that judgeth him the word that have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day for have not spoken of myself but the father which sent me he give me commandment what should say and what should speak and know that his commandment be life everlasting whatsoever speak therefore even a the father say unto me so speak now before the feast of the passover when jesus knew that his hour be come that he should depart out of this world unto the father have love his own which be in the world he love them unto the end and supper be end the devil have now put into the heart of juda iscariot simon son to betray him jesus know that the father have give all thing into his hand and that he be come from god and go to god he riseth from supper and laid aside his garment and take towel and gird himself after that he poureth water into bason and begin to wash the disciple foot and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he be gird then cometh he to simon peter and peter saith unto him lord dost thou wash my foot jesus answer and say unto him what do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter peter saith unto him thou shalt never wash my foot jesus answer him if wash thee not thou hast no part with me simon peter saith unto him lord not my foot only but also my hand and my head jesus saith to him he that be wash needeth not save to wash his foot but be clean every whit and ye be clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore say he ye be not all clean so after he have wash their foot and have take his garment and be set down again he say unto them know ye what have do to you ye call me master and lord and ye say well for so be if then your lord and master have wash your foot ye also ought to wash one another foot for have give you an example that ye should do a have do to you verily verily say unto you the servant be not great than his lord neither he that be sent great than he that sent him if ye know these thing happy be ye if ye do them speak not of you all know whom have chosen but that the scripture may be fulfil he that eateth bread with me hath lift up his heel against me now tell you before it come that when it be come to pas ye may believe that be he verily verily say unto you he that receiveth whomsoever send receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me when jesus have thus say he be troubled in spirit and testify and say verily verily say unto you that one of you shall betray me then the disciple look one on another doubt of whom he spake now there be lean on jesus bosom one of his disciple whom jesus love simon peter therefore beckon to him that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake he then lie on jesus breast saith unto him lord who be it jesus answer he it be to whom shall give sop when have dipped it and when he have dipped the sop he give it to juda iscariot the son of simon and after the sop satan enter into him then say jesus unto him that thou doest do quickly now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him for some of them thought because juda have the bag that jesus have say unto him buy those thing that we have need of against the feast or that he should give something to the poor he then have receive the sop go immediately out and it be night therefore when he be go out jesus say now be the son of man glorify and god be glorify in him if god be glorify in him god shall also glorify him in himself and shall straightway glorify him little child yet little while be with you ye shall seek me and a say unto the jew whither go ye cannot come so now say to you new commandment give unto you that ye love one another a have love you that ye also love one another by this shall all men know that ye be my disciple if ye have love one to another simon peter say unto him lord whither goest thou jesus answer him whither go thou canst not follow me now but thou shalt follow me afterwards peter say unto him lord why cannot follow thee now will lay down my life for thy sake jesus answer him wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake verily verily say unto thee the cock shall not crow till thou hast deny me thrice let not your heart be troubled ye believe in god believe also in me in my father house be many mansion if it be not so would have told you go to prepare place for you and if go and prepare place for you will come again and receive you unto myself that where be there ye may be also and whither go ye know and the way ye know thomas saith unto him lord we know not whither thou goest and how can we know the way jesus saith unto him be the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me if ye have know me ye should have know my father also and from henceforth ye know him and have see him philip saith unto him lord shew u the father and it sufficeth u jesus saith unto him have be so long time with you and yet hast thou not know me philip he that hath see me hath see the father and how sayest thou then shew u the father believest thou not that be in the father and the father in me the word that speak unto you speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the work believe me that be in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work sake verily verily say unto you he that believeth on me the work that do shall he do also and great work than these shall he do because go unto my father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will do that the father may be glorify in the son if ye shall ask any thing in my name will do it if ye love me keep my commandment and will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you for ever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you will not leave you comfortless will come to you yet little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because live ye shall live also at that day ye shall know that be in my father and ye in me and in you he that hath my commandment and keepeth them he it be that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be love of my father and will love him and will manifest myself to him juda saith unto him not iscariot lord how be it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto u and not unto the world jesus answer and say unto him if man love me he will keep my word and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him he that loveth me not keepeth not my saying and the word which ye hear be not mine but the father which sent me these thing have spoken unto you be yet present with you but the comforter which be the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all thing and bring all thing to your remembrance whatsoever have say unto you peace leave with you my peace give unto you not a the world giveth give unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid ye have heard how say unto you go away and come again unto you if ye love me ye would rejoice because say go unto the father for my father be great than and now have told you before it come to pas that when it be come to pas ye might believe hereafter will not talk much with you for the prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me but that the world may know that love the father and a the father give me commandment even so do arise let u go hence be the true vine and my father be the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit now ye be clean through the word which have spoken unto you abide in me and in you a the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me be the vine ye be the branch he that abideth in me and in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing if man abide not in me he be cast forth a branch and be wither and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they be burn if ye abide in me and my word abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be do unto you herein be my father glorify that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciple a the father hath

make know unto you ye have not chosen me but have chosen you and ordain you that ye should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may give it you these thing command you that ye love one another if the world hate you ye know that it hat me before it hat you if ye be of the world the world would love his own but because ye be not of the world but have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hateth you remember the word that say unto you the servant be not great than his lord if they have persecute me they will also persecute you if they have kept my say they will keep yours also but all these thing will they do unto you for my name sake because they know not him that sent me if have not come and spoken unto them they have not have sin but now they have no cloak for their sin he that hateth me hateth my father also if have not do among them the work which none other man do they have not have sin but now have they both see and hat both me and my father but this cometh to pas that the word might be fulfil that be write in their law they hat me without cause but when the comforter be come whom will send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me and ye also shall bear witness because ye have be with me from the begin these thing have spoken unto you that ye should not be offend they shall put you out of the synagogue yea the time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth god service and these thing will they do unto you because they have not know the father nor me but these thing have told you that when the time shall come ye may remember that told you of them and these thing say not unto you at the begin because be with you but now go my way to him that sent me and none of you asketh me whither goest thou but because have say these thing unto you sorrow hath fill your heart nevertheless tell you the truth it be expedient for you that go away for if go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if depart will send him unto you and when he be come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment of sin because they believe not on me of righteousness because go to my father and ye see me no more of judgment because the prince of this world be judged have yet many thing to say unto you but ye cannot bear them now howbeit when he the spirit of truth be come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall

and shall shew it unto you little while and ye shall not see me and again little while and ye shall see me because go to the father then say some of his disciple among themselves what be this that he saith unto u little while and ye shall not see me and again little while and ye shall see me and because go to the father they say therefore what be this that he saith little while we cannot tell what he saith now jesus knew that they be desirous to ask him and say unto them do ye enquire among yourselves of that say little while and ye shall not see me and again little while and ye shall see me verily verily say unto you that ye shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turn into joy woman when she be in travail hath sorrow because

have ye ask nothing in my name ask and ye shall receive that your joy may be full these thing have spoken unto you in proverb but the time cometh when shall no more speak unto you in proverb but shall shew you plainly of the father at that day ye shall ask in my name and say not unto you that will pray the father for you for the father himself loveth you because ye have love me and have believe that come out from god come forth from the father and be come into the world again leave the world and go to the father his disciple say unto him lo now speakest thou plainly and speakest no proverb now be we sure that thou knowest all thing and needest not that any man should ask thee by this we believe that thou camest forth from god jesus answer them do ye now believe behold the hour cometh yea be now come that ye shall be scatter every man to his own and shall leave me alone and yet be not alone because the father be with me these thing have spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer have overcome the world these word spake jesus and lift up his eye to heaven and say father the hour be come glorify thy son that thy

runneth and cometh to simon peter and to the other disciple whom jesus love and saith unto them they have take away the lord out of the sepulchre and we know not where they have laid him peter therefore go forth and that other disciple and come to the sepulchre so they ran both together and the other disciple do outrun peter and come first to the sepulchre and he stoop down and look in saw the linen clothes lie yet go he not in then cometh simon peter follow him and go into the sepulchre and seeth the linen clothes lie and the napkin that be about his head not lie with the linen clothes but wrap together in place by itself then go in also that other disciple which come first to the sepulchre and he saw and believe for a yet they knew not the scripture that he must rise again from the

this wise shew he himself there be together simon peter and thomas call didymus and nathanael of cana in galilee and the son of zebedee and two other of his disciple simon peter saith unto them go

disciple knew not that it be jesus then jesus saith unto them child have ye any meat they answer him no and he say unto them cast the net on the right side of the ship and ye shall find they cast therefore and now they be not able to draw it for the multitude of fish therefore that disciple whom jesus love saith unto peter it be the lord now when simon peter heard that it be the lord he girt his fisher coat unto him for he be naked and do cast himself into the sea and the other disciple come in little ship for they be not far from land but a it be two hundred cubit drag the net with fish

know that it be the lord jesus then cometh and taketh bread and giveth them and fish likewise this be now the third time that jesus shew himself to his disciple after that he be risen from the dead so when they have din jesus saith to simon peter simon son of jonas lovest thou me more than these he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that love thee he saith unto him feed my lamb he saith to him again the second time simon son of jonas lovest thou me he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that love thee he saith unto him feed my sheep he saith unto him the third time simon son of jonas

verily verily say unto thee when thou wast young thou girdest thyself and walkedst whither thou wouldest but when thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hand and another shall gird thee and carry thee whither thou wouldest not this spake he signify by what death he should glorify god and when he have spoken this he saith unto him follow me then peter turn about seeth the disciple whom jesus love follow which also lean on his breast at supper and say lord which be he that betrayeth thee peter see him saith to jesus lord and what shall this man do jesus saith unto him if will that he tarry till come what be that to thee follow thou me then go this say abroad among the brother that that disciple should not die yet jesus say not unto him he shall not die but if will that he tarry till come what be that to thee this be the disciple which testifieth of these thing and write these thing and we know that his testimony be true and there be also many other thing which jesus do the which if they should be write every one suppose that even the world itself could not contain the book that should be write amen book act the former treatise have make theophilus of all that jesus begin both to do and teach until the day in which he be take up after that he through the holy ghost have give commandment unto the apostle whom he have chosen to whom also he shew himself alive after his passion by many infallible proof be see of them forty day and speak of the thing pertain to the kingdom of god and be assemble together with them command them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me for john truly baptize with water but ye shall be baptize with the holy ghost not many day hence when they therefore be come together they ask of him say lord wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel and he say unto them it be not for you to know the time or the season which the father hath put in his own power but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost be come upon you and ye shall be witness unto me both in jerusalem and in all judaea and in samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth and when he have spoken these thing while they beheld he be take up and cloud receive him out of their sight and while they look stedfastly toward heaven a he go up behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also say ye men of galilee why stand ye gaze up into heaven this same jesus which be take up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner a ye have see him go into heaven then return they unto jerusalem from the mount call olivet which be from jerusalem sabbath day journey and when they be come in they go up into an upper room where abode both peter and james and john and andrew philip and thomas bartholomew and matthew james the son of alphaeus and simon zelotes and juda the brother of james these all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication with the woman and mary the mother of jesus and with his brother and in those day peter stood up in the midst of the disciple and say the number of name together be about an hundred and twenty men and brother this scripture must need have be fulfil which the holy ghost by the mouth of david spake before concern juda which be guide to them that take jesus for he be numbered with u and have obtain part of this ministry now this man purchase field with the reward of iniquity and fall headlong he burst asunder in the midst and all his bowel gush out and it be know unto all the dweller at jerusalem insomuch a that field be call in their proper tongue aceldama that be to say the field of blood for it be write in the book of psalm let his habitation be desolate and let no man dwell therein and his bishoprick let another take wherefore of these men which have companied with u all the time that the lord jesus go in and out among u begin from the baptism of john unto that same day that he be take up from u must one be ordain to be witness with u of his resurrection and they appoint two joseph call barsabas who be surnamed justus and matthias and they prayed and say thou lord which knowest the heart of all men shew whether of these two thou hast chosen that he may take part of this ministry and apostleship from which juda by transgression fell that he might go to his own place and they give forth their lot and the lot fell upon matthias and he be numbered with the eleven apostle and when the day of pentecost be fully come they be all with one accord in one place and suddenly there come sound from heaven a of rush mighty wind and it fill all the house where they be sit and there appear unto them cloven tongue like a of fire and it sat upon each of them and they be all fill with the holy ghost and begin to speak with other tongue a the spirit give them utterance and there be dwell at jerusalem jew devout men out of every nation under heaven now when this be noise abroad the multitude come together and be confound because that every man heard them speak in his own language and they be all amaze and marvel say one to another behold be not all these which speak galilaean and how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we be born parthian and medes and elamite and the dweller in mesopotamia and in judaea and cappadocia in pontus and asia phrygia and pamphylia in egypt and in the part of libya about cyrene and stranger of rome jew and proselyte crete and arabian we do hear them speak in our tongue the wonderful work of god and they be all amaze and be in doubt say one to another what meaneth this others mock say these men be full of new wine but peter stand up with the eleven lift up his voice and say unto them ye men of judaea and all ye that dwell at jerusalem be this know unto you and hearken to my word for these be not drunken a ye suppose see it be but the third hour of the day but this be that which be spoken by the prophet joel and it shall come to pas in the last day saith god will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your son and your daughter shall prophesy and your young men shall see vision and your old men shall dream dream and on my servant and on my handmaiden will pour out in those day of my spirit and they shall prophesy and will shew wonder in heaven above and sign in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapour of smoke the sun shall be turn into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and notable day of the lord come and it shall come to pas that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be save ye men of israel hear these word jesus of nazareth man approve of god among you by miracle and wonder and sign which god do by him in the midst of you a ye yourselves also know him be deliver by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of god ye have take and by wicked hand have crucify and slain whom god hath raise up have loose the pain of death because it be not possible that he should be holden of it for david speaketh concern him foresaw the lord always before my face for he be on my right hand that should not be move therefore do my heart rejoice and my tongue be glad moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption thou hast make know to me the way of life thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance men and brother let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch david that he be both dead and bury and his sepulchre be with u unto this day therefore be prophet and know that god have sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loin accord to the flesh he would raise up christ to sit on his throne he see this before spake of the resurrection of christ that his soul be not left in hell neither his flesh do see corruption this jesus hath god raise up whereof we all be witness therefore be by the right hand of god exalt and have receive of the father the promise of the holy ghost he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear for david be not ascend into the heaven but he saith himself the lord say unto my lord sit thou on my right hand until make thy foe thy footstool therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath make the same jesus whom ye have crucify both lord and christ now when they heard this they be pricked in their heart and say unto peter and to the rest of the apostle men and brother what shall we do then peter say unto them repent and be baptize every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise be unto you and to your child and to all that be afar off even a many a the lord our god shall call and with many other word do he testify and exhort say save yourselves from this untoward generation then they that gladly receive his word be baptize and the same day there be add unto them about three thousand soul and they continued stedfastly in the apostle doctrine and fellowship and in break of bread and in prayer and fear come upon every soul and many wonder and sign be do by the apostle and all that believe be together and have all thing common and sell their possession and good and part them to all men a every man have need and they continue daily with one accord in the temple and break bread from house to house do eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart praise god and have favour with all the people and the lord add to the church daily such a should be save now peter and john go up together into the temple at the hour of prayer be the ninth hour and certain man lame from his mother womb be carry whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which be call beautiful to ask alms of them that enter into the temple who see peter and john about to go into the temple ask an alms and peter fasten his eye upon him with john say look on u and he give heed unto them expect to receive something of them then peter say silver and gold have none but such a have give thee in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk and he take him by the right hand and lift him up and immediately his foot and ankle bone receive strength and he leap up stood and walk and enter with them into the temple walk and leap and praise god and all the people saw him walk and praise god and they knew that it be he which sat for alms at the beautiful gate of the temple and they be fill with wonder and amazement at that which have happen unto him and a the lame man which be heal held peter and john all the people ran together unto them in the porch that be call solomon greatly wonder and when peter saw it he answer unto the people ye men of israel why marvel ye at this or why look ye so earnestly on u a though by our own power or holiness we have make this man to walk the god of abraham and of isaac and of jacob the god of our father hath glorify his son jesus whom ye deliver up and deny him in the presence of pilate when he be determine to let him go but ye deny the holy one and the just and desire murderer to be grant unto you and kill the prince of life whom god hath raise from the dead whereof we be witness and his name through faith in his name hath make this man strong whom ye see and know yea the faith which be by him hath give him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all and now brother wot that through ignorance ye do it a do also your ruler but those thing which god before have shew by the mouth of all his prophet that christ should suffer he hath so fulfil repent ye therefore and be convert that your sin may be blot out when the time of refresh shall come from the presence of the lord and he shall send jesus christ which before be preach unto you whom the heaven must receive until the time of restitution of all thing which god hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophet since the world begin for moses truly say unto the father prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brother like unto me him shall ye hear in all thing whatsoever he shall say unto you and it shall come to pas that every soul which will not hear that prophet shall be destroyed from among the people yea and all the prophet from samuel and those that follow after a many a have spoken have likewise foretold of these day ye be the child of the prophet and of the covenant which god make with our father say unto abraham and in thy seed shall all the kindred of the earth be bless unto you first god have raise up his son jesus sent him to bless you in turn away every one of you from his iniquity and a they spake unto the people the priest and the captain of the temple and the sadducee come upon them be grieve that they taught the people and preach through jesus the resurrection from the dead and they laid hand on them and put them in hold unto the next day for it be now eventide howbeit many of them which heard the word believe and the number of the men be about five thousand and it come to pas on the morrow that their ruler and elder and scribe and anna the high priest and caiaphas and john and alexander and a many a be of the kindred of the high priest be gather together at jerusalem and when they have set them in the midst they ask by what power or by what name have ye do this then peter fill with the holy ghost say unto them ye ruler of the people and elder of israel if we this day be examine of the good deed do to the impotent man by what mean he be make whole be it know unto you all and to all the people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom ye crucify whom god raise from the dead even by him doth this man stand here before you whole this be the stone which be set at nought of you builder which be become the head of the corner neither be there salvation in any other for there be none other name under heaven give among men whereby we must be save now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and perceive that they be unlearned and ignorant men they marvel and they take knowledge of them that they have be with jesus and beholding the man which be heal stand with them they could say nothing against it but when they have command them to go aside out of the council they confer among themselves say what shall we do to these men for that indeed notable miracle hath be do by them be manifest to all them that dwell in jerusalem and we cannot deny it but that it spread no far among the people let u straitly threaten them that they speak henceforth to no man in this name and they call them and command them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesus but peter and john answer and say unto them whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god judge ye for we cannot but speak the thing which we have see and heard so when they have far threaten them they let them go find nothing how they might punish them because of the people for all men glorify god for that which be do for the man be above forty year old on whom this miracle of heal be shew and be let go they go to their own company and report all that the chief priest and elder have say unto them and when they heard that they lift up their voice to god with one accord and say lord thou art god which hast make heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them be who by the mouth of thy servant david hast say why do the heathen rage and the people imagine vain thing the king of the earth stood up and the ruler be gather together against the lord and against his christ for of truth against thy holy child jesus whom thou hast anoint both herod and pontius pilate with the gentile and the people of israel be gather together for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determine before to be do and now lord behold their threatenings and grant unto thy servant that with all boldness they may speak thy word by stretch forth thine hand to heal and that sign and wonder may be do by the name of thy holy child jesus and when they have prayed the place be shaken where they be assemble together and they be all fill with the holy ghost and they spake the word of god with boldness and the multitude of them that believe be of one heart and of one soul neither say any of them that ought of the thing which he possess be his own but they have all thing common and with great power give the apostle witness of the resurrection of the lord jesus and great grace be upon them all neither be there any among them that lack for a many a be possessor of land or house sell them and brought the price of the thing that be sell and laid them down at the apostle foot and distribution be make unto every man accord a he have need and joses who by the apostle be surnamed barnabas which be be interpret the son of consolation levite and of the country of cyprus have land sell it and brought the money and laid it at the apostle foot but certain man name ananias with sapphira his wife sell possession and kept back part of the price his wife also be privy to it and brought certain part and laid it at the apostle foot but peter say ananias why hath satan fill thine heart to lie to the holy ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land while it remain be it not thine own and after it be sell be it not in thine own power why hast thou conceive this thing in thine heart thou hast not lie unto men but unto god and ananias hearing these word fell down and give up the ghost and great fear come on all them that heard these thing and the young men arose wound him up and carry him out and bury him and it be about the space of three hour after when his wife not know what be do come in and peter answer unto her tell me whether ye sell the land for so much and she say yea for so much then peter say unto her how be it that ye have agree together to tempt the spirit of the lord behold the foot of them which have bury thy husband be at the door and shall carry thee out then fell she down straightway at his foot and yield up the ghost and the young men come in and found her dead and carry her forth bury her by her husband and great fear come upon all the church and upon a many a heard these thing and by the hand of the apostle be many sign and wonder wrought among the people and they be all with one accord in solomon porch and of the rest durst no man join himself to them but the people magnify them and believer be the more add to the lord multitude both of men and woman insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the street and laid them on bed and couch that at the least the shadow of peter passing by might overshadow some of them there come also multitude out of the city round about unto jerusalem bring sick folk and them which be vexed with unclean spirit and they be heal every one then the high priest rise up and all they that be with him which be the sect of the sadducee and be fill with indignation and laid their hand on the apostle and put them in the common prison but the angel of the lord by night open the prison door and brought them forth and say go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the word of this life and when they heard that they enter into the temple early in the morning and taught but the high priest come and they that be with him and call the council together and all the senate of the child of israel and sent to the prison to have them brought but when the officer come and found them not in the prison they return and told say the prison truly found we shut with all safety and the keeper stand without before the door but when we have open we found no man within now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priest heard these thing they doubt of them whereunto this would grow then come one and told them say behold the men whom ye put in prison be stand in the temple and teach the people then go the captain with the officer and brought them without violence for they fear the people l they should have be stone and when they have brought them they set them before the council and the high priest ask them say do not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name and behold ye have fill jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this man blood upon u then peter and the other apostle answer and say we ought to obey god rather than men the god of our father raise up jesus whom ye slew and hang on tree him hath god exalt with his right hand to be prince and saviour for to give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sin and we be his witness of these thing and so be also the holy ghost whom god hath give to them that obey him when they heard that they be cut to the heart and take counsel to slay them then stood there up one in the council pharisee name gamaliel doctor of the law have in reputation among all the people and command to put the apostle forth little space and say unto them ye men of israel take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do a touch these men for before these day rise up theudas boasting himself to be somebody to whom number of men about four hundred join themselves who be slain and all a many a obeyed him be scatter and brought to nought after this man rise up juda of galilee in the day of the tax and drew away much people after him he also perish and all even a many a obeyed him be disperse and now say unto you refrain from these men and let them alone for if this counsel or this work be of men it will come to nought but if it be of god ye cannot overthrow it l haply ye be found even to fight against god and to him they agree and when they have call the apostle and beaten them they command that they should not speak in the name of jesus and let them go and they depart from the presence of the council rejoice that they be count worthy to suffer shame for his name and daily in the temple and in every house they cease not to teach and preach jesus christ and in those day when the number of the disciple be multiply there arose murmur of the grecian against the hebrew because their widow be neglect in the daily ministration then the twelve call the multitude of the disciple unto them and say it be not reason that we should leave the word of god and serve table wherefore brother look ye out among you seven men of honest report full of the holy ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint over this business but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word and the say pleased the whole multitude and they chose stephen man full of faith and of the holy ghost and philip and prochorus and nicanor and timon and parmenas and nicolas proselyte of antioch whom they set before the apostle and when they have prayed they laid their hand on them and the word of god increase and the number of the disciple multiply in jerusalem greatly and great company of the priest be obedient to the faith and stephen full of faith and power do great wonder and miracle among the people then there arose certain of the synagogue which be call the synagogue of the libertine and cyrenians and alexandrian and of them of cilicia and of asia dispute with stephen and they be not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake then they suborn men which say we have heard him speak blasphemous word against moses and against god and they stir up the people and the elder and the scribe and come upon him and caught him and brought him to the council and set up false witness which say this man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous word against this holy place and the law for we have heard him say that this jesus of nazareth shall destroy this place and shall change the custom which moses deliver u and all that sat in the council look stedfastly on him saw his face a it have be the face of an angel then say the high priest be these thing so and he say men brother and father hearken the god of glory appear unto our father abraham when he be in mesopotamia before he dwelt in charran and say unto him get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and come into the land which shall shew thee then come he out of the land of the chaldaean and dwelt in charran and from thence when his father be dead he remove him into this land wherein ye now dwell and he give him none inheritance in it no not so much a to set his foot on yet he promise that he would give it to him for possession and to his seed after him when a yet he have no child and god spake on this wise that his seed should sojourn in strange land and that they should bring them into bondage and entreat them evil four hundred year and the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will judge say god and after that shall they come forth and serve me in this place and he give him the covenant of circumcision and so abraham begat isaac and circumcise him the eighth day and isaac begat jacob and jacob begat the twelve patriarch and the patriarch move with envy sell joseph into egypt but god be with him and deliver him out of all his affliction and give him favour and wisdom in the sight of pharaoh

heard that there be corn in egypt he sent out our father first and at the second time joseph be make know to his brother and joseph kindred be make know unto pharaoh then sent joseph and call his father jacob to him and all his kindred threescore and fifteen soul so jacob go down into egypt and die he and our father and be carry over into sychem and laid in the sepulchre that abraham bought

the witness laid down their clothes at young man foot whose name be saul and they stone stephen call upon god and say lord jesus receive my spirit and he kneel down and cry with loud voice lord lay not this sin to their charge and when he have say this he fell asleep and saul be consent unto his death and at that time there be great persecution against the church which be at jerusalem and they be all scatter abroad throughout the region of judaea and samaria except the apostle and devout men carry stephen to his burial and make great lamentation over him a for saul he make havock of the church enter into every house and hale men and woman commit them to prison therefore they that be scatter abroad go every where preach the word then philip go down to the city of samaria and preach

this power that on whomsoever lay hand he may receive the holy ghost but peter say unto him thy money perish with thee because thou hast thought that the gift of god may be purchase with money thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter for thy heart be not right in the sight of god repent therefore of this thy wickedness and pray god if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee for perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity then answer simon and say pray ye to the lord for me that none of these thing which ye have spoken come upon me and they when they have testify and preach the word of the lord return to jerusalem and preach the gospel in many village of the samaritan and the angel of the lord spake unto philip say arise and go

who have the charge of all her treasure and have come to jerusalem for to worship be return and sit in his chariot read esaias the prophet then the spirit say unto philip go near and join thyself to

that he would come up and sit with him the place of the scripture which he read be this he be lead a sheep to the slaughter and like lamb dumb before his shearer so open he not his mouth in his humiliation his judgment be take away and who shall declare his generation for his life be take from the earth and the eunuch answer philip and say pray thee of whom speaketh the prophet this of

they have fulfil them in condemn him and though they found no cause of death in him yet desire they pilate that he should be slain and when they have fulfil all that be write of him they take him down from the tree and laid him in sepulchre but god raise him from the dead and he be see many day of them which come up with him from galilee to jerusalem who be his witness unto the people and we declare unto you glad tidings how that the promise which be make unto the father god hath fulfil the same unto u their child in that he hath raise up jesus again a it be also write in the second psalm thou art my son this day have begotten thee and a concern that he raise him up from the dead now no more to return to corruption he say on this wise will give you the sure mercy of david wherefore he saith also in another psalm thou shalt not suffer thine holy one to see corruption for david after he have serve his own generation by the will of god fell on sleep and be laid unto his father and saw corruption but he whom god raise again saw no corruption be it know unto you therefore men and brother that through this man be preach unto you the forgiveness of sin and by him all that believe be justified from all thing from which ye could not be justified by the law of moses beware therefore l that come upon you which be spoken of in the prophet behold ye despisers and wonder and perish for work work in your day work which ye shall in no wise believe though man declare it unto you and when the jew be go out of the synagogue the gentile besought that these word might be preach to them the next sabbath now when the congregation be broken up many of the jew and religious proselyte follow paul and barnabas who speak to them persuade them to continue in the grace of god and the next sabbath day come almost the whole city together to hear the word of god but when the jew saw the multitude they be fill with envy and spake against those thing which be spoken by paul contradict and blaspheming then paul and barnabas waxed bold and say it be necessary that the word of god should first have be spoken to you but see ye put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the gentile for so hath the lord command u say have set thee to be light of the gentile that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the end of the earth and when the gentile heard this they be glad and glorify the word of the lord and a many a be ordain to eternal life believe and the word of the lord be publish throughout all the region but the jew stir up the devout and honourable woman and the chief men of the city and raise persecution against paul and barnabas and expel them out of their coast but they shook off the dust of their foot against them and come unto iconium and the disciple be fill with joy and with the holy ghost and it come to pas in iconium that they go both together into the synagogue of the jew and so spake that great multitude both of the jew and also of the greek believe but the unbelieving jew stir up the gentile and make their mind evil affected against the brother long time therefore abode they speak boldly in the lord which give testimony unto the word of his grace and grant sign and wonder to be do by their hand but the multitude of the city be divide and part held with the jew and part with the apostle and when there be an assault make both of the gentile and also of the jew with their ruler to use them despitefully and to stone them they be ware of it and flee unto lystra and derbe city of lycaonia and unto the region that lieth round about and there they preach the gospel and there sat certain man at lystra impotent in his foot be cripple from his mother womb who never have walk the same heard paul speak who stedfastly beholding him and perceive that he have faith to be heal say with loud voice stand upright on thy foot and he leap and walk and when the people saw what paul have do they lift up their voice say in the speech of lycaonia the god be come down to u in the likeness of men and they call barnabas jupiter and paul mercurius because he be the chief speaker then the priest of jupiter which be before their city brought ox and garland unto the gate and would have do sacrifice with the people which when the apostle barnabas and paul heard of they rent their clothes and ran in among the people cry out and say sir why do ye these thing we also be men of like passion with you and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanity unto the living god which make heaven and earth and the sea and all thing that be therein who in time past suffer all nation to walk in their own way nevertheless he left not himself without witness in that he do good and give u rain from heaven and fruitful season fill our heart with food and gladness and with these saying scarce restrain they the people that they have not do sacrifice unto them and there come thither certain jew from antioch and iconium who persuade the people and have stone paul drew him out of the city suppose he have be dead howbeit a the disciple stood round about him he rise up and come into the city and the next day he depart with barnabas to derbe and when they have preach the gospel to that city and have taught many they return again to lystra and to iconium and antioch confirm the soul of the disciple and exhort them to continue in the faith and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of god and when they have ordain them elder in every church and have prayed with fast they commend them to the lord on whom they believe and after they have pass throughout pisidia they come to pamphylia and when they have preach the word in perga they go down into attalia and thence sail to antioch from whence they have be recommend to the grace of god for the work which they fulfil and when they be come and have gather the church together they rehearse all that god have do with them and how he have open the door of faith unto the gentile and there they abode long time with the disciple and certain men which come down from judaea taught the brother and say except ye be circumcise after the manner of moses ye cannot be save when therefore paul and barnabas have no small dissension and disputation with them they determine that paul and barnabas and certain other of them should go up to jerusalem unto the apostle and elder about this question and be brought on their way by the church they pass through phenice and samaria declare the conversion of the gentile and they cause great joy unto all the brother and when they be come to jerusalem they be receive of the church and of the apostle and elder and they declare all thing that god have do with them but there rise up certain of the sect of the pharisee which believe say that it be needful to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of moses and the apostle and elder come together for to consider of this matter and when there have be much dispute peter rise up and say unto them men and brother ye know how that good while ago god make choice among u that the gentile by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel and believe and god which knoweth the heart bare them witness give them the holy ghost even a he do unto u and put no difference between u and them purify their heart by faith now therefore why tempt ye god to put yoke upon the neck of the disciple which neither our father nor we be able to bear but we believe that through the grace of the lord jesus christ we shall be save even a they then all the multitude kept silence and give audience to barnabas and paul declare what miracle and wonder god have wrought among the gentile by them and after they have held their peace james answer say men and brother hearken unto me simeon hath declare how god at the first do visit the gentile to take out of them people for his name and to this agree the word of the prophet a it be write after this will return and will build again the tabernacle of david which be fall down and will build again the ruin thereof and will set it up that the residue of men might seek after the lord and all the gentile upon whom my name be call saith the lord who doeth all these thing know unto god be all his work from the begin of the world wherefore my sentence be that we trouble not them which from among the gentile be turn to god but that we write unto them that they abstain from pollution of idol and from fornication and from thing strangle and from blood for moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him be read in the synagogue every sabbath day then pleased it the apostle and elder with the whole church to send chosen men of their own company to antioch with paul and barnabas namely juda surnamed barsabas and silas chief men among the brother and they write letter by them after this manner the apostle and elder and brother send greet unto the brother which be of the gentile in antioch and syria and cilicia forasmuch a we have heard that certain which go out from u have troubled you with word subvert your soul say ye must be circumcise and keep the law to whom we give no such commandment it seem good unto u be assemble with one accord to send chosen men unto you with our beloved barnabas and paul men that have hazard their life for the name of our lord jesus christ we have sent therefore juda and silas who shall also tell you the same thing by mouth for it seem good to the holy ghost and to u to lay upon you no great burden than these necessary thing that ye abstain from meat offer to idol and from blood and from thing strangle and from fornication from which if ye keep yourselves ye shall do well fare ye well so when they be dismiss they come to antioch and when they have gather the multitude together they deliver the epistle which when they have read they rejoice for the consolation and juda and silas be prophet also themselves exhort the brother with many word and confirm them and after they have tarry there space they be let go in peace from the brother unto the apostle notwithstanding it pleased silas to abide there still paul also and barnabas continued in antioch teach and preach the word of the lord with many others also and some day after paul say unto barnabas let u go again and visit our brother in every city where we have preach the word of the lord and see how they do and barnabas determine to take with them john whose surname be mark but paul thought not good to take him with them who depart from them from pamphylia and go not with them to the work and the contention be so sharp between them that they depart asunder one from the other and so barnabas take mark and sail unto cyprus and paul chose silas and depart be recommend by the brother unto the grace of god and he go through syria and cilicia confirm the church then come he to derbe and lystra and behold certain disciple be there name timotheus the son of certain woman which be jewess and believe but his father be greek which be well report of by the brother that be at lystra and iconium him would paul have to go forth with him and take and circumcise him because of the jew which be in those quarter for they knew all that his father be greek and a they go through the city they deliver them the decree for to keep that be ordain of the apostle and elder which be at jerusalem and so be the church establish in the faith and increase in number daily now when they have go throughout phrygia and the region of galatia and be forbidden of the holy ghost to preach the word in asia after they be come to mysia they assayed to go into bithynia but the spirit suffer them not and they passing by mysia come down to troas and vision appear to paul in the night there stood man of macedonia and prayed him say come over into macedonia and help u and after he have see the vision immediately we endeavour to go into macedonia assuredly gathering that the lord have call u for to preach the gospel unto them therefore loose from troas we come with straight course to samothracia and the next day to neapolis and from thence to philippi which be the chief city of that part of macedonia and colony and we be in that city abide certain day and on the sabbath we go out of the city by river side where prayer be wont to be make and we sat down and spake unto the woman which resort thither and certain woman name lydia seller of purple of the city of thyatira which worship god heard u whose heart the lord open that she attend unto the thing which be spoken of paul and when she be baptize and her household she besought u say if ye have judged me to be faithful to the lord come into my house and abide there and she constrain u and it come to pas a we go to prayer certain damsel possess with spirit of divination met u which brought her master much gain by soothsaying the same follow paul and u and cry say these men be the servant of the most high god which shew unto u the way of salvation and this do she many day but paul be grieve turn and say to the spirit command thee in the name of jesus christ to come out of her and he come out the same hour and when her master saw that the hope of their gain be go they caught paul and silas and drew them into the marketplace unto the ruler and brought them to the magistrate say these men be jew do exceedingly trouble our city and teach custom which be not lawful for u to receive neither to observe be roman and the multitude rise up together against them and the magistrate rent off their clothes and command to beat them and when they have laid many stripe upon them they cast them into prison charge the jailor to keep them safely who have receive such charge thrust them into the inner prison and make their foot fast in the stock and at midnight paul and silas prayed and sang praise unto god and the prisoner heard them and suddenly there be great earthquake so that the foundation of the prison be shaken and immediately all the door be open and every one band be loose and the keeper of the prison awake out of his sleep and see the prison door open he drew out his sword and would have kill himself suppose that the prisoner have be flee but paul cry with loud voice say do thyself no harm for we be all here then he call for light and sprang in and come tremble and fell down before paul and silas and brought them out and say sir what must do to be save and they say believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be save and thy house and they spake unto him the word of the lord and to all that be in his house and he take them the same hour of the night and wash their stripe and be baptize he and all his straightway and when he have brought them into his house he set meat before them and rejoice believe in god with all his house and when it be day the magistrate sent the serjeant say let those men go and the keeper of the prison told this say to paul the magistrate have sent to let you go now therefore depart and go in peace but paul say unto them they have beaten u openly uncondemned be roman and have cast u into prison and now do they thrust u out privily nay verily but let them come themselves and fetch u out and the serjeant told these word unto the magistrate and they fear when they heard that they be roman and they come and besought them and brought them out and desire them to depart out of the city and they go out of the prison and enter into the house of lydia and when they have see the brother they comfort them and depart now when they have pass through amphipolis and apollonia they come to thessalonica where be synagogue of the jew and paul a his manner be go in unto them and three sabbath day reason with them out of the scripture opening and allege that christ must need have suffer and risen again from the dead and that this jesus whom preach unto you be christ and some of them believe and consort with paul and silas and of the devout greek great multitude and of the chief woman not few but the jew which believe not move with envy take unto them certain lewd fellow of the baser sort and gather company and set all the city on an uproar and assault the house of jason and sought to bring them out to the people and when they found them not they drew jason and certain brother unto the ruler of the city cry these that have turn the world upside down be come hither also whom jason hath receive and these all do contrary to the decree of caesar say that there be another king one jesus and they troubled the people and the ruler of the city when they heard these thing and when they have take security of jason and of the other they let them go and the brother immediately sent away paul and silas by night unto berea who come thither go into the synagogue of the jew these be more noble than those in thessalonica in that they receive the word with all readiness of mind and search the scripture daily whether those thing be so therefore many of them believe also of honourable woman which be greek and of men not few but when the jew of thessalonica have knowledge that the word of god be preach of paul at berea they come thither also and stir up the people and then immediately the brother sent away paul to go a it be to the sea but silas and timotheus abode there still and they that conduct paul brought him unto athens and receive commandment unto silas and timotheus for to come to him with all speed they depart now while paul wait for them at athens his spirit be stir in him when he saw the city wholly give to idolatry therefore dispute he in the synagogue with the jew and with the devout person and in the market daily with them that met with him then certain philosopher of the epicurean and of the stoicks encounter him and some say what will this babbler say other some he seemeth to be setter forth of strange god because he preach unto them jesus and the resurrection and they take him and brought him unto areopagus say may we know what this new doctrine whereof thou speakest be for thou bringest certain strange thing to our ear we would know therefore what these thing mean for all the athenian and stranger which be there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing then paul stood in the midst of mar hill and say ye men of athens perceive that in all thing ye be too superstitious for a pass by and beheld your devotion found an altar with this inscription to the unknown god whom therefore ye ignorantly worship him declare unto you god that make the world and all thing therein see that he be lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temple make with hand neither be worship with men hand a though he need any thing see he giveth to all life and breath and all thing and hath make of one blood all nation of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth and hath determine the time before appoint and the bound of their habitation that they should seek the lord if haply they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of u for in him we live and move and have our be a certain also of your own poet have say for we be also his offspring forasmuch then a we be the offspring of god we ought not to think that the godhead be like unto gold or silver or stone graven by art and man device and the time of this ignorance god wink at but now commandeth all men every where to repent because he hath appoint day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordain whereof he hath give assurance unto all men in that he hath raise him from the dead and when they heard of the resurrection of the dead some mocked and others say we will hear thee again of this matter so paul depart from among them howbeit certain men clave unto him and believe among the which be dionysius the areopagite and woman name damaris and others with them after these thing paul depart from athens and come to corinth and found certain jew name aquila born in pontus lately come from italy with his wife priscilla because that claudius have command all jew to depart from rome and come unto them and because he be of the same craft he abode with them and wrought for by their occupation they be tentmaker and he reason in the synagogue every sabbath and persuade the jew and the greek and when silas and timotheus be come from macedonia paul be press in the spirit and testify to the jew that jesus be christ and when they oppose themselves and blaspheme he shook his raiment and say unto them your blood be upon your own head be clean from henceforth will go unto the gentile and he depart thence and enter into certain man house name justus one that worship god whose house join hard to the synagogue and crispus the chief ruler of the synagogue believe on the lord with all his house and many of the corinthian hearing believe and be baptize then spake the lord to paul in the night by vision be not afraid but speak and hold not thy peace for be with thee and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee for have much people in this city and he continued there year and six month teach the word of god among them and when gallio be the deputy of achaia the jew make insurrection with one accord against paul and brought him to the judgment seat say this fellow persuadeth men to worship god contrary to the law and when paul be now about to open his mouth gallio say unto the jew if it be matter of wrong or wicked lewdness ye jew reason would that should bear with you but if it be question of word and name and of your law look ye to it for will be no judge of such matter and he drave them from the judgment seat then all the greek take sosthenes the chief ruler of the synagogue and beat him before the judgment seat and gallio care for none of those thing and paul after this tarry there yet good while and then take his leave of the brother and sail thence into syria and with him priscilla and aquila have shorn his head in cenchrea for he have vow and he come to ephesus and left them there but he himself enter into the synagogue and reason with the jew when they desire him to tarry longer time with them he consent not but bade them farewell say must by all mean keep this feast that cometh in jerusalem but will return again unto you if god will and he sail from ephesus and when he have land at caesarea and go up and salute the church he go down to antioch and after he have spent some time there he depart and go over all the country of galatia and phrygia in order strengthen all the disciple and certain jew name apollo born at alexandria an eloquent man and mighty in the scripture come to ephesus this man be instruct in the way of the lord and be fervent in the spirit he spake and taught diligently the thing of the lord know only the baptism of john and he begin to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when aquila and priscilla have heard they take him unto them and expound unto him the way of god more perfectly and when he be dispose to pas into achaia the brother write exhort the disciple to receive him who when he be come help them much which have believe through grace for he mightily convince the jew and that publickly shew by the scripture that jesus be christ and it come to pas that while apollo be at corinth paul have pass through the upper coast come to ephesus and find certain disciple he say unto them have ye receive the holy ghost since ye believe and they say unto him we have not so much a heard whether there be any holy ghost and he say unto them unto what then be ye baptize and they say unto john baptism then say paul john verily baptize with the baptism of repentance say unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that be on christ jesus when they heard this they be baptize in the name of the lord jesus and when paul have laid his hand upon them the holy ghost come on them and they spake with tongue and prophesy and all the men be about twelve and he go into the synagogue and spake boldly for the space of three month dispute and persuade the thing concern the kingdom of god but when diver be harden and believe not but spake evil of that way before the multitude he depart from them and separate the disciple dispute daily in the school of one tyrannus and this continued by the space of two year so that all they which dwelt in asia heard the word of the lord jesus both jew and greek and god wrought special miracle by the hand of paul so that from his body be brought unto the sick handkerchief or apron and the disease depart from them and the evil spirit go out of them then certain of the vagabond jew exorcist take upon them to call over them which have evil spirit the name of the lord jesus say we adjure you by jesus whom paul preacheth and there be seven son of one sceva jew and chief of the priest which do so and the evil spirit answer and say jesus know and paul know but who be ye and the man in whom the evil spirit be leap on them and overcame them and prevail against them so that they flee out of that house naked and wound and this be know to all the jew and greek also dwell at ephesus and fear fell on them all and the name of the lord jesus be magnify and many that believe come and confess and shew their deed many of them also which use curious art brought their book together and burn them before all men and they count the price of them and found it fifty thousand piece of silver so mightily grow the word of god and prevail after these thing be end paul purpose in the spirit when he have pass through macedonia and achaia to go to jerusalem say after have be there must also see rome so he sent into macedonia two of them that minister unto him timotheus and erastus but he himself stayed in asia for season and the same time there arose no small stir about that way for certain man name demetrius silversmith which make silver shrine for diana brought no small gain unto the craftsman whom he call together with the workman of like occupation and say sir ye know that by this craft we have our wealth moreover ye see and hear that not alone at ephesus but almost throughout all asia this paul hath persuade and turn away much people say that they be no god which be make with hand so that not only this our craft be in danger to be set at nought but also that the temple of the great goddess diana should be despise and her magnificence should be destroyed whom all asia and the world worshippeth and when they heard these saying they be full of wrath and cry out say great be diana of the ephesian and the whole city be fill with confusion and have caught gaius and aristarchus men of macedonia paul companion in travel they rush with one accord into the theatre and when paul would have enter in unto the people the disciple suffer him not and certain of the chief of asia which be his friend sent unto him desire him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre some therefore cry one thing and some another for the assembly be confuse and the more part knew not wherefore they be come together and they drew alexander out of the multitude the jew put him forward and alexander beckon with the hand and would have make his defence unto the people but when they knew that he be jew all with one voice about the space of two hour cry out great be diana of the ephesian and when the townclerk have appease the people he say ye men of ephesus what man be there that knoweth not how that the city of the ephesian be worshipper of the great goddess diana and of the image which fell down from jupiter see then that these thing cannot be spoken against ye ought to be quiet and to do nothing rashly for ye have brought hither these men which be neither robber of church nor yet blasphemer of your goddess wherefore if demetrius and the craftsman which be with him have matter against any man the law be open and there be deputy let them implead one another but if ye enquire any thing concern other matter it shall be determine in lawful assembly for we be in danger to be call in question for this day uproar there be no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse and when he have thus spoken he dismiss the assembly and after the uproar be cease paul call unto him the disciple and embrace them and depart for to go into macedonia and when he have go over those part and have give them much exhortation he come into greece and there abode three month and when the jew laid wait for him a he be about to sail into syria he purpose to return through macedonia and there accompany him into asia sopater of berea and of the thessalonian aristarchus and secundus and gaius of derbe and timotheus and of asia tychicus and trophimus these go before tarry for u at troas and we sail away from philippi after the day of unleavened bread and come unto them to troas in five day where we abode seven day and upon the first day of the week when the disciple come together to break bread paul preach unto them ready to depart on the morrow and continued his speech until midnight and there be many light in the upper chamber where they be gather together and there sat in window certain young man name eutychus be fall into deep sleep and a paul be long preach he sunk down with sleep and fell down from the third loft and be take up dead and paul go down and fell on him and embrace him say trouble not yourselves for his life be in him when he therefore be come up again and have broken bread and eat and talk long while even till break of day so he depart and they brought the young man alive and be not little comfort and we go before to ship and sail unto assos there intend to take in paul for so have he appoint mind himself to go afoot and when he met with u at assos we take him in and come to mitylene and we sail thence and come the next day over against chios and the next day we arrive at samos and tarry at trogyllium and the next day we come to miletus for paul have determine to sail by ephesus because he would not spend the time in asia for he hasted if it be possible for him to be at jerusalem the day of pentecost and from miletus he sent to ephesus and call the elder of the church and when they be come to him he say unto them ye know from the first day that come into asia after what manner have be with you at all season serve the lord with all humility of mind and with many tear and temptation which befell me by the lie in wait of the jew and how kept back nothing that be profitable unto you but have shew you and have taught you publickly and from house to house testify both to the jew and also to the greek repentance toward god and faith toward our lord jesus christ and now behold go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem not know the thing that shall befall me there save that the holy ghost witnesseth in every city say that bond and affliction abide me but none of these thing move me neither count my life dear unto myself so that might finish my course with joy and the ministry which have receive of the lord jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of god and now behold know that ye all among whom have go preach the kingdom of god shall see my face no more wherefore take you to record this day that be pure from the blood of all men for have not shun to declare unto you all the counsel of god take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over the which the holy ghost hath make you overseer to feed the church of god which he hath purchase with his own blood for know this that after my depart shall grievous wolf enter in among you not spar the flock also of your own self shall men arise speak perverse thing to draw away disciple after them therefore watch and remember that by the space of three year cease not to warn every one night and day with tear and now brother commend you to god and to the word of his grace which be able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them which be sanctify have covet no man silver or gold or apparel yea ye yourselves know that these hand have minister unto my necessity and to them that be with me have shew you all thing how that so labour ye ought to support the weak and to remember the word of the lord jesus how he say it be more bless to give than to receive and when he have thus spoken he kneel down and prayed with them all and they all wept sore and fell on paul neck and kiss him sorrow most of all for the word which he spake that they should see his face no more and they accompany him unto the ship and it come to pas that after we be gotten from them and have launch we come with straight course unto coo and the day follow unto rhodes and from thence unto patara and find ship sail over unto phenicia we go aboard and set forth now when we have discover cyprus we left it on the left hand and sail into syria and land at tyre for there the ship be to unlade her burden and find disciple we tarry there seven day who say to paul through the spirit that he should not go up to jerusalem and when we have accomplish those day we depart and go our way and they all brought u on our way with wife and child till we be out of the city and we kneel down on the shore and prayed and when we have take our leave one of another we take ship and they return home again and when we have finish our course from tyre we come to ptolemais and salute the brother and abode with them one day and the next day we that be of paul company depart and come unto caesarea and we enter into the house of philip the evangelist which be one of the seven and abode with him and the same man have four daughter virgin which do prophesy and a we tarry there many day there come down from judaea certain prophet name agabus and when he be come unto u he take paul girdle and bound his own hand and foot and say thus saith the holy ghost so shall the jew at jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle and shall deliver him into the hand of the gentile and when we heard these thing both we and they of that place besought him not to go up to jerusalem then paul answer what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart for be ready not to be bound only but also to die at jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus and when he would not be persuade we cease say the will of the lord be do and after those day we take up our carriage and go up to jerusalem there go with u also certain of the disciple of caesarea and brought with them one mnason of cyprus an old disciple with whom we should lodge and when we be come to jerusalem the brother receive u gladly and the day follow paul go in with u unto james and all the elder be present and when he have salute them he declare particularly what thing god have wrought among the gentile by his ministry and when they heard it they glorify the lord and say unto him thou seest brother how many thousand of jew there be which believe and they be all zealous of the law and they be inform of thee that thou teachest all the jew which be among the gentile to forsake moses say that they ought not to circumcise their child neither to walk after the custom what be it therefore the multitude must need come together for they will hear that thou art come do therefore this that we say to thee we have four men which have vow on them them take and purify thyself with them and be at charge with them that they may shave their head and all may know that those thing whereof they be inform concern thee be nothing but that thou thyself also walkest orderly and keepest the law a touch the gentile which believe we have write and conclude that they observe no such thing save only that they keep themselves from thing offer to idol and from blood and from strangle and from fornication then paul take the men and the next day purify himself with them enter into the temple to signify the accomplishment of the day of purification until that an offering should be offer for every one of them and when the seven day be almost end the jew which be of asia when they saw him in the temple stir up all the people and laid hand on him cry out men of israel help this be the man that teacheth all men every where against the people and the law and this place and far brought greek also into the temple and hath pollute this holy place for they have see before with him in the city trophimus an ephesian whom they suppose that paul have brought into the temple and all the city be move and the people ran together and they take paul and drew him out of the temple and forthwith the door be shut and a they go about to kill him tidings come unto the chief captain of the band that all jerusalem be in an uproar who immediately take soldier and centurion and ran down unto them and when they saw the chief captain and the soldier they left beating of paul then the chief captain come near and take him and command him to be bound with two chain and demand who he be and what he have do and some cry one thing some another among the multitude and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult he command him to be carry into the castle and when he come upon the stair so it be that he be borne of the soldier for the violence of the people for the multitude of the people follow after cry away with him and a paul be to be lead into the castle he say unto the chief captain may speak unto thee who say canst thou speak greek art not thou that egyptian which before these day mad an uproar and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that be murderer but paul say be man which be jew of tarsus city in cilicia citizen of no mean city and beseech thee suffer me to speak unto the people and when he have give him licence paul stood on the stair and beckon with the hand unto the people and when there be make great silence he spake unto them in the hebrew tongue say men brother and father hear ye my defence which make now unto you and when they heard that he spake in the hebrew tongue to them they kept the more silence and he saith be verily man which be jew born in tarsus city in cilicia yet brought up in this city at the foot of gamaliel and taught accord to the perfect manner of the law of the father and be zealous toward god a ye all be this day and persecute this way unto the death

bring them which be there bound unto jerusalem for to be punish and it come to pas that a make my journey and be come nigh unto damascus about noon suddenly there shone from heaven great light round about me and fell unto the ground and heard voice say unto me saul saul why persecutest thou me and answer who art thou lord and he say unto me be jesus of nazareth whom thou persecutest and they that be with me saw indeed the light and be afraid but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me and say what shall do lord and the lord say unto me arise and go into damascus and there it shall be told thee of all thing which be appoint for thee to do and when could not see for the glory of that light be lead by the hand of them that be with me come into damascus and one ananias devout man accord to the law have good report of all the jew which dwelt there come unto me and stood and say unto me brother saul receive thy sight and the same hour look up upon him and he say the god of our father hath chosen thee that thou shouldest know his will and see that just one and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth for thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast see and heard and now why tarriest thou arise and be baptize and wash away thy sin call on the name of the lord and it come to pas that when be come again to jerusalem even while prayed in the temple be in trance and saw him say unto me make haste and get thee quickly out of jerusalem for they will not receive thy testimony concern me and say lord they know that imprison and beat in every synagogue them that believe on thee and when the blood of thy martyr stephen be shed also be stand by and consent unto his death and kept the raiment of them that slew him and he say unto me depart for will send thee far hence unto the gentile and they give him audience unto this word and then lift up their voice and say away with such fellow from the earth for it be not fit that he should live and a they cry out and cast off their clothes and threw dust into the air the chief captain command him to be brought into the castle and bade that he should be examine by scourge that he might know wherefore they cry so against him and a they bound him with thong paul say unto the centurion that stood by be it lawful for you to scourge man that be roman and uncondemned when the centurion heard that he go and told the chief captain say take heed what thou doest for this man be roman then the chief captain come and say unto him tell me art thou roman he say yea and the chief captain answer with great sum obtain this freedom and paul say but be free born then straightway they depart from him which should have examine him and the chief captain also be afraid after he knew that he be roman and because he have bound him on the morrow because he would have know the certainty wherefore he be accuse of the jew he loose him from his band and command the chief priest and all their council to appear and brought paul down and set him before them and paul earnestly beholding the council say men and brother have live in all good conscience before god until this day and the high priest ananias command them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth then say paul unto him god shall smite thee thou white wall for sittest thou to judge me after the law and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law and they that stood by say revilest thou god high priest then say paul wist not brother that he be the high priest for it be write thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people but when paul perceive that the one part be sadducee and the other pharisee he cry out in the council men and brother be pharisee the son of pharisee of the hope and resurrection of the dead be call in question and when he have so say there arose dissension between the pharisee and the sadducee and the multitude be divide for the sadducee say that there be no resurrection neither angel nor spirit but the pharisee confess both and there arose great cry and the scribe that be of the pharisee part arose and strove say we find no evil in this man but if spirit or an angel hath spoken to him let u not fight against god and when there arose great dissension the chief captain fear l paul should have be pull in piece of them command the soldier to go down and to take him by force from among them and to bring him into the castle and the night follow the lord stood by him and say be of good cheer paul for a thou hast testify of me in jerusalem so must thou bear witness also at rome and when it be day certain of the jew band together and bound themselves under curse say that they would neither eat nor drink till they have kill paul and they be more than forty which have make this conspiracy and they come to the chief priest and elder and say we have bound ourselves under great curse that we will eat nothing until we have slain paul now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow a though ye would enquire something more perfectly concern him and we or ever he come near be ready to kill him and when paul sister son heard of their lie in wait he go and enter into the castle and told paul then paul call one of the centurion unto him and say bring this young man unto the chief captain for he hath certain thing to tell him so he take him and brought him to the chief captain and say paul the prisoner call me unto him and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee who hath something to say unto thee then the chief captain take him by the hand and go with him aside privately and ask him what be that thou hast to tell me and he say the jew have agree to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down paul to morrow into the council a though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly but do not thou yield unto them for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men which have bound themselves with an oath that they will neither eat nor drink till they have kill him and now be they ready look for promise from thee so the chief captain then let the young man depart and charge him see thou tell no man that thou hast shew these thing to me and he call unto him two centurion say make ready two hundred soldier to go to caesarea and horseman threescore and ten and spearmen two hundred at the third hour of the night and provide them beast that they may set paul on and bring him safe unto felix the governor and he write letter after this manner claudius lysias unto the most excellent governor felix sendeth greet this man be take of the jew and should have be kill of them then come with an army and rescue him have understood that he be roman and when would have know the cause wherefore they accuse him brought him forth into their council whom perceive to be accuse of question of their law but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bond and when it be told me how that the jew laid wait for the man sent straightway to thee and give commandment to his accuser also to say before thee what they have against him farewell then the soldier a it be command them take paul and brought him by night to antipatris on the morrow they left the horseman to go with him and return to the castle who when they come to caesarea and deliver the epistle to the governor present paul also before him and when the governor have read the letter he ask of what province he be and when he understood that he be of cilicia will hear thee say he when thine accuser be also come and he command him to be kept in herod judgment hall and after five day ananias the high priest descend with the elder and with certain orator name tertullus who inform the governor against paul and when he be call forth tertullus begin to accuse him say see that by thee we enjoy great quietness and that very worthy deed be do unto this nation by thy providence we accept it always and in all place most noble felix with all thankfulness notwithstanding that be not far tedious unto thee pray thee that thou wouldest hear u of thy clemency few word for we have found this man pestilent fellow and mover of sedition among all the jew throughout the world and ringleader of the sect of the nazarene who also hath go about to profane the temple whom we take and would have judged accord to our law but the chief captain lysias come upon u and with great violence take him away out of our hand command his accuser to come unto thee by examine of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these thing whereof we accuse him and the jew also assent say that these thing be so then paul after that the governor have beckon unto him to speak answer forasmuch a know that thou hast be of many year judge unto this nation do the more cheerfully answer for myself because that thou mayest understand that there be yet but twelve day since go up to jerusalem for to worship and they neither found me in the temple dispute with any man neither raise up the people neither in the synagogue nor in the city neither can they prove the thing whereof they now accuse me but this confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy so worship the god of my father believe all thing which be write in the law and in the prophet and have hope toward god which they themselves also allow that there shall be resurrection of the dead both of the just and unjust and herein do exercise myself to have always conscience void to offence toward god and toward men now after many year come to bring alms to my nation and offering whereupon certain jew from asia found me purify in the temple neither with multitude nor with tumult who ought to have be here before thee and object if they have ought against me or else let these same here say if they have found any evil do in me while stood before the council except it be for this one voice that cry stand among them touch the resurrection of the dead be call in question by you this day and when felix heard these thing have more perfect knowledge of that way he defer them and say when lysias the chief captain shall come down will know the uttermost of your matter and he command centurion to keep paul and to let him have liberty and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him and after certain day when felix come with his wife drusilla which be jewess he sent for paul and heard him concern the faith in christ and a he reason of righteousness temperance and judgment to come felix tremble and answer go thy way for this time when have convenient season will call for thee he hop also that money should have be give him of paul that he might loose him wherefore he sent for him the oftener and commune with him but after two year porcius festus come into felix room and felix willing to shew the jew pleasure left paul bound now when festus be come into the province after three day he ascend from caesarea to jerusalem then the high priest and the chief of the jew inform him against paul and besought him and desire favour against him that he would send for him to jerusalem lay wait in the way to kill him but festus answer that paul should be kept at caesarea and that he himself would depart shortly thither let them therefore say he which among you be able go down with me and accuse this man if there be any wickedness in him and when he have tarry among them more than ten day he go down unto caesarea and the next day sit on the judgment seat command paul to be brought and when he be come the jew which come down from jerusalem stood round about and laid many and grievous complaint against paul which they could not prove while he answer for himself neither against the law of the jew neither against the temple nor yet against caesar have offend any thing at all but festus willing to do the jew pleasure answer paul and say wilt thou go up to jerusalem and there be judged of these thing before me then say paul stand at caesar judgment seat where ought to be judged to the jew have do no wrong a thou very well knowest for if be an offender or have commit any thing worthy of death refuse not to die but if there be none of these thing whereof these accuse me no man may deliver me unto them appeal unto caesar then festus when he have confer with the council answer hast thou appeal unto caesar unto caesar shalt thou go and after certain day king agrippa and bernice come unto caesarea to salute festus and when they have be there many day festus declare paul cause unto the king say there be certain man left in bond by felix about whom when be at jerusalem the chief priest and the elder of the jew inform me desire to have judgment against him to whom answer it be not the manner of the roman to deliver any man to die before that he which be accuse have the accuser face to face and have licence to answer for himself concern the crime laid against him therefore when they be come hither without any delay on the morrow sat on the judgment seat and command the man to be brought forth against whom when the accuser stood up they brought none accusation of such thing a suppose but have certain question against him of their own superstition and of one jesus which be dead whom paul affirm to be alive and because doubt of such manner of question ask him whether he would go to jerusalem and there be judged of these matter but when paul have appeal to be reserve unto the hearing of augustus command him to be kept till might send him to caesar then agrippa say unto festus would also hear the man myself to morrow say he thou shalt hear him and on the morrow when agrippa be come and bernice with great pomp and be enter into the place of hearing with the chief captain and principal men of the city at festus commandment paul be brought forth and festus say king agrippa and all men which be here present with u ye see this man about whom all the multitude of the jew have dealt with me both at jerusalem and also here cry that he ought not to live any longer but when found that he have commit nothing worthy of death and that he himself hath appeal to augustus have determine to send him of whom have no certain thing to write unto my lord wherefore have brought him forth before you and specially before thee king agrippa that after examination have might have somewhat to write for it seemeth to me unreasonable to send prisoner and not withal to signify the crime laid against him then agrippa say unto paul thou art permit to speak for thyself then paul stretch forth the hand and answer for himself think myself happy king agrippa because shall answer for myself this day before thee touch all the thing whereof be accuse of the jew especially because know thee to be expert in all custom and question which be among the jew wherefore beseech thee to hear me patiently my manner of life from my youth which be at the first among mine own nation at jerusalem know all the jew which knew me from the begin if they would testify that after the most straitest sect of our religion live pharisee and now stand and be judged for the hope of the promise make of god unto our father unto which promise our twelve tribe instantly serve god day and night hope to come for which hope sake king agrippa be accuse of the jew why should it be thought thing incredible with you that god should raise the dead verily thought with myself that ought to do many thing contrary to the name of jesus of nazareth which thing also do in jerusalem and many of the saint do shut up in prison have receive authority from the chief priest and when they be put to death give my voice against them and punish them oft in every synagogue and compel them to blaspheme and be exceedingly mad against them persecute them even unto strange city whereupon a go to damascus with authority and commission from the chief priest at midday king saw in the way light from heaven above the brightness of the sun shin round about me and them which journeyed with me and when we be all fall to the earth heard voice speak unto me and say in the hebrew tongue saul saul why persecutest thou me it be hard for thee to kick against the prick and say who art thou lord and he say be jesus whom thou persecutest but rise and stand upon thy foot for have appear unto thee for this purpose to make thee minister and witness both of these thing which thou hast see and of those thing in the which will appear unto thee deliver thee from the people and from the gentile unto whom now send thee to open their eye and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god that they may receive forgiveness of sin and inheritance among them which be sanctify by faith that be in me whereupon king agrippa be not disobedient unto the heavenly vision but shew first unto them of damascus and at jerusalem and throughout all the coast of judaea and then to the gentile that they should repent and turn to god and do work meet for repentance for these cause the jew caught me in the temple and go about to kill me have therefore obtain help of god continue unto this day witness both to small and great say none other thing than those which the prophet and moses do say should come that christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead and should shew light unto the people and to the gentile and a he thus spake for himself festus say with loud voice paul thou art beside thyself much learn doth make thee mad but he say be not mad most noble festus but speak forth the word of truth and soberness for the king knoweth of these thing before whom also speak freely for be persuade that none of these thing be hidden from him for this thing be not do in corner king agrippa believest thou the prophet know that thou believest then agrippa say unto paul almost thou persuadest me to be christian and paul say would to god that not only thou but also all that hear me this day be both almost and altogether such a be except these bond and when he have thus spoken the king rise up and the governor and bernice and they that sat with them and when they be go aside they talk between themselves say this man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bond then say agrippa unto festus this man might have be set at liberty if he have not appeal unto caesar and when it be determine that we should sail into italy they deliver paul and certain other prisoner unto one name julius centurion of augustus band and enter into ship of adramyttium we launch meaning to sail by the coast of asia one aristarchus macedonian of thessalonica be with u and the next day we touch at sidon and julius courteously entreat paul and give him liberty to go unto his friend to refresh himself and when we have launch from thence we sail under cyprus because the wind be contrary and when we have sail over the sea of cilicia and pamphylia we come to myra city of lycia and there the centurion found ship of alexandria sail into italy and he put u therein and when we have sail slowly many day and scarce be come over against cnidus the wind not suffer u we sail under crete over against salmone and hardly passing it come unto place which be call the fair haven nigh whereunto be the city of lasea now when much time be spent and when sail be now dangerous because the fast be now already past paul admonish them and say unto them sir perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage not only of the lade and ship but also of our life nevertheless the centurion believe the master and the owner of the ship more than those thing which be spoken by paul and because the haven be not commodious to winter in the more part advise to depart thence also if by any mean they might attain to phenice and there to winter which be an haven of crete and lieth toward the south west and north west and when the south wind blew softly suppose that they have obtain their purpose loose thence they sail close by crete but not long after there arose against it tempestuous wind call euroclydon and when the ship be caught and could not bear up into the wind we let her drive and run under certain island which be call clauda we have much work to come by the boat which when they have take up they use help undergird the ship and fear l they should fall into the quicksand strake sail and so be driven and we be exceedingly toss with tempest the next day they lighten the ship and the third day we cast out with our own hand the tackle of the ship and when neither sun nor star in many day appear and no small tempest lay on u all hope that we should be save be then take away but after long abstinence paul stood forth in the midst of them and say sir ye should have hearken unto me and not have loose from crete and to have gain this harm and loss and now exhort you to be of good cheer for there shall be no loss of any man life among you but of the ship for there stood by me this night the angel of god whose be and whom serve say fear not paul thou must be brought before caesar and lo god hath give thee all them that sail with thee wherefore sir be of good cheer for believe god that it shall be even a it be told me howbeit we must be cast upon certain island but when the fourteenth night be come a we be driven up and down in adria about midnight the shipmen deem that they drew near to some country and sound and found it twenty fathom and when they have go little far they sound again and found it fifteen fathom then fear l we should have fall upon rock they cast four anchor out of the stern and wish for the day and a the shipmen be about to flee out of the ship when they have let down the boat into the sea under colour a though they would have cast anchor out of the foreship paul say to the centurion and to the soldier except these abide in the ship ye cannot be save then the soldier cut off the rope of the boat and let her fall off and while the day be come on paul besought them all to take meat say this day be the fourteenth day that ye have tarry and continued fast have take nothing wherefore pray you to take some meat for this be for your health for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you and when he have thus spoken he take bread and give thanks to god in presence of them all and when he have broken it he begin to eat then be they all of good cheer and they also take some meat and we be in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen soul and when they have eat enough they lighten the ship and cast out the wheat into the sea and when it be day they knew not the land but they discover certain creek with shore into the which they be mind if it be possible to thrust in the ship and when they have take up the anchor they commit themselves unto the sea and loose the rudder band and hoised up the mainsail to the wind and make toward shore and fall into place where two sea met they ran the ship aground and the forepart stuck fast and remain unmoveable but the hinder part be broken with the violence of the wave and the soldier counsel be to kill the prisoner l any of them should swim out and escape but the centurion willing to save paul kept them from their purpose and command that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea and get to land and the rest some on board and some on broken piece of the ship and so it come to pas that they escape all safe to land and when they be escape then they knew that the island be call melita and the barbarous people shew u no little kindness for they kindle fire and receive u every one because of the present rain and because of the cold and when paul have gather bundle of stick and laid them on the fire there come viper out of the heat and fasten on his hand and when the barbarian saw the venomous beast hang on his hand they say among themselves no doubt this man be murderer whom though he hath escape the sea yet vengeance suffereth not to live and he shook off the beast into the fire and felt no harm howbeit they look when he should have swollen or fall down dead suddenly but after they have look great while and saw no harm come to him they change their mind and say that he be god in the same quarter be possession of the chief man of the island whose name be publius who receive u and lodge u three day courteously and it come to pas that the father of publius lay sick of fever and of bloody flux to whom paul enter in and prayed and laid his hand on him and heal him so when this be do others also which have disease in the island come and be heal who also honour u with many honour and when we depart they lade u with such thing a be necessary and after three month we depart in ship of alexandria which have winter in the isle whose sign be castor and pollux and land at syracuse we tarry there three day and from thence we fetch compass and come to rhegium and after one day the south wind blew and we come the next day to puteoli where we found brother and be desire to tarry with them seven day and so we go toward rome and from thence when the brother heard of u they come to meet u a far a appii forum and the three tavern whom when paul saw he thanked god and take courage and when we come to rome the centurion deliver the prisoner to the captain of the guard but paul be suffer to dwell by himself with soldier that kept him and it come to pas that after three day paul call the chief of the jew together and when they be come together he say unto them men and brother though have commit nothing against the people or custom of our father yet be deliver prisoner from jerusalem into the hand of the roman who when they have examine me would have let me go because there be no cause of death in me but when the jew spake against it be constrain to appeal unto caesar not that have ought to accuse my nation of for this cause therefore have call for you to see you and to speak with you because that for the hope of israel be bound with this chain and they say unto him we neither receive letter out of judaea concern thee neither any of the brother that come shew or spake any harm of thee but we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest for a concern this sect we know that every where it be spoken against and when they have appoint him day there come many to him into his lodge to whom he expound and testify the kingdom of god persuade them concern jesus both out of the law of moses and out of the prophet from morning till even and some believe the thing which be spoken and some believe not and when they agree not among themselves they depart after that paul have spoken one word well spake the holy ghost by esaias the prophet unto our father say go unto this people and say hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and see ye shall see and not perceive for the heart of this people be waxed gross and their ear be dull of hearing and their eye have they close l they should see with their eye and hear with their ear and understand with their heart and should be convert and should heal them be it know therefore unto you that the salvation of god be sent unto the gentile and that they will hear it and when he have say these word the jew depart and have great reason among themselves and paul dwelt two whole year in his own hire house and receive all that come in unto him preach the kingdom of god and teach those thing which concern the lord jesus christ with all confidence no man forbid him book roman paul servant of jesus christ call to be an apostle separate unto the gospel of god which he have promise afore by his prophet in the holy scripture concern his son jesus christ our lord which be make of the seed of david accord to the flesh and declare to be the son of god with power accord to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead by whom we have receive grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith among all nation for his name among whom be ye also the call of jesus christ to all that be in rome beloved of god call to be saint grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ first thank my god through jesus christ for you all that your faith be spoken of throughout the whole world for god be my witness whom serve with my spirit in the gospel of his son that without cease make mention of you always in my prayer make request if by any mean now at length might have prosperous journey by the will of god to come unto you for long to see you that may impart unto you some spiritual gift to the end ye may be establish that be that may be comfort together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me now would not have you ignorant brother that oftentimes purpose to come unto you but be let hitherto that might have some fruit among you also even a among other gentile be debtor both to the greek and to the barbarian both to the wise and to the unwise so a much a in me be be ready to preach the gospel to you that be at rome also for be not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it be the power of god unto salvation to every one that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek for therein be the righteousness of god reveal from faith to faith a it be write the just shall live by faith for the wrath of god be reveal from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness because that which may be know of god be manifest in them for god hath shew it unto them for the invisible thing of him from the creation of the world be clearly see be understood by the thing that be make even his eternal power and godhead so that they be without excuse because that when they knew god they glorify him not a god neither be thankful but become vain in their imagination and their foolish heart be darken profess themselves to be wise they become fool and change the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image make like to corruptible man and to bird and fourfooted beast and creep thing wherefore god also give them up to uncleanness through the lust of their own heart to dishonour their own body between themselves who change the truth of god into lie and worship and serve the creature more than the creator who be bless for ever amen for this cause god give them up unto vile affection for even their woman do change the natural use into that which be against nature and likewise also the men leave the natural use of the woman burn in their lust one toward another men with men work that which be unseemly and receive in themselves that recompence of their error which be meet and even a they do not like to retain god in their knowledge god give them over to reprobate mind to do those thing which be not convenient be fill with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whisperer backbiter hater of god despiteful proud boaster inventor of evil thing disobedient to parent without understand covenantbreakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful who know the judgment of god that they which commit such thing be worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them therefore thou art inexcusable man whosoever thou art that judgest for wherein thou judgest another thou condemnest thyself for thou that judgest doest the same thing but we be sure that the judgment of god be accord to truth against them which commit such thing and thinkest thou this man that judgest them which do such thing and doest the same that thou shalt escape the judgment of god or despisest thou the rich of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering not know that the goodness of god leadeth thee to repentance but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of god who will render to every man accord to his deed to them who by patient continuance in well do seek for glory and honour and immortality eternal life but unto them that be contentious and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness indignation and wrath tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil of the jew first and also of the gentile but glory honour and peace to every man that worketh good to the jew first and also to the gentile for there be no respect of person with god for a many a have sin without law shall also perish without law and a many a have sin in the law shall be judged by the law for not the hearer of the law be just before god but the doer of the law shall be justified for when the gentile which have not the law do by nature the thing contain in the law these have not the law be law unto themselves which shew the work of the law write in their heart their conscience also bearing witness and their thought the mean while accuse or else excuse one another in the day when god shall judge the secret of men by jesus christ accord to my gospel behold thou art call jew and restest in the law and makest thy boast of god and knowest his will and approvest the thing that be more excellent be instruct out of the law and art confident that thou thyself art guide of the blind light of them which be in darkness an instructor of the foolish teacher of babe which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law thou therefore which teachest another teachest thou not thyself thou that preachest man should not steal dost thou steal thou that sayest man should not commit adultery dost thou commit adultery thou that abhorrest idol dost thou commit sacrilege thou that makest thy boast of the law through break the law dishonourest thou god for the name of god be blaspheme among the gentile through you a it be write for circumcision verily profiteth if thou keep the law but if thou be breaker of the law thy circumcision be make uncircumcision therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law shall not his uncircumcision be count for circumcision and shall not uncircumcision which be by nature if it fulfil the law judge thee who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law for he be not jew which be one outwardly neither be that circumcision which be outward in the flesh but he be jew which be one inwardly and circumcision be that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose praise be not of men but of god what advantage then hath the jew or what profit be there of circumcision much every way chiefly because that unto them be commit the oracle of god for what if some do not believe shall their unbelief make the faith of god without effect god forbid yea let god be true but every man liar a it be write that thou mightest be justified in thy saying and mightest overcome when thou art judged but if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of god what shall we say be god unrighteous who taketh vengeance speak a man god forbid for then how shall god judge the world for if the truth of god hath more abound through my lie unto his glory why yet be also judged a sinner and not rather a we be slanderously report and a some affirm that we say let u do evil that good may come whose damnation be just what then be we well than they no in no wise for we have before prove both jew and gentile that they be all under sin a it be write there be none righteous no not one there be none that understandeth there be none that seeketh after god they be all go out of the way they be together become unprofitable there be none that doeth good no not one their throat be an open sepulchre with their tongue they have use deceit the poison of asp be under their lip whose mouth be full of curse and bitterness their foot be swift to shed blood destruction and misery be in their way and the way of peace have they not know there be no fear of god before their eye now we know that what thing soever the law saith it saith to them who be under the law that every mouth may be stop and all the world may become guilty before god therefore by the deed of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law be the knowledge of sin but now the righteousness of god without the law be manifest be witness by the law and the prophet even the righteousness of god which be by faith of jesus christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there be no difference for all have sin and come short of the glory of god be justified freely by his grace through the redemption that be in christ jesus whom god hath set forth to be propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sin that be past through the forbearance of god to declare say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in jesus where be boasting then it be exclude by what law of work nay but by the law of faith therefore we conclude that man be justified by faith without the deed of the law be he the god of the jew only be he not also of the gentile yes of the gentile also see it be one god which shall justify the circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith do we then make void the law through faith god forbid yea we establish the law what shall we say then that abraham our father a pertain to the flesh hath found for if abraham be justified by work he hath whereof to glory but not before god for what saith the scripture abraham believe god and it be count unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh be the reward not reckon of grace but of debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith be count for righteousness even a david also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputeth righteousness without work say bless be they whose iniquity be forgiven and whose sin be cover bless be the man to whom the lord will not impute sin cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that faith be reckon to abraham for righteousness how be it then reckon when he be in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision and he receive the sign of circumcision seal of the righteousness of the faith which he have yet be uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcise that righteousness might be impute unto them also and the father of circumcision to them who be not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the step of that faith of our father abraham which he have be yet uncircumcised for the promise that he should be the heir of the world be not to abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith for if they which be of the law be heir faith be make void and the promise make of none effect because the law worketh wrath for where no law be there be no transgression therefore it be of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which be of the law but to that also which be of the faith of abraham who be the father of u all a it be write have make thee father of many nation before him whom he believe even god who quickeneth the dead and calleth those thing which be not a though they be who against hope believe in hope that he might become the father of many nation accord to that which be spoken so shall thy seed be and be not weak in faith he consider not his own body now dead when he be about an hundred year old neither yet the deadness of sarah womb he stagger not at the promise of god through unbelief but be strong in faith give glory to god and be fully persuade that what he have promise he be able also to perform and therefore it be impute to him for righteousness now it be not write for his sake alone that it be impute to him but for u also to whom it shall be impute if we believe on him that raise up jesus our lord from the dead who be deliver for our offence and be raise again for our justification therefore be justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god and not only so but we glory in tribulation also know that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of god be shed abroad in our heart by the holy ghost which be give unto u for when we be yet without strength in due time christ die for the ungodly for scarcely for righteous man will one die yet peradventure for good man some would even dare to die but god commendeth his love toward u in that while we be yet sinner christ die for u much more then be now justified by his blood we shall be save from wrath through him for if when we be enemy we be reconcile to god by the death of his son much more be reconcile we shall be save by his life and not only so but we also joy in god through our lord jesus christ by whom we have now receive the atonement wherefore a by one man sin enter into the world and death by sin and so death pass upon all men for that all have sin for until the law sin be in the world but sin be not impute when there be no law nevertheless death reign from adam to moses even over them that have not sin after the similitude of adam transgression who be the figure of him that be to come but not a the offence so also be the free gift for if through the offence of one many be dead much more the grace of god and the gift by grace which be by one man jesus christ hath abound unto many and not a it be by one that sin so be the gift for the judgment be by one to condemnation but the free gift be of many offence unto justification for if by one man offence death reign by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one jesus christ therefore a by the offence of one judgment come upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift come upon all men unto justification of life for a by one man disobedience many be make sinner so by the obedience of one shall many be make righteous moreover the law enter that the offence might abound but where sin abound grace do much more abound that a sin hath reign unto death even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by jesus christ our lord what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound god forbid how shall we that be dead to sin live any longer therein know ye not that so many of u a be baptize into jesus christ be baptize into his death therefore we be bury with him by baptism into death that like a christ be raise up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life for if we have be plant together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection know this that our old man be crucify with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that be dead be freed from sin now if we be dead with christ we believe that we shall also live with him know that christ be raise from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him for in that he die he die unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto god likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye should obey it in the lust thereof neither yield ye your member a instrument of unrighteousness unto sin but yield yourselves unto god a those that be alive from the dead and your member a instrument of righteousness unto god for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye be not under the law but under grace what then shall we sin because we be not under the law but under grace god forbid know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servant to obey his servant ye be to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness but god be thanked that ye be the servant of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which be deliver you be then make free from sin ye become the servant of righteousness speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for a ye have yield your member servant to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your member servant to righteousness unto holiness for when ye be the servant of sin ye be free from righteousness what fruit have ye then in those thing whereof ye be now ashamed for the end of those thing be death but now be make free from sin and become servant to god ye have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life for the wage of sin be death but the gift of god be eternal life through jesus christ our lord know ye not brother for speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over man a long a he liveth for the woman which hath an husband be bound by the law to her husband so long a he liveth but if the husband be dead she be loose from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be call an adulteress but if her husband be dead she be free from that law so that she be no adulteress though she be married to another man wherefore my brother ye also be become dead to the law by the body of christ that ye should be married to another even to him who be raise from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god for when we be in the flesh the motion of sin which be by the law do work in our member to bring forth fruit unto death but now we be deliver from the law that be dead wherein we be held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter what shall we say then be the law sin god forbid nay have not know sin but by the law for have not know lust except the law have say thou shalt not covet but sin take occasion by the commandment wrought in me all manner of concupiscence for without the law sin be dead for be alive without the law once but when the commandment come sin revive and die and the commandment which be ordain to life found to be unto death for sin take occasion by the commandment deceive me and by it slew me wherefore the law be holy and the commandment holy and just and good be then that which be good make death unto me god forbid but sin that it might appear sin work death in me by that which be good that sin by the commandment might become exceed sinful for we know that the law be spiritual but be carnal sell under sin for that which do allow not for what would that do not but what hate that do if then do that which would not consent unto the law that it be good now then it be no more that do it but sin that dwelleth in me for know that in me that be in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will be present with me but how to perform that which be good find not for the good that would do not but the evil which would not that do now if do that would not it be no more that do it but sin that dwelleth in me find then law that when would do good evil be present with me for delight in the law of god after the inward man but see another law in my member war against the law of my mind and bring me into captivity to the law of sin which be in my member wretched man that be who shall deliver me from the body of this death thank god through jesus christ our lord so then with the mind myself serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin there be therefore now no condemnation to them which be in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath make me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it be weak through the flesh god send his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfil in u who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that be after the flesh do mind the thing of the flesh but they that be after the spirit the thing of the spirit for to be carnally mind be death but to be spiritually mind be life and peace because the carnal mind be enmity against god for it be not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so then they that be in the flesh cannot please god but ye be not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he be none of his and if christ be in you the body be dead because of sin but the spirit be life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raise up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raise up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal body by his spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brother we be debtor not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deed of the body ye shall live for a many a be lead by the spirit of god they be the son of god for ye have not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have receive the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we be the child of god and if child then heir heir of god and joint heir with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorify together for reckon that the suffering of this present time be not worthy to be compare with the glory which shall be reveal in u for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the son of god for the creature be make subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who hath subject the same in hope because the creature itself also shall be deliver from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the child of god for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves wait for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body for we be save by hope but hope that be see be not hope for what man seeth why doth he yet hope for but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmity for we know not what we should pray for a we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for u with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searcheth the heart knoweth what be the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saint accord to the will of god and we know that all thing work together for good to them that love god to them who be the call accord to his purpose for whom he do foreknow he also do predestinate to be conform to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brother moreover whom he do predestinate them he also call and whom he call them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorify what shall we then say to these thing if god be for u who can be against u he that spar not his own son but deliver him up for u all how shall he not with him also freely give u all thing who shall lay any thing to the charge of god elect it be god that justifieth who be he that condemneth it be christ that die yea rather that be risen again who be even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for u who shall separate u from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword a it be write for thy sake we be kill all the day long we be account a sheep for the slaughter nay in all these thing we be more than conqueror through him that love u for be persuade that neither death nor life nor angel nor principality nor power nor thing present nor thing to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate u from the love of god which be in christ jesus our lord say the truth in christ lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the holy ghost that have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart for could wish that myself be accurse from christ for my brother my kinsman accord to the flesh who be israelite to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenant and the give of the law and the service of god and the promise whose be the father and of whom a concern the flesh christ come who be over all god bless for ever amen not a though the word of god hath take none effect for they be not all israel which be of israel neither because they be the seed of abraham be they all child but in isaac shall thy seed be call that be they which be the child of the flesh these be not the child of god but the child of the promise be count for the seed for this be the word of promise at this time will come and sarah shall have son and not only this but when rebecca also have conceive by one even by our father isaac for the child be not yet born neither have do any good or evil that the purpose of god accord to election might stand not of work but of him that calleth it be say unto her the elder shall serve the young a it be write jacob have love but esau have hat what shall we say then be there unrighteousness with god god forbid for he saith to moses will have mercy on whom will have mercy and will have compassion on whom will have compassion so then it be not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of god that sheweth mercy for the scripture saith unto pharaoh even for this same purpose have raise thee up that might shew my power in thee and that my name might be declare throughout all the earth therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he hardeneth thou wilt say then unto me why doth he yet find fault for who hath resist his will nay but man who art thou that repliest against god shall the thing form say to him that form it why hast thou make me thus hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour what if god willing to shew his wrath and to make his power know endure with much longsuffering the vessel of wrath fit to destruction and that he might make know the rich of his glory on the vessel of mercy which he have afore prepared unto glory even u whom he hath call not of the jew only but also of the gentile a he saith also in osee will call them my people which be not my people and her beloved which be not beloved and it shall come to pas that in the place where it be say unto them ye be not my people there shall they be call the child of the living god esaias also crieth concern israel though the number of the child of israel be a the sand of the sea remnant shall be save for he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because short work will the lord make upon the earth and a esaias say before except the lord of sabaoth have left u seed we have be a sodoma and be make like unto gomorrha what shall we say then that the gentile which follow not after righteousness have attain to righteousness even the righteousness which be of faith but israel which follow after the law of righteousness hath not attain to the law of righteousness wherefore because they sought it not by faith but a it be by the work of the law for they stumble at that stumblingstone a it be write behold lay in sion stumblingstone and rock of offence and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed brother my heart desire and prayer to god for israel be that they might be save for bear them record that they have zeal of god but not accord to knowledge for they be ignorant of god righteousness and go about to establish their own righteousness have not submit themselves unto the righteousness of god for christ be the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth for moses describeth the righteousness which be of the law that the man which doeth those thing shall live by them but the righteousness which be of faith speaketh on this wise say not in thine heart who shall ascend into heaven that be to bring christ down from above or who shall descend into the deep that be to bring up christ again from the dead but what saith it the word be nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that be the word of faith which we preach that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raise him from the dead thou shalt be save for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession be make unto salvation for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed for there be no difference between the jew and the greek for the same lord over all be rich unto all that call upon him for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be save how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believe and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent a it be write how beautiful be the foot of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good thing but they have not all obeyed the gospel for esaias saith lord who hath believe our report so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god but say have they not heard yes verily their sound go into all the earth and their word unto the end of the world but say do not israel know first moses saith will provoke you to jealousy by them that be no people and by foolish nation will anger you but esaias be very bold and saith be found of them that sought me not be make manifest unto them that ask not after me but to israel he saith all day long have stretch forth my hand unto disobedient and gainsay people say then hath god cast away his people god forbid for also be an israelite of the seed of abraham of the tribe of benjamin god hath not cast away his people which he foreknew wot ye not what the scripture saith of elia how he maketh intercession to god against israel say lord they have kill thy prophet and digged down thine altar and be left alone and they seek my life but what saith the answer of god unto him have reserve to myself seven thousand men who have not bow the knee to the image of baal even so then at this present time also there be remnant accord to the election of grace and if by grace then be it no more of work otherwise grace be no more grace but if it be of work then it be no more grace otherwise work be no more work what then israel hath not obtain that which he seeketh for but the election hath obtain it and the rest be blind accord a it be write god hath give them the spirit of slumber eye that they should not see and ear that they should not hear unto this day and david saith let their table be make snare and trap and stumblingblock and recompence unto them let their eye be darken that they may not see and bow down their back alway say then have they stumble that they should fall god forbid but rather through their fall salvation be come unto the gentile for to provoke them to jealousy now if the fall of them be the rich of the world and the diminish of them the rich of the gentile how much more their fulness for speak to you gentile inasmuch a be the apostle of the gentile magnify mine office if by any mean may provoke to emulation them which be my flesh and might save some of them for if the cast away of them be the reconcile of the world what shall the receive of them be but life from the dead for if the firstfruit be holy the lump be also holy and if the root be holy so be the branch and if some of the branch be broken off and thou be wild olive tree wert graffed in among them and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree boast not against the branch but if thou boast thou bearest not the root but the root thee thou wilt say then the branch be broken off that might be graffed in well because of unbelief they be broken off and thou standest by faith be not highminded but fear for if god spar not the natural branch take heed l he also spare not thee behold therefore the goodness and severity of god on them which fell severity but toward thee goodness if thou continue in his goodness otherwise thou also shalt be cut off and they also if they abide not still in unbelief shall be graffed in for god be able to graff them in again for if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which be wild by nature and wert graffed contrary to nature into good olive tree how much more shall these which be the natural branch be graffed into their own olive tree for would not brother that ye should be ignorant of this mystery l ye should be wise in your own conceit that blindness in part be happen to israel until the fulness of the gentile be come in and so all israel shall be save a it be write there shall come out of sion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from jacob for this be my covenant unto them when shall take away their sin a concern the gospel they be enemy for your sake but a touch the election they be beloved for the father sake for the gift and call of god be without repentance for a ye in time past have not believe god yet have now obtain mercy through their unbelief even so have these also now not believe that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy for god hath conclude them all in unbelief that he might have mercy upon all the depth of the rich both of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable be his judgment and his way past find out for who hath know the mind of the lord or who hath be his counsellor or who hath first give to him and it shall be recompense unto him again for of him and through him and to him be all thing to whom be glory for ever amen beseech you therefore brother by the mercy of god that ye present your body living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which be your reasonable service and be not conform to this world but be ye transform by the renew of your mind that ye may prove what be that good and acceptable and perfect will of god for say through the grace give unto me to every man that be among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly accord a god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith for a we have many member in one body and all member have not the same office so we be many be one body in christ and every one member one of another have then gift differ accord to the grace that be give to u whether prophecy let u prophesy accord to the proportion of faith or ministry let u wait on our minister or he that teacheth on teach or he that exhorteth on exhortation he that giveth let him do it with simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that sheweth mercy with cheerfulness let love be without dissimulation abhor that which be evil cleave to that which be good be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love in honour prefer one another not slothful in business fervent in spirit serve the lord rejoice in hope patient in tribulation continue instant in prayer distribute to the necessity of saint give to hospitality bless them which persecute you bless and curse not rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep be of the same mind one toward another mind not high thing but condescend to men of low estate be not wise in your own conceit recompense to no man evil for evil provide thing honest in the sight of all men if it be possible a much a lieth in you live peaceably with all men dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give place unto wrath for it be write vengeance be mine will repay saith the lord therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink for in so do thou shalt heap coal of fire on his head be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good let every soul be subject unto the high power for there be no power but of god the power that be be ordain of god whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of god and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation for ruler be not terror to good work but to the evil wilt thou then not be afraid of the power do that which be good and thou shalt have praise of the same for he be the minister of god to thee for good but if thou do that which be evil be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain for he be the minister of god revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil wherefore ye must need be subject not only for wrath but also for conscience sake for for this cause pay ye tribute also for they be god minister attend continually upon this very thing render therefore to all their due tribute to whom tribute be due custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honour to whom honour owe no man any thing but to love one another for he that loveth another hath fulfil the law for this thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness thou shalt not covet and if there be any other commandment it be briefly comprehend in this say namely thou shalt love thy neighbour a thyself love worketh no ill to his neighbour therefore love be the fulfil of the law and that know the time that now it be high time to awake out of sleep for now be our salvation nearer than when we believe the night be far spent the day be at hand let u therefore cast off the work of darkness and let u put on the armour of light let u walk honestly a in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in chamber and wantonness not in strife and envy but put ye on the lord jesus christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfil the lust thereof him that be weak in the faith receive ye but not to doubtful disputation for one believeth that he may eat all thing another who be weak eateth herb let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth for god hath receive him who art thou that judgest another man servant to his own master he standeth or falleth yea he shall be holden up for god be able to make him stand one man esteemeth one day above another another esteemeth every day alike let every man be fully persuade in his own mind he that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the lord and he that regardeth not the day to the lord he doth not regard it he that eateth eateth to the lord for he giveth god thanks and he that eateth not to the lord he eateth not and giveth god thanks for none of u liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself for whether we live we live unto the lord and whether we die we die unto the lord whether we live therefore or die we be the lord for to this end christ both die and rise and revive that he might be lord both of the dead and living but why dost thou judge thy brother or why dost thou set at nought thy brother for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ for it be write a live saith the lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to god so then every one of u shall give account of himself to god let u not therefore judge one another any more but judge this rather that no man put stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother way know and be persuade by the lord jesus that there be nothing unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean to him it be unclean but if thy brother be grieve with thy meat now walkest thou not charitably destroy not him with thy meat for whom christ die let not then your good be evil spoken of for the kingdom of god be not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost for he that in these thing serveth christ be acceptable to god and approve of men let u therefore follow after the thing which make for peace and thing wherewith one may edify another for meat destroy not the work of god all thing indeed be pure but it be evil for that man who eateth with offence it be good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth or be offend or be make weak hast thou faith have it to thyself before god happy be he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth and he that doubteth be damn if he eat because he eateth not of faith for whatsoever be not of faith be sin we then that be strong ought to bear the infirmity of the weak and not to please ourselves let every one of u please his neighbour for his good to edification for even christ pleased not himself but a it be write the reproach of them that reproach thee fell on me for whatsoever thing be write aforetime be write for our learn that we through patience and comfort of the scripture might have hope now the god of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another accord to christ jesus that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify god even the father of our lord jesus christ wherefore receive ye one another a christ also receive u to the glory of god now say that jesus christ be minister of the circumcision for the truth of god to confirm the promise make unto the father and that the gentile might glorify god for his mercy a it be write for this cause will confess to thee among the gentile and sing unto thy name and again he saith rejoice ye gentile with his people and again praise the lord all ye gentile and laud him all ye people and again esaias saith there shall be root of jesse and he that shall rise to reign over the gentile in him shall the gentile trust now the god of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believe that ye may abound in hope through the power of the holy ghost and myself also be persuade of you my brother that ye also be full of goodness fill with all knowledge able also to admonish one another nevertheless brother have write the more boldly unto you in some sort a put you in mind because of the grace that be give to me of god that should be the minister of jesus christ to the gentile minister the gospel of god that the offering up of the gentile might be acceptable be sanctify by the holy ghost have therefore whereof may glory through jesus christ in those thing which pertain to god for will not dare to speak of any of those thing which christ hath not wrought by me to make the gentile obedient by word and deed through mighty sign and wonder by the power of the spirit of god so that from jerusalem and round about unto illyricum have fully preach the gospel of christ yea so have strive to preach the gospel not where christ be name l should build upon another man foundation but a it be write to whom he be not spoken of they shall see and they that have not heard shall understand for which cause also have be much hinder from come to you but now have no more place in these part and have great desire these many year to come unto you whensoever take my journey into spain will come to you for trust to see you in my journey and to be brought on my way thitherward by you if first be somewhat fill with your company but now go unto jerusalem to minister unto the saint for it hath pleased them of macedonia and achaia to make certain contribution for the poor saint which be at jerusalem it hath pleased them verily and their debtor they be for if the gentile have be make partaker of their spiritual thing their duty be also to minister unto them in carnal thing when therefore have perform this and have seal to them this fruit will come by you into spain and be sure that when come unto you shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of christ now beseech you brother for the lord jesus christ sake and for the love of the spirit that ye strive together with me in your prayer to god for me

everlasting god make know to all nation for the obedience of faith to god only wise be glory through jesus christ for ever amen book corinthian paul call to be an apostle of jesus christ through the will of god and sosthenes our brother unto the church of god which be at corinth to them that be sanctify in christ jesus call to be saint with all that in every place call upon the name of jesus christ our lord both their and our grace be unto you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ thank my god always on your behalf for the grace of god which be give you by jesus christ that in every thing ye be enrich by him in all utterance and in all knowledge even a the testimony of christ be confirm in you so that ye come behind in no gift wait for the come of our lord jesus christ who shall also confirm you unto the end that ye may be blameless in the day of our lord jesus christ god be faithful by whom ye be call unto the fellowship of his son jesus christ our lord now beseech you brother by the name of our lord jesus christ that ye all speak the same thing and that there be no division among you but that ye be perfectly join together in the same mind and in the same judgment for it hath be declare unto me of you my brother by them which be of the house of chloe that there be contention among you now this say that every one of you saith be of paul and of apollo and of cephas and of christ be christ divide be paul crucify for you or be ye baptize in the name of paul thank god that baptize none of you but crispus and gaius l any should say that have baptize in mine own name and baptize also the household of stephanas besides know not whether baptize any other for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of word l the cross of christ should be make of none effect for the preach of the cross be to them that perish foolishness but unto u which be save it be the power of god for it be write will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understand of the prudent where be the wise where be the scribe where be the disputer of this world hath not god make foolish the wisdom of this world for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased god by the foolishness of preach to save them that believe for the jew require sign and the greek seek after wisdom but we preach christ crucify unto the jew stumblingblock and unto the greek foolishness but unto them which be call both jew and greek christ the power of god and the wisdom of god because the foolishness of god be wiser than men and the weakness of god be strong than men for ye see your call brother how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble be call but god hath chosen the foolish thing of the world to confound the wise and god hath chosen the weak thing of the world to confound the thing which be mighty and base thing of the world and thing which be despise hath god chosen yea and thing which be not to bring to nought thing that be that no flesh should glory in his presence but of him be ye in christ jesus who of god be make unto u wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption that accord a it be write he that glorieth let him glory in the lord and brother when come to you come not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declare unto you the testimony of god for determine not to know any thing among you save jesus christ and him crucify and be with you in weakness and in fear and in much tremble and my speech and my preach be not with entice word of man wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god howbeit we speak wisdom among them that be perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the prince of this world that come to nought but we speak the wisdom of god in mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordain before the world unto our glory which none of the prince of this world knew for have they know it they would not have crucify the lord of glory but a it be write eye hath not see nor ear heard neither have enter into the heart of man the thing which god hath prepared for them that love him but god hath reveal them unto u by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all thing yea the deep thing of god for what man knoweth the thing of man save the spirit of man which be in him even so the thing of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god now we have receive not the spirit of the world but the spirit which be of god that we might know the thing that be freely give to u of god which thing also we speak not in the word which man wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth compare spiritual thing with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the thing of the spirit of god for they be foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they be spiritually discern but he that be spiritual judgeth all thing yet he himself be judged of no man for who hath know the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of christ and brother could not speak unto you a unto spiritual but a unto carnal even a unto babe in christ have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto ye be not able to bear it neither yet now be ye able for ye be yet carnal for whereas there be among you envy and strife and division be ye not carnal and walk a men for while one saith be of paul and another be of apollo be ye not carnal who then be paul and who be apollo but minister by whom ye believe even a the lord give to every man have plant apollo water but god give the increase so then neither be he that planteth any thing neither he that watereth but god that giveth the increase now he that planteth and he that watereth be one and every man shall receive his own reward accord to his own labour for we be labourer together with god ye be god husbandry ye be god building accord to the grace of god which be give unto me a wise masterbuilder have laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon for other foundation can no man lay than that be laid which be jesus christ now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stone wood hay stubble every man work shall be make manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be reveal by fire and the fire shall try every man work of what sort it be if any man work abide which he hath built thereupon he shall receive reward if any man work shall be burn he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be save yet so a by fire know ye not that ye be the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you if any man defile the temple of god him shall god destroy for the temple of god be holy which temple ye be let no man deceive himself if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world let him become fool that he may be wise for the wisdom of this world be foolishness with god for it be write he taketh the wise in their own craftiness and again the lord knoweth the thought of the wise that they be vain therefore let no man glory in men for all thing be your whether paul or apollo or cephas or the world or life or death or thing present or thing to come all be your and ye be christ and christ be god let man so account of u a of the minister of christ and steward of the mystery of god moreover it be require in steward that man be found faithful but with me it be very small thing that should be judged of you or of man judgment yea judge not mine own self for know nothing by myself yet be not hereby justified but he that judgeth me be the lord therefore judge nothing before the time until the lord come who both will bring to light the hidden thing of darkness and will make manifest the counsel of the heart and then shall every man have praise of god and these thing brother have in figure transfer to myself and to apollo for your sake that ye might learn in u not to think of men above that which be write that no one of you be puffed up for one against another for who maketh thee to differ from another and what hast thou that thou didst not receive now if thou didst receive it why dost thou glory a if thou hadst not receive it now ye be full now ye be rich ye have reign a king without u and would to god ye do reign that we also might reign with you for think that god hath set forth u the apostle last a it be appoint to death for we be make spectacle unto the world and to angel and to men we be fool for christ sake but ye be wise in christ we be weak but ye be strong ye be honourable but we be despise even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and be naked and be buffet and have no certain dwellingplace and labour work with our own hand be revile we bless be persecute we suffer it be defame we intreat we be make a the filth of the world and be the offscouring of all thing unto this day write not these thing to shame you but a my beloved son warn you for though ye have ten thousand instructers in christ yet have ye not many father for in christ jesus have begotten you through the gospel wherefore beseech you be ye follower of me for this cause have sent unto you timotheus who be my beloved son and faithful in the lord who shall bring you into remembrance of my way which be in christ a teach every where in every church now some be puffed up a though would not come to you but will come to you shortly if the lord will and will know not the speech of them which be puffed up but the power for the kingdom of god be not in word but in power what will ye shall come unto you with rod or in love and in the spirit of meekness it be report commonly that there be fornication among you and such fornication a be not so much a name among the gentile that one should have his father wife and ye be puffed up and have not rather mourn that he that hath do this deed might be take away from among you for verily a absent in body but present in spirit have judged already a though be present concern him that hath so do this deed in the name of our lord jesus christ when ye be gather together and my spirit with the power of our lord jesus christ to deliver such an one unto satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be save in the day of the lord jesus your glory be not good know ye not that little leaven leaveneth the whole lump purge out therefore the old leaven that ye may be new lump a ye be unleavened for even christ our passover be sacrifice for u therefore let u keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth write unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicator yet not altogether with the fornicator of this world or with the covetous or extortioner or with idolater for then must ye need go out of the world but now have write unto you not to keep company if any man that be call brother be fornicator or covetous or an idolater or railer or drunkard or an extortioner with such an one no not to eat for what have to do to judge them also that be without do not ye judge them that be within but them that be without god judgeth therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person dare any of you have matter against another go to law before the unjust and not before the saint do ye not know that the saint shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you be ye unworthy to judge the small matter know ye not that we shall judge angel how much more thing that pertain to this life if then ye have judgment of thing pertain to this life set them to judge who be least esteem in the church speak to your shame be it so that there be not wise man among you no not one that shall be able to judge between his brother but brother goeth to law with brother and that before the unbeliever now therefore there be utterly fault among you because ye go to law one with another why do ye not rather take wrong why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defraud nay ye do wrong and defraud and that your brother know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god be not deceive neither fornicator nor idolater nor adulterer nor effeminate nor abuser of themselves with mankind nor thief nor covetous nor drunkard nor revilers nor extortioner shall inherit the kingdom of god and such be some of you but ye be wash but ye be sanctify but ye be justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god all thing be lawful unto me but all thing be not expedient all thing be lawful for me but will not be brought under the power of any meat for the belly and the belly for meat but god shall destroy both it and them now the body be not for fornication but for the lord and the lord for the body and god hath both raise up the lord and will also raise up u by his own power know ye not that your body be the member of christ shall then take the member of christ and make them the member of an harlot god forbid what know ye not that he which be join to an harlot be one body for two saith he shall be one flesh but he that be join unto the lord be one spirit flee fornication every sin that man doeth be without the body but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body what know ye not that your body be the temple of the holy ghost which be in you which ye have of god and ye be not your own for ye be bought with price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which be god now concern the thing whereof ye write unto me it be good for man not to touch woman nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence and likewise also the wife unto the husband the wife hath not power of her own body but the husband and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body but the wife defraud ye not one the other except it be with consent for time that ye may give yourselves to fast and prayer and come together again that satan tempt you not for your incontinency but speak this by permission and not of commandment for would that all men be even a myself but every man hath his proper gift of god one after this manner and another after that say therefore to the unmarried and widow it be good for them if they abide even a but if they cannot contain let them marry for it be well to marry than to burn and unto the married command yet not but the lord let not the wife depart from her husband but and if she depart let her remain unmarried or be reconcile to her husband and let not the husband put away his wife but to the rest speak not the lord if any brother hath wife that believeth not and she be pleased to dwell with him let him not put her away and the woman which hath an husband that believeth not and if he be pleased to dwell with her let her not leave him for the unbelieving husband be sanctify by the wife and the unbelieving wife be sanctify by the husband else be your child unclean but now be they holy but if the unbelieving depart let him depart brother or sister be not under bondage in such case but god hath call u to peace for what knowest thou wife whether thou shalt save thy husband or how knowest thou man whether thou shalt save thy wife but a god hath distribute to every man a the lord hath call every one so let him walk and so ordain in all church be any man call be circumcise let him not become uncircumcised be any call in uncircumcision let him not be circumcise circumcision be nothing and uncircumcision be nothing but the keep of the commandment of god let every man abide in the same call wherein he be call art thou call be servant care not for it but if thou mayest be make free use it rather for he that be call in the lord be servant be the lord freeman likewise also he that be call be free be christ servant ye be bought with price be not ye the servant of men brother let every man wherein he be call therein abide with god now concern virgin have no commandment of the lord yet give my judgment a one that hath obtain mercy of the lord to be faithful suppose therefore that this be good for the present distress say that it be good for man so to be art thou bound unto wife seek not to be loose art thou loose from wife seek not wife but and if thou marry thou hast not sin and if virgin marry she hath not sin nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh but spare you but this say brother the time be short it remaineth that both they that have wife be a though they have none and they that weep a though they wept not and they that rejoice a though they rejoice not and they that buy a though they possess not and they that use this world a not abuse it for the fashion of this world passeth away but would have you without carefulness he that be unmarried careth for the thing that belong to the lord how he may please the lord but he that be married careth for the thing that be of the world how he may please his wife there be difference also between wife and virgin the unmarried woman careth for the thing of the lord that she may be holy both in body and in spirit but she that be married careth for the thing of the world how she may please her husband and this speak for your own profit not that may cast snare upon you but for that which be comely and that ye may attend upon the lord without distraction but if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin if she pas the flower of her age and need so require let him do what he will he sinneth not let them marry nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart have no necessity but hath power over his own will and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin doeth well so then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth well the wife be bound by the law a long a her husband liveth but if her husband be dead she be at liberty to be married to whom she will only in the lord but she be happier if she so abide after my judgment and think also that have the spirit of god now a touch thing offer unto idol we know that we all have knowledge knowledge puffeth up but charity edifieth and if any man think that he knoweth any thing he knoweth nothing yet a he ought to know but if any man love god the same be know of him a concern therefore the eat of those thing that be offer in sacrifice unto idol we know that an idol be nothing in the world and that there be none other god but one for though there be that be call god whether in heaven or in earth a there be god many and lord many but to u there be but one god the father of whom be all thing and we in him and one lord jesus christ by whom be all thing and we by him howbeit there be not in every man that knowledge for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it a thing offer unto an idol and their conscience be weak be defile but meat commendeth u not to god for neither if we eat be we the well neither if we eat not be we the bad but take heed l by any mean this liberty of your become stumblingblock to them that be weak for if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol temple shall not the conscience of him which be weak be embolden to eat those thing which be offer to idol and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom christ die but when ye sin so against the brother and wound their weak conscience ye sin against christ wherefore if meat make my brother to offend will eat no flesh while the world standeth l make my brother to offend be not an apostle be not free have not see jesus christ our lord be not ye my work in the lord if be not an apostle unto others yet doubtless be to you for the seal of mine apostleship be ye in the lord mine answer to them that do examine me be this have we not power to eat and to drink have we not power to lead about sister wife a well a other apostle and a the brother of the lord and cephas or only and barnabas have not we power to forbear work who goeth warfare any time at his own charge who planteth vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof or who feedeth flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock say these thing a man or saith not the law the same also for it be write in the law of moses thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn doth god take care for ox or saith he it altogether for our sake for our sake no doubt this be write that he that ploweth should plow in hope and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope if we have sown unto you spiritual thing be it great thing if we shall reap your carnal thing if others be partaker of this power over you be not we rather nevertheless we have not use this power but suffer all thing l we should hinder the gospel of christ do ye not know that they which minister about holy thing live of the thing of the temple and they which wait at the altar be partaker with the altar even so hath the lord ordain that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel but have use none of these thing neither have write these thing that it should be so do unto me for it be well for me to die than that any man should make my glory void for though preach the gospel have nothing to glory of for necessity be laid upon me yea woe be unto me if preach not the gospel for if do this thing willingly have reward but if against my will dispensation of the gospel be commit unto me what be my reward then verily that when preach the gospel may make the gospel of christ without charge that abuse not my power in the gospel for though be free from all men yet have make myself servant unto all that might gain the more and unto the jew become a jew that might gain the jew to them that be under the law a under the law that might gain them that be under the law to them that be without law a without law be not without law to god but under the law to christ that might gain them that be without law to the weak become a weak that might gain the weak be make all thing to all men that might by all mean save some and this do for the gospel sake that might be partaker thereof with you know ye not that they which run in race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain and every man that striveth for the mastery be temperate in all thing now they do it to obtain corruptible crown but we an incorruptible therefore so run not a uncertainly so fight not a one that beateth the air but keep under my body and bring it into subjection l that by any mean when have preach to others myself should be castaway moreover brother would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our father be under the cloud and all pass through the sea and be all baptize unto moses in the cloud and in the sea and do all eat the same spiritual meat and do all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that follow them and that rock be christ but with many of them god be not well pleased for they be overthrown in the wilderness now these thing be our example to the intent we should not lust after evil thing a they also lust neither be ye idolater a be some of them a it be write the people sat down to eat and drink and rise up to play neither let u commit fornication a some of them commit and fell in one day three and twenty thousand neither let u tempt christ a some of them also tempt and be destroyed of serpent neither murmur ye a some of them also murmur and be destroyed of the destroyer now all these thing happen unto them for ensamples and they be write for our admonition upon whom the end of the world be come wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed l he fall there hath no temptation take you but such a be common to man but god be faithful who will not suffer you to be tempt above that ye be able but will with the temptation also make way to escape that ye may be able to bear it wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry speak a to wise men judge ye what say the cup of blessing which we bless be it not the communion of the blood of christ the bread which we break be it not the communion of the body of christ for we be many be one bread and one body for we be all partaker of that one bread behold israel after the flesh be not they which eat of the sacrifice partaker of the altar what say then that the idol be any thing or that which be offer in sacrifice to idol be any thing but say that the thing which the gentile sacrifice they sacrifice to devil and not to god and would not that ye should have fellowship with devil ye cannot drink the cup of the lord and the cup of devil ye cannot be partaker of the lord table and of the table of devil do we provoke the lord to jealousy be we strong than he all thing be lawful for me but all thing be not expedient all thing be lawful for me but all thing edify not let no man seek his own but every man another wealth whatsoever be sell in the shamble that eat ask no question for conscience sake for the earth be the lord and the fulness thereof if any of them that believe not bid you to feast and ye be dispose to go whatsoever be set before you eat ask no question for conscience sake but if any man say unto you this be offer in sacrifice unto idol eat not for his sake that shew it and for conscience sake for the earth be the lord and the fulness thereof conscience say not thine own but of the other for why be my liberty judged of another man conscience for if by grace be partaker why be evil spoken of for that for which give thanks whether therefore ye eat or drink or whatsoever ye do do all to the glory of god give none offence neither to the jew nor to the gentile nor to the church of god even a please all men in all thing not seek mine own profit but the profit of many that they may be save be ye follower of me even a also be of christ now praise you brother that ye remember me in all thing and keep the ordinance a deliver them to you but would have you know that the head of every man be christ and the head of the woman be the man and the head of christ be god every man pray or prophesy have his head cover dishonoureth his head but every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head for that be even all one a if she be shaven for if the woman be not cover let her also be shorn but if it be shame for woman to be shorn or shaven let her be cover for man indeed ought not to cover his head forasmuch a he be the image and glory of god but the woman be the glory of the man for the man be not of the woman but the woman of the man neither be the man create for the woman but the woman for the man for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angel nevertheless neither be the man without the woman neither the woman without the man in the lord for a the woman be of the man even so be the man also by the woman but all thing of god judge in yourselves be it comely that woman pray unto god uncovered doth not even nature itself teach you that if man have long hair it be shame unto him but if woman have long hair it be glory to her for her hair be give her for cover but if any man seem to be contentious we have no such custom neither the church of god now in this that declare unto you praise you not that ye come together not for the well but for the bad for first of all when ye come together in the church hear that there be division among you and partly believe it for there must be also heresy among you that they which be approve may be make manifest among you when ye come together therefore into one place this be not to eat the lord supper for in eat every one taketh before other his own supper and one be hungry and another be drunken what have ye not house to eat and to drink in or despise ye the church of god and shame them that have not what shall say to you shall praise you in this praise you not for have receive of the lord that which also deliver unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he be betrayed take bread and when he have give thanks he brake it and say take eat this be my body which be broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he take the cup when he have sup say this cup be the new testament in my blood this do ye a oft a ye drink it in remembrance of me for a often a ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do shew the lord death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discern the lord body for this cause many be weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we be judged we be chasten of the lord that we should not be condemn with the world wherefore my brother when ye come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will set in order when come now concern spiritual gift brother would not have you ignorant ye know that ye be gentile carry away unto these dumb idol even a ye be lead wherefore give you to understand that no man speak by the spirit of god calleth jesus accurse and that no man can say that jesus be the lord but by the holy ghost now there be diversity of gift but the same spirit and there be difference of administration but the same lord and there be diversity of operation but it be the same god which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit be give to every man to profit withal for to one be give by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit to another the gift of heal by the same spirit to another the work of miracle to another prophecy to another discern of spirit to another diver kind of tongue to another the interpretation of tongue but all these worketh that one and the selfsame spirit divide to every man severally a he will for a the body be one and hath many member and all the member of that one body be many be one body so also be christ for by one spirit be we all baptize into one body whether we be jew or gentile whether we be bond or free and have be all make to drink into one spirit for the body be not one member but many if the foot shall say because be not the hand be not of the body be it therefore not of the body and if the ear shall say because be not the eye be not of the body be it therefore not of the body if the whole body be an eye where be the hearing if the whole be hearing where be the smell but now hath god set the member every one of them in the body a it hath pleased him and if they be all one member where be the body but now be they many member yet but one body and the eye cannot say unto the hand have no need of thee nor again the head to the foot have no need of you nay much more those member of the body which seem to be more feeble be necessary and those member of the body which we think to be less honourable upon these we bestow more abundant honour and our uncomely part have more abundant comeliness for our comely part have no need but god hath temper the body together have give more abundant honour to that part which lack that there should be no schism in the body but that the member should have the same care one for another and whether one member suffer all the member suffer with it or one member be honour all the member rejoice with it now ye be the body of christ and member in particular and god hath set some in the church first apostle secondarily prophet thirdly teacher after that miracle then gift of healing help government diversity of tongue be all apostle be all prophet be all teacher be all worker of miracle have all the gift of heal do all speak with tongue do all interpret but covet earnestly the best gift and yet shew unto you more excellent way though speak with the tongue of men and of angel and have not charity be become a sound brass or tinkle cymbal and though have the gift of prophecy and understand all mystery and all knowledge and though have all faith so that could remove mountain and have not charity be nothing and though bestow all my good to feed the poor and though give my body to be burn and have not charity it profiteth me nothing charity suffereth long and be kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself be not puffed up doth not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own be not easily provoke thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all thing believeth all thing hopeth all thing endureth all thing charity never faileth but whether there be prophecy they shall fail whether there be tongue they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which be perfect be come then that which be in part shall be do away when be child spake a child understood a child thought a child but when become man put away childish thing for now we see through glass darkly but then face to face now know in part but then shall know even a also be know and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the great of these be charity follow after charity and desire spiritual gift but rather that ye may prophesy for he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men but unto god for no man understandeth him howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mystery but he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification and exhortation and comfort he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself but he that prophesieth edifieth the church would that ye all spake with tongue but rather that ye prophesy for great be he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongue except he interpret that the church may receive edify now brother if come unto you speak with tongue what shall profit you except shall speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge or by prophesy or by doctrine and even thing without life give sound whether pipe or harp except they give distinction in the sound how shall it be know what be piped or harped for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle so likewise ye except ye utter by the tongue word easy to be understood how shall it be know what be spoken for ye shall speak into the air there be it may be so many kind of voice in the world and none of them be without signification therefore if know not the meaning of the voice shall be unto him that speaketh barbarian and he that speaketh shall be barbarian unto me even so ye forasmuch a ye be zealous of spiritual gift seek that ye may excel to the edify of the church wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret for if pray in an unknown tongue my spirit prayeth but my understand be unfruitful what be it then will pray with the spirit and will pray with the understand also will sing with the spirit and will sing with the understand also else when thou shalt bless with the spirit how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say amen at thy give of thanks see he understandeth not what thou sayest for thou verily givest thanks well but the other be not edify thank my god speak with tongue more than ye all yet in the church have rather speak five word with my understand that by my voice might teach others also than ten thousand word in an unknown tongue brother be not child in understand howbeit in malice be ye child but in understand be men in the law it be write with men of other tongue and other lip will speak unto this people and yet for all that will they not hear me saith the lord wherefore tongue be for sign not to them that believe but to them that believe not but prophesy serveth not for them that believe not but for them which believe if therefore the whole church be come together into one place and all speak with tongue and there come in those that be unlearned or unbeliever will they not say that ye be mad but if all prophesy and there come in one that believeth not or one unlearned he be convince of all he be judged of all and thus be the secret of his heart make manifest and so fall down on his face he will worship god and report that god be in you of truth how be it then brother when ye come together every one of you hath psalm hath doctrine hath tongue hath revelation hath an interpretation let all thing be do unto edify if any man speak in an unknown tongue let it be by two or at the most by three and that by course and let one interpret but if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the church and let him speak to himself and to god let the prophet speak two or three and let the other judge if any thing be reveal to another that sitteth by let the first hold his peace for ye may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be comfort and the spirit of the prophet be subject to the prophet for god be not the author of confusion but of peace a in all church of the saint let your woman keep silence in the church for it be not permit unto them to speak but they be command to be under obedience a also saith the law and if they will learn any thing let them ask their husband at home for it be shame for woman to speak in the church what come the word of god out from you or come it unto you only if any man think himself to be prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the thing that write unto you be the commandment of the lord but if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant wherefore brother covet to prophesy and forbid not to speak with tongue let all thing be do decently and in order moreover brother declare unto you the gospel which preach unto you which also ye have receive and wherein ye stand by which also ye be save if ye keep in memory what preach unto you unless ye have believe in vain for deliver unto you first of all that which also receive how that christ die for our sin accord to the scripture and that he be bury and that he rise again the third day accord to the scripture and that he be see of cephas then of the twelve after that he be see of above five hundred brother at once of whom the great part remain unto this present but some be fall asleep after that he be see of james then of all the apostle and last of all he be see of me also a of one born out of due time for be the least of the apostle that be not meet to be call an apostle because persecute the church of god but by the grace of god be what be and his grace which be bestow upon me be not in vain but labour more abundantly than they all yet not but the grace of god which be with me therefore whether it be or they so we preach and so ye believe now if christ be preach that he rise from the dead how say some among you that there be no resurrection of the dead but if there be no resurrection of the dead then be christ not risen and if christ be not risen then be our preach vain and your faith be also vain yea and we be found false witness of god because we have testify of god that he raise up christ whom he raise not up if so be that the dead rise not for if the dead rise not then be not christ raise and if christ be not raise your faith be vain ye be yet in your sin then they also which be fall asleep in christ be perish if in this life only we have hope in christ we be of all men most miserable but now be christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept for since by man come death by man come also the resurrection of the dead for a in adam all die even so in christ shall all be make alive but every man in his own order christ the firstfruits afterward they that be christ at his come then cometh the end when he shall have deliver up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power for he must reign till he hath put all enemy under his foot the last enemy that shall be destroyed be death for he hath put all thing under his foot but when he saith all thing be put under him it be manifest that he be except which do put all thing under him and when all thing shall be subdue unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all thing under him that god may be all in all else what shall they do which be baptize for the dead if the dead rise not at all why be they then baptize for the dead and why stand we in jeopardy every hour protest by your rejoice which have in christ jesus our lord die daily if after the manner of men have fought with beast at ephesus what advantageth it me if the dead rise not let u eat and drink for to morrow we die be not deceive evil communication corrupt good manner awake to righteousness and sin not for some have not the knowledge of god speak this to your shame but some man will say how be the dead raise up and with what body do they come thou fool that which thou sowest be not quicken except it die and that which thou sowest thou sowest not that body that shall be but bare grain it may chance of wheat or of some other grain but god giveth it body a it hath pleased him and to every seed his own body all flesh be not the same flesh but there be one kind of flesh of men another flesh of beast another of fish and another of bird there be also celestial body and body terrestrial but the glory of the celestial be one and the glory of the terrestrial be another there be one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the star for one star differeth from another star in glory so also be the resurrection of the dead it be sown in corruption it be raise in incorruption it be sown in dishonour it be raise in glory it be sown in weakness it be raise in power it be sown natural body it be raise spiritual body there be natural body and there be spiritual body and so it be write the first man adam be make living soul the last adam be make quicken spirit howbeit that be not first which be spiritual but that which be natural and afterward that which be spiritual the first man be of the earth earthy the second man be the lord from heaven a be the earthy such be they also that be earthy and a be the heavenly such be they also that be heavenly and a we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heavenly now this say brother that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither doth corruption inherit incorruption behold shew you mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be change in moment in the twinkle of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raise incorruptible and we shall be change for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pas the say that be write death be swallow up in victory death where be thy sting grave where be thy victory the sting of death be sin and the strength of sin be the law but thanks be to god which giveth u the victory through our lord jesus christ therefore my beloved brother be ye stedfast unmoveable always abound in the work of the lord forasmuch a ye know that your labour be not in vain in the lord now concern the collection for the saint a have give order to the church of galatia even so do ye upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store a god hath prosper him that there be no gathering when come and when come whomsoever ye shall approve by your

and it may be that will abide yea and winter with you that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever go for will not see you now by the way but trust to tarry while with you if the lord permit but will tarry at ephesus until pentecost for great door and effectual be open unto me and there be many adversary now if timotheus come see that he may be with you without fear for he worketh the work of the lord a also do let no man therefore despise him but conduct him forth in peace that he may come unto me for look for him with the brother a touch our brother apollo greatly desire him to come unto you with the brother but his will be not at all to come at this time but he will come when he shall have convenient time watch ye stand fast in the faith quit you like men be strong let all your thing be do with charity beseech you brother ye know the house of stephanas that it be the firstfruits of achaia and that they have addict themselves to the ministry of the saint that ye submit yourselves unto such and to every one that helpeth with u and laboureth be glad of the come of stephanas and fortunatus and achaicus for that which be lack on your part they have supply for they have refresh my spirit and your therefore acknowledge ye them that be such the church of asia salute you aquila and priscilla salute you much in the lord with the church that be in their house all the brother greet you greet ye one another with an holy kiss the salutation of me paul with mine own hand if any man love not the lord jesus christ let him be anathema maranatha the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you my love be with you all in christ jesus amen book ii corinthian paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god and timothy our brother unto the church of god which be at corinth with all the saint which be in all achaia grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ bless be god even the father of our lord jesus christ the father of mercy and the god of all comfort who comforteth u in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which be in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves be comfort of god for a the suffering of christ abound in u so our consolation also aboundeth by christ and whether we be afflict it be for your consolation and salvation which be effectual in the endure of the same suffering which we also suffer or whether we be comfort it be for your consolation and salvation and our hope of you be stedfast know that a ye be partaker of the suffering so shall ye be also of the consolation for we would not brother have you ignorant of our trouble which come to u in asia that we be press out of measure above strength insomuch that we despair even of life but we have the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in god which raiseth the dead who deliver u from so great death and doth deliver in whom we trust that he will yet deliver u ye also help together by prayer for u that for the gift bestow upon u by the mean of many person thanks may be give by many on our behalf for our rejoice be this the testimony of our conscience that in simplicity and godly sincerity not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace of god we have have our conversation in the world and more abundantly to you ward for we write none other thing unto you than what ye read or acknowledge and trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end a also ye have acknowledge u in part that we be your rejoice even a ye also be our in the day of the lord jesus and in this confidence be mind to come unto you before that ye might have second benefit and to pas by you into macedonia and to come again out of macedonia unto you and of you to be brought on my way toward judaea when therefore be thus mind do use lightness or the thing that purpose do purpose accord to the flesh that with me there should be yea yea and nay nay but a god be true our word toward you be not yea and nay for the son of god jesus christ who be preach among you by u even by me and silvanus and timotheus be not yea and nay but in him be yea for all the promise of god in him be yea and in him amen unto the glory of god by u now he which stablisheth u with you in christ and hath anoint u be god who hath also seal u and give the earnest of the spirit in our heart moreover call god for record upon my soul that to spare you come not a yet unto corinth not for that we have dominion over your faith but be helper of your joy for by faith ye stand but determine this with myself that would not come again to you in heaviness for if make you sorry who be he then that maketh me glad but the same which be make sorry by me and write this same unto you l when come should have sorrow from them of whom ought to rejoice have confidence in you all that my joy be the joy of you all for out of much affliction and anguish of heart write unto you with many tear not that ye should be grieve but that ye might know the love which have more abundantly unto you but if any have cause grief he hath not grieve me but in part that may not overcharge you all sufficient to such man be this punishment which be inflict of many so that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him and comfort him l perhaps such one should be swallow up with overmuch sorrow wherefore beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him for to this end also do write that might know the proof of you whether ye be obedient in all thing to whom ye forgive any thing forgive also for if forgave any thing to whom forgave it for your sake forgave it in the person of christ l satan should get an advantage of u for we be not ignorant of his device furthermore when come to troas to preach christ gospel and door be open unto me of the lord have no rest in my spirit because found not titus my brother but take my leave of them go from thence into macedonia now thanks be unto god which always causeth u to triumph in christ and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by u in every place for we be unto god sweet savour of christ in them that be save and in them that perish to the one we be the savour of death unto death and to the other the savour of life unto life and who be sufficient for these thing for we be not a many which corrupt the word of god but a of sincerity but a of god in the sight of god speak we in christ do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we a some others epistle of commendation to you or letter of commendation from you ye be our epistle write in our heart know and read of all men forasmuch a ye be manifestly declare to be the epistle of christ minister by u write not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in table of stone but in fleshy table of the heart and such trust have we through christ to god ward not that we be sufficient of ourselves to think any thing a of ourselves but our sufficiency be of god who also hath make u able minister of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life but if the ministration of death write and engraven in stone be glorious so that the child of israel could not stedfastly behold the face of moses for the glory of his countenance which glory be to be do away how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious for if the ministration of condemnation be glory much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory for even that which be make glorious have no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that excelleth for if that which be do away be glorious much more that which remaineth be glorious see then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech and not a moses which put vail over his face that the child of israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which be abolish but their mind be blind for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament which vail be do away in christ but even unto this day when moses be read the vail be upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the vail shall be take away now the lord be that spirit and where the spirit of the lord be there be liberty but we all with open face beholding a in glass the glory of the lord be change into the same image from glory to glory even a by the spirit of the lord therefore see we have this ministry a we have receive mercy we faint not but have renounce the hidden thing of dishonesty not walk in craftiness nor handle the word of god deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commend ourselves to every man conscience in the sight of god but if our gospel be hid it be hid to them that be lose in whom the god of this world hath blind the mind of them which believe not l the light of the glorious gospel of christ who be the image of god should shine unto them for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servant for jesus sake for god who command the light to shine out of darkness hath shin in our heart to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ but we have this treasure in earthen vessel that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of u we be troubled on every side yet not distressed we be perplexed but not in despair persecute but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the die of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be make manifest in our body for we which live be alway deliver unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be make manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in u but life in you we have the same spirit of faith accord a it be write believe and therefore have spoken we also believe and therefore speak know that he which raise up the lord jesus shall raise up u also by jesus and shall present u with you for all thing be for your sake that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of god for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man be renew day by day for our light affliction which be but for moment worketh for u far more exceed and eternal weight of glory while we look not at the thing which be see but at the thing which be not see for the thing which be see be temporal but the thing which be not see be eternal for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolve we have building of god an house not make with hand eternal in the heaven for in this we groan earnestly desire to be clothed upon with our house which be from heaven if so be that be clothed we shall not be found naked for we that be in this tabernacle do groan be burden not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallow up of life now he that hath wrought u for the selfsame thing be god who also hath give unto u the earnest of the spirit therefore we be always confident know that whilst we be at home in the body we be absent from the lord for we walk by faith not by sight we be confident say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the lord wherefore we labour that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that every one may receive the thing do in his body accord to that he hath do whether it be good or bad know therefore the terror of the lord we persuade men but we be make manifest unto god and trust also be make manifest in your conscience for we commend not ourselves again unto you but give you occasion to glory on our behalf that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance and not in heart for whether we be beside ourselves it be to god or whether we be sober it be for your cause for the love of christ constraineth u because we thus judge that if one die for all then be all dead and that he die for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which die for them and rise again wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yea though we have know christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more therefore if any man be in christ he be new creature old thing be pass away behold all thing be become new and all thing be of god who hath reconcile u to himself by jesus christ and hath give to u the ministry of reconciliation to wit that god be in christ reconcile the world unto himself not impute their trespass unto them and hath commit unto u the word of reconciliation now then we be ambassador for christ a though god do beseech you by u we pray you in christ stead be ye reconcile to god for he hath make him to be sin for u who knew no sin that we might be make the righteousness of god in him we then a worker together with him beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of god in vain for he saith have heard thee in time accepted and in the day of salvation have succour thee behold now be the accepted time behold now be the day of salvation give no offence in any thing that the ministry be not blame but in all thing approve ourselves a the minister of god in much patience in affliction in necessity in distress in stripe in imprisonment in tumult in labour in watching in fasting by pureness by knowledge by longsuffering by kindness by the holy ghost by love unfeigned by the word of truth by the power of god by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left by honour and dishonour by evil report and good report a deceiver and yet true a unknown and yet well know a die and behold we live a chasten and not kill a sorrowful yet alway rejoice a poor yet make many rich a have nothing and yet possess all thing ye corinthian our mouth be open unto you our heart be enlarge ye be not straiten in u but ye be straiten in your own bowel now for recompence in the same speak a unto my child be ye also enlarge be ye not unequally yoked together with unbeliever for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness and what concord hath christ with belial or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel and what agreement hath the temple of god with idol for ye be the temple of the living god a god hath say will dwell in them and walk in them and will be their god and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and will receive you and will be father unto you and ye shall be my son and daughter saith the lord almighty have therefore these promise dearly beloved let u cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfect holiness in the fear of god receive u we have wrong no man we have corrupt no man we have defraud no man speak not this to condemn you for have say before that ye be in our heart to die and live with you great be my boldness of speech toward you great be my glory of you be fill with comfort be exceed joyful in all our tribulation for when we be come into macedonia our flesh have no rest but we be troubled on every side without be fighting within be fear nevertheless god that comforteth those that be cast down comfort u by the come of titus and not by his come only but by the consolation wherewith he be comfort in you when he told u your earnest desire your mourn your fervent mind toward me so that rejoice the more for though make you sorry with letter do not repent though do repent for perceive that the same epistle hath make you sorry though it be but for season now rejoice not that ye be make sorry but that ye sorrow to repentance for ye be make sorry after godly manner that ye might receive damage by u in nothing for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repent of but the sorrow of the world worketh death for behold this selfsame thing that ye sorrow after godly sort what carefulness it wrought in you yea what clearing of yourselves yea what indignation yea what fear yea what vehement desire yea what zeal yea what revenge in all thing ye have approve yourselves to be clear in this matter wherefore though write unto you do it not for his cause that have do the wrong nor for his cause that suffer wrong but that our care for you in the sight of god might appear unto you therefore we be comfort in your comfort yea and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of titus because his spirit be refresh by you all for if have boast any thing to him of you be not ashamed but a we spake all thing to you in truth even so our boasting which make before titus be found truth and his inward affection be more abundant toward you whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all how with fear and tremble ye receive him rejoice therefore that have confidence in you in all thing moreover brother we do you to wit of the grace of god bestow on the church of macedonia how that in great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abound unto the rich of their liberality for to their power bear record yea and beyond their power they be willing of themselves pray u with much intreaty that we would receive the gift and take upon u the fellowship of the minister to the saint and this they do not a we hop but first give their own self to the lord and unto u by the will of god insomuch that we desire titus that a he have begin so he would also finish in you the same grace also therefore a ye abound in every thing in faith and utterance and knowledge and in all diligence and in your love to u see that ye abound in this grace also speak not by commandment but by occasion of the forwardness of others and to prove the sincerity of your love for ye know the grace of our lord jesus christ that though he be rich yet for your sake he become poor that ye through his poverty might be rich and herein give my advice for this be expedient for you who have begin before not only to do but also to be forward year ago now therefore perform the do of it that a there be readiness to will so there may be performance also out of that which ye have for if there be first willing mind it be accepted accord to that man hath and not accord to that he hath not for mean not that other men be ease and ye burden but by an equality that now at this time your abundance may be supply for their want that their abundance also may be supply for your want that there may be equality a it be write he that have gather much have nothing over and he that have gather little have no lack but thanks be to god which put the same earnest care into the heart of titus for you for indeed he accepted the exhortation but be more forward of his own accord he go unto you and we have sent with him the brother whose praise be in the gospel throughout all the church and not that only but who be also chosen of the church to travel with u with this grace which be administer by u to the glory of the same lord and declaration of your ready mind avoid this that no man should blame u in this abundance which be administer by u provide for honest thing not only in the sight of the lord but also in the sight of men and we have sent with them our brother whom we have oftentimes prove diligent in many thing but now much more diligent upon the great confidence which have in you whether any do enquire of titus he be my partner and fellowhelper concern you or our brother be enquire of they be the messenger of the church and the glory of christ wherefore shew ye to them and before the church the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf for a touch the minister to the saint it be superfluous for me to write to you for know the forwardness of your mind for which boast of you to them of macedonia that achaia be ready year ago and your zeal hath provoke very many yet have sent the brother l our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf that a say ye may be ready l haply if they of macedonia come with me and find you unprepared we that we say not ye should be ashamed in this same confident boasting therefore thought it necessary to exhort the brother that they would go before unto you and make up beforehand your bounty whereof ye have notice before that the same might be ready a matter of bounty and not a of covetousness but this say he which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully every man accord a he purposeth in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity for god loveth cheerful giver and god be able to make all grace abound toward you that ye always have all sufficiency in all thing may abound to every good work a it be write he hath disperse abroad he hath give to the poor his righteousness remaineth for ever now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food and multiply your seed sown and increase the fruit of your righteousness be enrich in every thing to all bountifulness which causeth through u thanksgiving to god for the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saint but be abundant also by many thanksgiving unto god while by the experiment of this ministration they glorify god for your profess subjection unto the gospel of christ and for your liberal distribution unto them and unto all men and by their prayer for you which long after you for the exceed grace of god in you thanks be unto god for his unspeakable gift now paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of christ who in presence be base among you but be absent be bold toward you but beseech you that may not be bold when be present with that confidence wherewith think to be bold against some which think of u a if we walk accord to the flesh for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapon of our warfare be not carnal but mighty through god to the pull down of strong hold cast down imagination and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ and have in readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience be fulfil do ye look on thing after the outward appearance if any man trust to himself that he be christ let him of himself think this again that a he be christ even so be we christ for though should boast somewhat more of our authority which the lord hath give u for edification and not for your destruction should not be ashamed that may not seem a if would terrify you by letter for his letter say they be weighty and powerful but his bodily presence be weak and his speech contemptible let such an one think this that such a we be in word by letter when we be absent such will we be also in deed when we be present for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves but they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves among themselves be not wise but we will not boast of thing without our measure but accord to the measure of the rule which god hath distribute to u measure to reach even unto you for we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure a though we reach not unto you for we be come a far a to you also in preach the gospel of christ not boasting of thing without our measure that be of other men labour but have hope when your faith be increase that we shall be enlarge by you accord to our rule abundantly to preach the gospel in the region beyond you and not to boast in another man line of thing make ready to our hand but he that glorieth let him glory in the lord for not he that commendeth himself be approve but whom the lord commendeth would to god ye could bear with me little in my folly and indeed bear with me for be jealous over you with godly jealousy for have espouse you to one husband that may present you a chaste virgin to christ but fear l by any mean a the serpent beguile eve through his subtilty so your mind should be corrupt from the simplicity that be in christ for if he that cometh preacheth another jesus whom we have not preach or if ye receive another spirit which ye have not receive or another gospel which ye have not accepted ye might well bear with him for suppose be not whit behind the very chiefest apostle but though be rude in speech yet not in knowledge but we have be throughly make manifest among you in all thing have commit an offence in abase myself that ye might be exalt because have preach to you the gospel of god freely robbed other church take wage of them to do you service and when be present with you and want be chargeable to no man for that which be lack to me the brother which come from macedonia supply and in all thing have kept myself from be burdensome unto you and so will keep myself a the truth of christ be in me no man shall stop me of this boasting in the region of achaia wherefore because love you not god knoweth but what do that will do that may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion that wherein they glory they may be found even a we for such be false apostle deceitful worker transform themselves into the apostle of christ and no marvel for satan himself be transform into an angel of light therefore it be no great thing if his minister also be transform a the minister of righteousness whose end shall be accord to their work say again let no man think me fool if otherwise yet a fool receive me that may boast myself little that which speak speak it not after the lord but a it be foolishly in this confidence of boasting see that many glory after the flesh will glory also for ye suffer fool gladly see ye yourselves be wise for ye suffer if man bring you into bondage if man devour you if man take of you if man exalt himself if man smite you on the face speak a concern reproach a though we have be weak howbeit whereinsoever any be bold speak foolishly be bold also be they hebrew so be be they israelite so be be they the seed of abraham so be be they minister of christ speak a fool be more in labour more abundant in stripe above measure in prison more frequent in death oft of the jew five time receive forty stripe save one thrice be beaten with rod once be stone thrice suffer shipwreck night and day have be in the deep in journeying often in peril of water in peril of robber in peril by mine own countryman in peril by the heathen in peril in the city in peril in the wilderness in peril in the sea in peril among false brother in weariness and painfulness in watching often in hunger and thirst in fasting often in cold and nakedness beside those thing that be without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the church who be weak and be not weak who be offend and burn not if must need glory will glory of the thing which concern mine infirmity the god and father of our lord jesus christ which be bless for evermore knoweth that lie not in damascus the governor under aretas the king kept the city of the damascene with garrison desirous to apprehend me and through window in basket be let down by the wall and escape his hand it be not expedient for me doubtless to glory will come to vision and revelation of the lord knew man in christ above fourteen year ago whether in the body cannot tell or whether out of the body cannot tell god knoweth such an one caught up to the third heaven and knew such man whether in the body or out of the body cannot tell god knoweth how that he be caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable word which it be not lawful for man to utter of such an one will glory yet of myself will not glory but in mine infirmity for though would desire to glory shall not be fool for will say the truth but now forbear l any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of me and l should be exalt above measure through the abundance of the revelation there be give to me thorn in the flesh the messenger of satan to buffet me l should be exalt above measure for this thing besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me and he say unto me my grace be sufficient for thee for my strength be make perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will rather glory in my infirmity that the power of christ may rest upon me therefore take pleasure in infirmity in reproach in necessity in persecution in distress for christ sake for when be weak then be strong be become fool in glory ye have compel me for ought to have be commend of you for in nothing be behind the very chiefest apostle though be nothing truly the sign of an apostle be wrought among you in all patience in sign and wonder and mighty deed for what be it wherein ye be inferior to other church except it be that myself be not burdensome to you forgive me this wrong behold the third time be ready to come to you and will not be burdensome to you for seek not your but you for the child ought not to lay up for the parent but the parent for the child and will very gladly spend and be spent for you though the more abundantly love you the less be love but be it so do not burden you nevertheless be crafty caught you with guile do make gain of you by any of them whom sent unto you desire titus and with him sent brother do titus make gain of you walk we not in the same spirit walk we not in the same step again think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you we speak before god in christ but we do all thing dearly beloved for your edify for fear l when come shall not find you such a would and that shall be found unto you such a ye would not l there be debate envyings wrath strife backbitings whispering swelling tumult and l when come again my god will humble me among you and that shall bewail many which have sin already and have not repent of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have commit this be the third time be come to you in the mouth of two or three witness shall every word be establish told you before and foretell you a if be present the second time and be absent now write to them which heretofore have sin and to all other that if come again will not spare since ye seek proof of christ speak in me which to you ward be not weak but be mighty in you for though he be crucify through weakness yet he liveth by the power of god for we also be weak in him but we shall live with him by the power of god toward you examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith prove your own self know ye not your own self how that jesus christ be in you except ye be reprobate but trust that ye shall know that we be not reprobate now pray to god that ye do no evil not that we should appear approve but that ye should do that which be honest though we be a reprobate for we can do nothing against the truth but for the truth for we be glad when we be weak and ye be strong and this also we wish even your perfection therefore write these thing be absent l be present should use sharpness accord to the power which the lord hath give me to edification and not to destruction finally brother farewell be perfect be of good comfort be of one mind live in peace and the god of love and peace shall be with you greet one another with an holy kiss all the saint salute you the grace of the lord jesus christ and the love of god and the communion of the holy ghost be with you all amen book galatian paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by jesus christ and god the father who raise him from the dead and all the brother which be with me unto the church of galatia grace be to you and peace from god the father and from our lord jesus christ who give himself for our sin that he might deliver u from this present evil world accord to the will of god and our father to whom be glory for ever and ever amen marvel that ye be so soon remove from him that call you into the grace of christ unto another gospel which be not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preach unto you let him be accurse a we say before so say now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have receive let him be accurse for do now persuade men or god or do seek to please men for if yet pleased men should not be the servant of christ but certify you brother that the gospel which be preach of me be not after man for neither receive it of man neither be taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the jew religion how that beyond measure persecute the church of god and waste it and profit in the jew religion above many my equal in mine own nation be more exceedingly zealous of the tradition of my father but when it pleased god who separate me from my mother womb and call me by his grace to reveal his son in me that might preach him among the heathen immediately confer not with flesh and blood neither go up to jerusalem to them which be apostle before me but go into arabia and return again unto damascus then after three year go up to jerusalem to see peter and abode with him fifteen day but other of the apostle saw none save james the lord brother now the thing which write unto you behold before god lie not afterwards come into the region of syria and cilicia and be unknown by face unto the church of judaea which be in christ but they have heard only that he which persecute u in time past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed and they glorify god in me then fourteen year after go up again to jerusalem with barnabas and take titus with me also and go up by revelation and communicate unto them that gospel which preach among the gentile but privately to them which be of reputation l by any mean should run or have run in vain but neither titus who be with me be greek be compel to be circumcise and that because of false brother unawares brought in who come in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in christ jesus that they might bring u into bondage to whom we give place by subjection no not for an hour that the truth of the gospel might continue with you but of these who seem to be somewhat whatsoever they be it maketh no matter to me god accepteth no man person for they who seem to be somewhat in conference add nothing to me but contrariwise when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision be commit unto me a the gospel of the circumcision be unto peter for he that wrought effectually in peter to the apostleship of the circumcision the same be mighty in me toward the gentile and when james cephas and john who seem to be pillar perceive the grace that be give unto me they give to me and barnabas the right hand of fellowship that we should go unto the heathen and they unto the circumcision only they would that we should remember the poor the same which also be forward to do but when peter be come to antioch withstood him to the face because he be to be blame for before that certain come from james he do eat with the gentile but when they be come he withdrew and separate himself fear them which be of the circumcision and the other jew dissemble likewise with him insomuch that barnabas also be carry away with their dissimulation but when saw that they walk not uprightly accord to the truth of the gospel say unto peter before them all if thou be jew liv after the manner of gentile and not a do the jew why compellest thou the gentile to live a do the jew we who be jew by nature and not sinner of the gentile know that man be not justified by the work of the law but by the faith of jesus christ even we have believe in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ and not by the work of the law for by the work of the law shall no flesh be justified but if while we seek to be justified by christ we ourselves also be found sinner be therefore christ the minister of sin god forbid for if build again the thing which destroyed make myself transgressor for through the law be dead to the law that might live unto god be crucify with christ neverthless live yet not but christ liveth in me and the life which now live in the flesh live by the faith of the son of god who love me and give himself for me do not frustrate the grace of god for if righteousness come by the law then christ be dead in vain foolish galatian who hath bewitch you that ye should not obey the truth before whose eye jesus christ hath be evidently set forth crucify among you this only would learn of you receive ye the spirit by the work of the law or by the hearing of faith be ye so foolish have begin in the spirit be ye now make perfect by the flesh have ye suffer so many thing in vain if it be yet in vain he therefore that ministereth to you the spirit and worketh miracle among you doeth he it by the work of the law or by the hearing of faith even a abraham believe god and it be account to him for righteousness know ye therefore that they which be of faith the same be the child of abraham and the scripture foresee that god would justify the heathen through faith preach before the gospel unto abraham say in thee shall all nation be bless so then they which be of faith be bless with faithful abraham for a many a be of the work of the law be under the curse for it be write curse be every one that continueth not in all thing which be write in the book of the law to do them but that no man be justified by the law in the sight of god it be evident for the just shall live by faith and the law be not of faith but the man that doeth them shall live in them christ hath redeem u from the curse of the law be make curse for u for it be write curse be every one that hangeth on tree that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentile through jesus christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith brother speak after the manner of men though it be but man covenant yet if it be confirm no man disannulleth or addeth thereto now to abraham and his seed be the promise make he saith not and to seed a of many but a of one and to thy seed which be christ and this say that the covenant that be confirm before of god in christ the law which be four hundred and thirty year after cannot disannul that it should make the promise of none effect for if the inheritance be of the law it be no more of promise but god give it to abraham by promise wherefore then serveth the law it be add because of transgression till the seed should come to whom the promise be make and it be ordain by angel in the hand of mediator now mediator be not mediator of one but god be one be the law then against the promise of god god forbid for if there have be law give which could have give life verily righteousness should have be by the law but the scripture hath conclude all under sin that the promise by faith of jesus christ might be give to them that believe but before faith come we be kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be reveal wherefore the law be our schoolmaster to bring u unto christ that we might be justified by faith but after that faith be come we be no longer under schoolmaster for ye be all the child of god by faith in christ jesus for a many of you a have be baptize into christ have put on christ there be neither jew nor greek there be neither bond nor free there be neither male nor female for ye be all one in christ jesus and if ye be christ then be ye abraham seed and heir accord to the promise now say that the heir a long a he be child differeth nothing from servant though he be lord of all but be under tutor and governor until the time appoint of the father even so we when we be child be in bondage under the element of the world but when the fulness of the time be come god sent forth his son make of woman make under the law to redeem them that be under the law that we might receive the adoption of son and because ye be son god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your heart cry abba father wherefore thou art no more servant but son and if son then an heir of god through christ howbeit then when ye knew not god ye do service unto them which by nature be no god but now after that ye have know god or rather be know of god how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly element whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage ye observe day and month and time and year be afraid of you l have bestow upon you labour in vain brother beseech you be a be for be a ye be ye have not injured me at all ye know how through infirmity of the flesh preach the gospel unto you at the first and my temptation which be in my flesh ye despise not nor reject but receive me a an angel of god even a christ jesus where be then the blessedness ye spake of for bear you record that if it have be possible ye would have plucked out your own eye and have give them to me be therefore become your enemy because tell you the truth they zealously affect you but not well yea they would exclude you that ye might affect them but it be good to be zealously affected always in good thing and not only when be present with you my little child of whom travail in birth again until christ be form in you desire to be present with you now and to change my voice for stand in doubt of you tell me ye that desire to be under the law do ye not hear the law for it be write that abraham have two son the one by bondmaid the other by freewoman but he who be of the bondwoman be born after the flesh but he of the freewoman be by promise which thing be an allegory for these be the two covenant the one from the mount sinai which gendereth to bondage which be agar for this agar be mount sinai in arabia and answereth to jerusalem which now be and be in bondage with her child but jerusalem which be above be free which be the mother of u all for it be write rejoice thou barren that bearest not break forth and cry thou that travailest not for the desolate hath many more child than she which hath an husband now we brother a isaac be be the child of promise but a then he that be born after the flesh persecute him that be born after the spirit even so it be now nevertheless what saith the scripture cast out the bondwoman and her son for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman so then brother we be not child of the bondwoman but of the free stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ hath make u free and be not entangle again with the yoke of bondage behold paul say unto you that if ye be circumcise christ shall profit you nothing for testify again to every man that be circumcise that he be debtor to do the whole law christ be become of no effect unto you whosoever of you be justified by the law ye be fall from grace for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith for in jesus christ neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love ye do run well who do hinder you that ye should not obey the truth this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you little leaven leaveneth the whole lump have confidence in you through the lord that ye will be none otherwise mind but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment whosoever he be and brother if yet preach circumcision why do yet suffer persecution then be the offence of the cross cease would they be even cut off which trouble you for brother ye have be call unto liberty only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another for all the law be fulfil in one word even in this thou shalt love thy neighbour a thyself but if ye bite and devour one another take heed that ye be not consume one of another this say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these be contrary the one to the other so that ye cannot do the thing that ye would but if ye be lead of the spirit ye be not under the law now the work of the flesh be manifest which be these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulation wrath strife sedition heresy envyings murder drunkenness revellings and such like of the which tell you before a have also told you in time past that they which do such thing shall not inherit the kingdom of god but the fruit of the spirit be love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there be no law and they that be christ have crucify the flesh with the affection and lust if we live in the spirit let u also walk in the spirit let u not be desirous of vain glory provoke one another envy one another brother if man be overtaken in fault ye which be spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness consider thyself l thou also be tempt bear ye one another burden and so fulfil the law of christ for if man think himself to be something when he be nothing he deceiveth himself but let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoice in himself alone and not in another for every man shall bear his own burden let him that be taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good thing be not deceive god be not mocked for whatsoever man soweth that shall he also reap for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting and let u not be weary in well do for in due season we shall reap if we faint not a we have therefore opportunity let u do good unto all men especially unto them who be of the household of faith ye see how large letter have write unto you with mine own hand a many a desire to make fair shew in the flesh they constrain you to be circumcise only l they should suffer persecution for the cross of christ for neither they themselves who be circumcise keep the law but desire to have you circumcise that they may glory in your flesh but god forbid that should glory save in the cross of our lord jesus christ by whom the world be crucify unto me and unto the world for in christ jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision but new creature and a many a walk accord to this rule peace be on them and mercy and upon the israel of god from henceforth let no man trouble me for bear in my body the mark of the lord jesus brother the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit amen book ephesian paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saint which be at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ bless be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath bless u with all spiritual blessing in heavenly place in christ accord a he hath chosen u in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love have predestinate u unto the adoption of child by jesus christ to himself accord to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath make u accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sin accord to the rich of his grace wherein he hath abound toward u in all wisdom and prudence have make know unto u the mystery of his will accord to his good pleasure which he hath purpose in himself that in the dispensation of the fulness of time he might gather together in one all thing in christ both which be in heaven and which be on earth even in him in whom also we have obtain an inheritance be predestinate accord to the purpose of him who worketh all thing after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trust in christ in whom ye also trust after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believe ye be seal with that holy spirit of promise which be the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchase possession unto the praise of his glory wherefore also after heard of your faith in the lord jesus and love unto all the saint cease not to give thanks for you make mention of you in my prayer that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him the eye of your understand be enlighten that ye may know what be the hope of his call and what the rich of the glory of his inheritance in the saint and what be the exceed greatness of his power to u ward who believe accord to the work of his mighty power which he wrought in christ when he raise him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly place far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that be name not only in this world but also in that which be to come and hath put all thing under his foot and give him to be the head over all thing to the church which be his body the fulness of him that filleth all in all and you hath he quicken who be dead in trespass and sin wherein in time past ye walk accord to the course of this world accord to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the child of disobedience among whom also we all have our conversation in time past in the lust of our flesh fulfil the desire of the flesh and of the mind and be by nature the child of wrath even a others but god who be rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he love u even when we be dead in sin hath quicken u together with christ by grace ye be save and hath raise u up together and make u sit together in heavenly place in christ jesus that in the age to come he might shew the exceed rich of his grace in his kindness toward u through christ jesus for by grace be ye save through faith and that not of yourselves it be the gift of god not of work l any man should boast for we be his workmanship create in christ jesus unto good work which god hath before ordain that we should walk in them wherefore remember that ye be in time past gentile in the flesh who be call uncircumcision by that which be call the circumcision in the flesh make by hand that at that time ye be without christ be alien from the commonwealth of israel and stranger from the covenant of promise have no hope and without god in the world but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes be far off be make nigh by the blood of christ for he be our peace who hath make both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between u have abolish in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandment contain in ordinance for to make in himself of twain one new man so make peace and that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross have slain the enmity thereby and come and preach peace to you which be afar off and to them that be nigh for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father now therefore ye be no more stranger and foreigner but fellowcitizens with the saint and of the household of god and be built upon the foundation of the apostle and prophet jesus christ himself be the chief corner stone in whom all the building fitly frame together groweth unto an holy temple in the lord in whom ye also be build together for an habitation of god through the spirit for this cause paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentile if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which be give me to you ward how that by revelation he make know unto me the mystery a write afore in few word whereby when ye read ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ which in other age be not make know unto the son of men a it be now reveal unto his holy apostle and prophet by the spirit that the gentile should be fellowheirs and of the same body and partaker of his promise in christ by the gospel whereof be make minister accord to the gift of the grace of god give unto me by the effectual work of his power unto me who be less than the least of all saint be this grace give that should preach among the gentile the unsearchable rich of christ and to make all men see what be the fellowship of the mystery which from the begin of the world hath be hid in god who create all thing by jesus christ to the intent that now unto the principality and power in heavenly place might be know by the church the manifold wisdom of god accord to the eternal purpose which he purpose in christ jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him wherefore desire that ye faint not at my tribulation for you which be your glory for this cause bow my knee unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth be name that he would grant you accord to the rich of his glory to be strengthen with might by his spirit in the inner man that christ may dwell in your heart by faith that ye be root and ground in love may be able to comprehend with all saint what be the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be fill with all the fulness of god now unto him that be able to do exceed abundantly above all that we ask or think accord to the power that worketh in u unto him be glory in the church by christ jesus throughout all age world without end amen therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye be call with all lowliness and meekness with longsuffering forbear one another in love endeavour to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace there be one body and one spirit even a ye be call in one hope of your call one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who be above all and through all and in you all but unto every one of u be give grace accord to the measure of the gift of christ wherefore he saith when he ascend up on high he lead captivity captive and give gift unto men now that he ascend what be it but that he also descend first into the low part of the earth he that descend be the same also that ascend up far above all heaven that he might fill all thing and he give some apostle and some prophet and some evangelist and some pastor and teacher for the perfect of the saint for the work of the ministry for the edify of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of christ that we henceforth be no more child toss to and fro and carry about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speak the truth in love may grow up into him in all thing which be the head even christ from whom the whole body fitly join together and compact by that which every joint supplieth accord to the effectual work in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edify of itself in love this say therefore and testify in the lord that ye henceforth walk not a other gentile walk in the vanity of their mind have the understand darken be alienate from the life of god through the ignorance that be in them because of the blindness of their heart who be past feel have give themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness but ye have not so learn christ if so be that ye have heard him and have be taught by him a the truth be in jesus that ye put off concern the former conversation the old man which be corrupt accord to the deceitful lust and be renew in the spirit of your mind and that ye put on the new man which after god be create in righteousness and true holiness wherefore put away lie speak every man truth with his neighbour for we be member one of another be ye angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labour work with his hand the thing which be good that he may have to give to him that needeth let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which be good to the use of edify that it may minister grace unto the hearer and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye be seal unto the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour and evil speak be put away from you with all malice and be ye kind one to another tenderhearted forgive one another even a god for christ sake hath forgiven you be ye therefore follower of god a dear child and walk in love a christ also hath love u and hath give himself for u an offering and sacrifice to god for sweetsmelling savour but fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness let it not be once name among you a becometh saint neither filthiness nor foolish talk nor jesting which be not convenient but rather give of thanks for this ye know that no whoremonger nor unclean person nor covetous man who be an idolater hath any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god let no man deceive you with vain word for because of these thing cometh the wrath of god upon the child of disobedience be not ye therefore partaker with them for ye be sometimes darkness but now be ye light in the lord walk a child of light for the fruit of the spirit be in all goodness and righteousness and truth prove what be acceptable unto the lord and have no fellowship with the unfruitful work of darkness but rather reprove them for it be shame even to speak of those thing which be do of them in secret but all thing that be reprove be make manifest by the light for whatsoever doth make manifest be light wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee light see then that ye walk circumspectly not a fool but a wise redeem the time because the day be evil wherefore be ye not unwise but understand what the will of the lord be and be not drunk with wine wherein be excess but be fill with the spirit speak to yourselves in psalm and hymn and spiritual song sing and make melody in your heart to the lord give thanks always for all thing unto god and the father in the name of our lord jesus christ submit yourselves one to another in the fear of god wife submit yourselves unto your own husband a unto the lord for the husband be the head of the wife even a christ be the head of the church and he be the saviour of the body therefore a the church be subject unto christ so let the wife be to their own husband in every thing husband love your wife even a christ also love the church and give himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the wash of water by the word that he might present it to himself glorious church not have spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wife a their own body he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hat his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even a the lord the church for we be member of his body of his flesh and of his bone for this cause shall man leave his father and mother and shall be join unto his wife and they two shall be one flesh this be great mystery but speak concern christ and the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even a himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband child obey your parent in the lord for this be right honour thy father and mother which be the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth and ye father provoke not your child to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord servant be obedient to them that be your master accord to the flesh with fear and tremble in singleness of your heart a unto christ not with eyeservice a menpleasers but a the servant of christ do the will of god from the heart with good will do service a to the lord and not to men know that whatsoever good thing any man doeth the same shall he receive of the lord whether he be bond or free and ye master do the same thing unto them forbear threaten know that your master also be in heaven neither be there respect of person with him finally my brother be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armour of god that ye may be able to stand against the wile of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principality against power against the ruler of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high place wherefore take unto you the whole armour of god that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and have do all to stand stand therefore have your loin girt about with truth and have on the breastplate of righteousness and your foot shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all take the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery dart of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which be the word of god pray always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watch thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saint and for me that utterance may be give unto me that may open my mouth boldly to make know the mystery of the gospel for which be an ambassador in bond that therein may speak boldly a ought to speak but that ye also may know my affair and how do tychicus beloved brother and faithful minister in the lord shall make know to you all thing whom have sent unto you for the same purpose that ye might know our affair and that he might comfort your heart peace be to the brother and love with faith from god the father and the lord jesus christ grace be with all them that love our lord jesus christ in sincerity amen book philippian paul and timotheus the servant of jesus christ to all the saint in christ jesus which be at philippi with the bishop and deacon grace be unto you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ thank my god upon every remembrance of you always in every prayer of mine for you all make request with joy for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now be confident of this very thing that he which hath begin good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ even a it be meet for me to think this of you all because have you in my heart inasmuch a both in my bond and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel ye all be partaker of my grace for god be my record how greatly long after you all in the bowel of jesus christ and this pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment that ye may approve thing that be excellent that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of christ be fill with the fruit of righteousness which be by jesus christ unto the glory and praise of god but would ye should understand brother that the thing which happen unto me have fall out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel so that my bond in christ be manifest in all the palace and in all other place and many of the brother in the lord wax confident by my bond be much more bold to speak the word without fear some indeed preach christ even of envy and strife and some also of good will the one preach christ of contention not sincerely suppose to add affliction to my bond but the other of love know that be set for the defence of the gospel what then notwithstanding every way whether in pretence or in truth christ be preach and therein do rejoice yea and will rejoice for know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer and the supply of the spirit of jesus christ accord to my earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing shall be ashamed but that with all boldness a always so now also christ shall be magnify in my body whether it be by life or by death for to me to live be christ and to die be gain but if live in the flesh this be the fruit of my labour yet what shall choose wot not for be in strait betwixt two have desire to depart and to be with christ which be far well nevertheless to abide in the flesh be more needful for you and have this confidence know that shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith that your rejoice may be more abundant in jesus christ for me by my come to you again only let your conversation be a it becometh the gospel of christ that whether come and see you or else be absent may hear of your affair that ye stand fast in one spirit with one mind strive together for the faith of the gospel and in nothing terrify by your adversary which be to them an evident token of perdition but to you of salvation and that of god for unto you it be give in the behalf of christ not only to believe on him but also to suffer for his sake have the same conflict which ye saw in me and now hear to be in me if there be therefore any consolation in christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any bowel and mercy fulfil ye my joy that ye be likeminded have the same love be of one accord of one mind let nothing be do through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other well than themselves look not every man on his own thing but every man also on the thing of others let this mind be in you which be also in christ jesus who be in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but make himself of no reputation and take upon him the form of servant and be make in the likeness of men and be found in fashion a man he humble himself and become obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore god also hath highly exalt him and give him name which be above every name that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of thing in heaven and thing in earth and thing under the earth and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ be lord to the glory of god the father wherefore my beloved a ye have always obeyed not a in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and tremble for it be god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure do all thing without murmuring and disputings that ye may be blameless and harmless the son of god without rebuke in the midst of crooked and perverse nation among whom ye shine a light in the world hold forth the word of life that may rejoice in the day of christ that have not run in vain neither labour in vain yea and if be offer upon the sacrifice and service of your faith joy and rejoice with you all for the same cause also do ye joy and rejoice with me but trust in the lord jesus to send timotheus shortly unto you that also may be of good comfort when know your state for have no man likeminded who will naturally care for your state for all seek their own not the thing which be jesus christ but ye know the proof of him that a son with the father he hath serve with me in the gospel him therefore hope to send presently so soon a shall see how it will go with me but trust in the lord that also myself shall come shortly yet suppose it necessary to send to you epaphroditus my brother and companion in labour and fellowsoldier but your messenger and he that minister to my want for he long after you all and be full of heaviness because that ye have heard that he have be sick for indeed he be sick nigh unto death but god have mercy on him and not on him only but on me also l should have sorrow upon sorrow sent him therefore the more carefully that when ye see him again ye may rejoice and that may be the less sorrowful receive him therefore in the lord with all gladness and hold such in reputation

be ignorant brother concern them which be asleep that ye sorrow not even a others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus die and rise again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which be alive and remain unto the come of the lord shall not prevent them which be asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which be alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the cloud to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these word but of the time and the season brother ye have no need that write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them a travail upon woman with child and they shall not escape but ye brother be not in darkness that that day should overtake you a thief ye be all the child of light and the child of the day we be not of the night nor of darkness therefore let u not sleep a do others but let u watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken be drunken in the night but let u who be of the day be sober put on the breastplate of faith and love and for an helmet the hope of salvation for god hath not appoint u to wrath but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ who die for u that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him wherefore comfort yourselves together and edify one another even a also ye do and we beseech you brother to know them which labour among you and be over you in the lord and admonish you and to esteem them very highly in love for their work sake and be at peace among yourselves now we exhort you brother warn them that be unruly comfort the feebleminded support

unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be save and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion that they should believe lie that they all might be damn who believe not the truth but have pleasure in unrighteousness but we be bound to give thanks alway to god for you brother beloved of the lord because god hath from the begin chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth whereunto he call you by our gospel to the obtain of the glory of our lord jesus christ therefore brother stand fast and hold the tradition which ye have be taught whether by word or our epistle now our lord jesus christ himself and god even our father which hath love u and hath give u everlasting consolation and good hope through grace comfort your heart and stablish you in every good word and work finally brother pray for u that the word of the lord may have free course and be glorify even a it be with you and

that ye both do and will do the thing which we command you and the lord direct your heart into the love of god and into the patient wait for christ now we command you brother in the name of our lord jesus christ that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly and not after the tradition which he receive of u for yourselves know how ye ought to follow u for we behave not ourselves disorderly among you neither do we eat any man bread for nought but wrought with labour and travail night and day that we might not be chargeable to any of you not because we have not power but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow u for even when we be with you this we command you that if any would not work neither should he eat for we hear that there be some which walk among you disorderly work not at all but be busybody now them that be such we command and exhort by our lord jesus christ that with quietness they work and eat their own bread but ye brother be not weary in well do and if any man obey not our word by this epistle note that man and have no company with him that he may be ashamed yet count him not a an enemy but admonish him a brother now the lord of peace himself give you peace always by all mean the lord be with you all the salutation of paul with mine own hand which be the token in every epistle so write the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen book timothy paul an apostle of jesus christ by the commandment of god our saviour and lord jesus christ which be our hope unto timothy my own son in the faith grace mercy and peace from god our father and jesus christ our lord a besought thee to abide still at ephesus when go into macedonia that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine neither give heed to fable and endless genealogy which minister question rather than godly edify which be in faith so do now the end of the commandment be charity out of pure heart and of good conscience and of faith unfeigned from which some have swerve have turn aside unto vain jangling desire to be teacher of the law understand neither what they say nor whereof they affirm but we know that the law be good if man use it lawfully know this that the law be not make for righteous man but for the lawless and disobedient for the ungodly and for sinner for unholy and profane for murderer of father and murderer of mother for manslayer for whoremonger for them that defile themselves with mankind for menstealers for liar for perjure person and if there be any other thing that be contrary to sound doctrine accord to the glorious gospel of the bless god which be commit to my trust and thank christ jesus our lord who hath enable me for that he count me faithful put me into the ministry who be before blasphemer and persecutor and injurious but obtain mercy because do it ignorantly in unbelief and the grace of our lord be exceed abundant with faith and love which be in christ jesus this be faithful say and worthy of all acceptation that christ jesus come into the world to save sinner of whom be chief howbeit for this cause obtain mercy that in me first jesus christ might shew forth all longsuffering for pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting now unto the king eternal immortal invisible the only wise god be honour and glory for ever and ever amen this charge commit unto thee son timothy accord to the prophecy which go before on thee that thou by them mightest war good warfare hold faith and good conscience which some have put away concern faith have make shipwreck of whom be hymenaeus and alexander whom have deliver unto satan that they may learn not to blaspheme exhort therefore that first of all supplication prayer intercession and give of thanks be make for all men for king and for all that be in authority that we may lead quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty for this be good and acceptable in the sight of god our saviour who will have all men to be save and to come unto the knowledge of the truth for there be one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus who give himself ransom for all to be testify in due time whereunto be ordain preacher and an apostle speak the truth in christ and lie not teacher of the gentile in faith and verity will therefore that men pray every where lift up holy hand without wrath and doubt in like manner also that woman adorn themselves in modest apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety not with broided hair or gold or pearl or costly array but which becometh woman profess godliness with good work let the woman learn in silence with all subjection but suffer not woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence for adam be first form then eve and adam be not deceive but the woman be deceive be in the transgression notwithstanding she shall be save in childbearing if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety this be true say if man desire the office of bishop he desireth good work bishop then must be blameless the husband of one wife vigilant sober of good behaviour give to hospitality apt to teach not give to wine no striker not greedy of filthy lucre but patient not brawler not covetous one that ruleth well his own house have his child in subjection with all gravity for if man know not how to rule his own house how shall he take care of the church of god not novice l be lift up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil moreover he must have good report of them which be without l he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil likewise must the deacon be grave not doubletongued not give to much wine not greedy of filthy lucre hold the mystery of the faith in pure conscience and let these also first be prove then let them use the office of deacon be found blameless even so must their wife be grave not slanderer sober faithful in all thing let the deacon be the husband of one wife ruling their child and their own house well for they that have use the office of deacon well purchase to themselves good degree and great boldness in the faith which be in christ jesus these thing write unto thee hop to come unto thee shortly but if tarry long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of god which be the church of the living god the pillar and ground of the truth and without controversy great be the mystery of godliness god be manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit see of angel preach unto the gentile believe on in the world receive up into glory now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter time some shall depart from the faith give heed to seduce spirit and doctrine of devil speak lie in hypocrisy have their conscience sear with hot iron forbid to marry and command to abstain from meat which god hath create to be receive with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth for every creature of god be good and nothing to be refuse if it be receive with thanksgiving for it be sanctify by the word of god and prayer if thou put the brother in remembrance of these thing thou shalt be good minister of jesus christ nourish up in the word of faith and of good doctrine whereunto thou hast attain but refuse profane and old wife fable and exercise thyself rather unto godliness for bodily exercise profiteth little but godliness be profitable unto all thing have promise of the life that now be and of that which be to come this be faithful say and worthy of all acceptation for therefore we both labour and suffer reproach because we trust in the living god who be the saviour of all men specially of those that believe these thing command and teach let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the believer in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity till come give attendance to reading to exhortation to doctrine neglect not the gift that be in thee which be give thee by prophecy with the lay on of the hand of the presbytery meditate upon these thing give thyself wholly to them that thy profit may appear to all take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine continue in them for in do this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee rebuke not an elder but intreat him a father and the young men a brother the elder woman a mother the young a sister with all purity honour widow that be widow indeed but if any widow have child or nephew let them learn first to shew piety at home and to requite their parent for that be good and acceptable before god now she that be widow indeed and desolate trusteth in god and continueth in supplication and prayer night and day but she that liveth in pleasure be dead while she liveth and these thing give in charge that they may be blameless but if any provide not for his own and specially for those of his own house he hath deny the faith and be bad than an infidel let not widow be take into the number under threescore year old have be the wife of one man well report of for good work if she have brought up child if she have lodge stranger if she have wash the saint foot if she have relieve the afflict if she have diligently follow every good work but the young widow refuse for when they have begin to wax wanton against christ they will marry have damnation because they have cast off their first faith and withal they learn to be idle wander about from house to house and not only idle but tattler also and busybody speak thing which they ought not will therefore that the young woman marry bear child guide the house give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully for some be already turn aside after satan if any man or woman that believeth have widow let them relieve them and let not the church be charge that it may relieve them that be widow indeed let the elder that rule well be count worthy of double honour especially they who labour in the word and doctrine for the scripture saith thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn and the labourer be worthy of his reward against an elder receive not an accusation but before two or three witness them that sin rebuke

wherefore though might be much bold in christ to enjoin thee that which be convenient yet for love sake rather beseech thee be such an one a paul the age and now also prisoner of jesus christ beseech thee for my son onesimus whom have begotten in my bond which in time past be to thee unprofitable but now profitable to thee and to me whom have sent again thou therefore receive him that be mine own bowel whom would have retain with me that in thy stead he might have minister unto me in the bond of the gospel but without thy mind would do nothing that thy benefit should not be a it be of necessity but willingly for perhaps he therefore depart for season that thou shouldest receive him for ever not now a servant but above servant brother beloved specially to me but how much more unto thee both in the flesh and in the lord if thou count me therefore partner receive him a myself if he hath wrong thee or oweth thee ought put that on mine account paul have write it with mine own hand will repay it albeit do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides yea brother let me have joy of thee in the lord refresh my bowel in the lord have confidence in thy obedience write unto thee know that thou wilt also do more than say but withal prepare me also lodge for trust that through your prayer shall be give unto you there salute thee epaphras my fellowprisoner in christ jesus marcus aristarchus demas lucas my fellowlabourers the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit amen book hebrew god who at sundry time and in diver manner spake in time past unto the father by the prophet hath in these last day spoken unto u by his son whom he hath appoint heir of all thing by whom also he make the world who be the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and uphold all thing by the word of his power when he have by himself purge our sin sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high be make so much well than the angel a he hath by inheritance obtain more excellent name than they for unto which of the angel say he at any time thou art my son this day have begotten thee and again will be to him father and he shall be to me son and again when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world he saith and let all the angel of god worship him and of the angel he saith who maketh his angel spirit and his minister flame of fire but unto the son he saith thy throne god be for ever and ever sceptre of righteousness be the sceptre of thy kingdom thou hast love righteousness and hat iniquity therefore god even thy god hath anoint thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellow and thou lord in the begin hast laid the foundation of the earth and the heaven be the work of thine hand they shall perish but thou remainest and they all shall wax old a doth garment and a vesture shalt thou fold them up and they shall be change but thou art the same and thy year shall not fail but to which of the angel say he at any time sit on my right hand until make thine enemy thy footstool be they not all minister spirit sent forth to minister for them who shall be heir of salvation therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the thing which we have heard l at any time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by angel be stedfast and every transgression and disobedience receive just recompence of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first begin to be spoken by the lord and be confirm unto u by them that heard him god also bearing them witness both with sign and wonder and with diver miracle and gift of the holy ghost accord to his own will for unto the angel hath he not put in subjection the world to come whereof we speak but one in certain place testify say what be man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou visitest him thou mad him little low than the angel thou crownedst him with glory and honour and didst set him over the work of thy hand thou hast put all thing in subjection under his foot for in that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that be not put under him but now we see not yet all thing put under him but we see jesus who be make little low than the angel for the suffer of death crown with glory and honour that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man for it become him for whom be all thing and by whom be all thing in bring many son unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering for both he that sanctifieth and they who be sanctify be all of one for which cause he be not ashamed to call them brother say will declare thy name unto my brother in the midst of the church will sing praise unto thee and again will put my trust in him and again behold and the child which god hath give me forasmuch then a the child be partaker of flesh and blood he also himself likewise take part of the same that through death he might destroy him that have the power of death that be the devil and deliver them who through fear of death be all their lifetime subject to bondage for verily he take not on him the nature of angel but he take on him the seed of abraham wherefore in all thing it behove him to be make like unto his brother that he might be merciful and faithful high priest in thing pertain to god to make reconciliation for the sin of the people for in that he himself hath suffer be tempt he be able to succour them that be tempt wherefore holy brother partaker of the heavenly call consider the apostle and high priest of our profession christ jesus who be faithful to him that appoint him a also moses be faithful in all his house for this man be count worthy of more glory than moses inasmuch a he who hath build the house hath more honour than the house for every house be build by some man but he that built all thing be god and moses verily be faithful in all his house a servant for testimony of those thing which be to be spoken after but christ a son over his own house whose house be we if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoice of the hope firm unto the end wherefore a the holy ghost saith to day if ye will hear his voice harden not your heart a in the provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness when your father tempt me prove me and saw my work forty year wherefore be grieve with that generation and say they do alway err in their heart and they have not know my way so sware in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest take heed brother l there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in depart from the living god but exhort one another daily while it be call to day l any of you be harden through the deceitfulness of sin for we be make partaker of christ if we hold the begin of our confidence stedfast unto the end while it be say to day if ye will hear his voice harden not your heart a in the provocation for some when they have heard do provoke howbeit not all that come out of egypt by moses but with whom be he grieve forty year be it not with them that have sin whose carcase fell in the wilderness and to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believe not so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief let u therefore fear l promise be left u of enter into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto u be the gospel preach a well a unto them but the word preach do not profit them not be mixed with faith in them that heard it for we which have believe do enter into rest a he say a have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the work be finish from the foundation of the world for he spake in certain place of the seventh day on this wise and god do rest the seventh day from all his work and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest see therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it be first preach enter not in because of unbelief again he limiteth certain day say in david to day after so long time a it be say to day if ye will hear his voice harden not your heart for if jesus have give them rest then would he not afterward have spoken of another day there remaineth therefore rest to the people of god for he that be enter into his rest he also hath cease from his own work a god do from his let u labour therefore to enter into that rest l any man fall after the same example of unbelief for the word of god be quick and powerful and sharper than any twoedged sword pierce even to the divide asunder of soul and spirit and of the joint and marrow and be discerner of the thought and intent of the heart neither be there any creature that be not manifest in his sight but all thing be naked and open unto the eye of him with whom we have to do see then that we have great high priest that be pass into the heaven jesus the son of god let u hold fast our profession for we have not an high priest which cannot be touch with the feel of our infirmity but be in all point tempt like a we be yet without sin let u therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need for every high priest take from among men be ordain for men in thing pertain to god that he may offer both gift and sacrifice for sin who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that be out of the way for that he himself also be compass with infirmity and by reason hereof he ought a for the people so also for himself to offer for sin and no man taketh this honour unto himself but he that be call of god a be aaron so also christ glorify not himself to be make an high priest but he that say unto him thou art my son to day have begotten thee a he saith also in another place thou art priest for ever after the order of melchisedec who in the day of his flesh when he have offer up prayer and supplication with strong cry and tear unto him that be able to save him from death and be heard in that he fear though he be son yet learn he obedience by the thing which he suffer and be make perfect he become the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him call of god an high priest after the order of melchisedec of whom we have many thing to say and hard to be uttered see ye be dull of hearing for when for the time ye ought to be teacher ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principle of the oracle of god and be become such a have need of milk and not of strong meat for every one that useth milk be unskilful in the word of righteousness for he be babe but strong meat belongeth to them that be of full age even those who by reason of use have their sens exercise to discern both good and evil therefore leave the principle of the doctrine of christ let u go on unto perfection not lay again the foundation of repentance from dead work and of faith toward god of the doctrine of baptism and of lay on of hand and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment and this will we do if god permit for it be impossible for those who be once enlighten and have taste of the heavenly gift and be make partaker of the holy ghost and have taste the good word of god and the power of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance see they crucify to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it and bringeth forth herb meet for them by whom it be dress receiveth blessing from god but that which beareth thorn and brier be reject and be nigh unto curse whose end be to be burn but beloved we be persuade well thing of you and thing that accompany salvation though we thus speak for god be not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love which ye have shew toward his name in that ye have minister to the saint and do minister and we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end that ye be not slothful but follower of them who through faith and patience inherit the promise for when god make promise to abraham because he could swear by no great he sware by himself say surely blessing will bless thee and multiply will multiply thee and so after he have patiently endure he obtain the promise for men verily swear by the great and an oath for confirmation be to them an end of all strife wherein god willing more abundantly to shew unto the heir of promise the immutability of his counsel confirm it by an oath that by two immutable thing in which it be impossible for god to lie we might have strong consolation who have flee for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before u which hope we have a an anchor of the soul both sure and stedfast and which entereth into that within the veil whither the forerunner be for u enter even jesus make an high priest for ever after the order of melchisedec for this melchisedec king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham return from the slaughter of the king and bless him to whom also abraham give tenth part of all first be by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which be king of peace without father without mother without descent have neither begin of day nor end of life but make like unto the son of god abideth priest continually now consider how great this man be unto whom even the patriarch abraham give the tenth of the spoil and verily they that be of the son of levi who receive the office of the priesthood have commandment to take tithe of the people accord to the law that be of their brother though they come out of the loin of abraham but he whose descent be not count from them receive tithe of abraham and bless him that have the promise and without all contradiction the less be bless of the well and here men that die receive tithe but there he receiveth them of whom it be witness that he liveth and a may so say levi also who receiveth tithe payed tithe in abraham for he be yet in the loin of his father when melchisedec met him if therefore perfection be by the levitical priesthood for under it the people receive the law what far need be there that another priest should rise after the order of melchisedec and not be call after the order of aaron for the priesthood be change there be make of necessity change also of the law for he of whom these thing be spoken pertaineth to another tribe of which no man give attendance at the altar for it be evident that our lord sprang out of juda of which tribe moses spake nothing concern priesthood and it be yet far more evident for that after the similitude of melchisedec there ariseth another priest who be make not after the law of carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life for he testifieth thou art priest for ever after the order of melchisedec for there be verily disannulling of the commandment go before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof for the law make nothing perfect but the bring in of well hope do by the which we draw nigh unto god and inasmuch a not without an oath he be make priest for those priest be make without an oath but this with an oath by him that say unto him the lord sware and will not repent thou art priest for ever after the order of melchisedec by so much be jesus make surety of well testament and they truly be many priest because they be not suffer to continue by reason of death but this man because he continueth ever hath an unchangeable priesthood wherefore he be able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto god by him see he ever liveth to make intercession for them for such an high priest become u who be holy harmless undefiled separate from sinner and make high than the heaven who needeth not daily a those high priest to offer up sacrifice first for his own sin and then for the people for this he do once when he offer up himself for the law maketh men high priest which have infirmity but the word of the oath which be since the law maketh the son who be consecrate for evermore now of the thing which we have spoken this be the sum we have such an high priest who be set on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heaven minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the lord pitch and not man for every high priest be ordain to offer gift and sacrifice wherefore it be of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer for if he be on earth he should not be priest see that there be priest that offer gift accord to the law who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly thing a moses be admonish of god when he be about to make the tabernacle for see saith he that thou make all thing accord to the pattern shew to thee in the mount but now hath he obtain more excellent ministry by how much also he be the mediator of well covenant which be establish upon well promise for if that first covenant have be faultless then should no place have be sought for the second for find fault with them he saith behold the day come saith the lord when will make new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah not accord to the covenant that make with their father in the day when take them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt because they continued not in my covenant and regard them not saith the lord for this be the covenant that will make with the house of israel after those day saith the lord will put my law into their mind and write them in their heart and will be to them god and they shall be to me people and they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother say know the lord for all shall know me from the least to the great for will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sin and their iniquity will remember no more in that he saith new covenant he hath make the first old now that which decayeth and waxeth old be ready to vanish away then verily the first covenant have also ordinance of divine service and worldly sanctuary for there be tabernacle make the first wherein be the candlestick and the table and the shewbread which be call the sanctuary and after the second veil the tabernacle which be call the holiest of all which have the golden censer and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold wherein be the golden pot that have manna and aaron rod that bud and the table of the covenant and over it the cherubims of glory shadow the mercyseat of which we cannot now speak particularly now when these thing be thus ordain the priest go always into the first tabernacle accomplish the service of god but into the second go the high priest alone once every year not without blood which he offer for himself and for the error of the people the holy ghost this signify that the way into the holiest of all be not yet make manifest while a the first tabernacle be yet stand which be figure for the time then present in which be offer both gift and sacrifice that could not make him that do the service perfect a pertain to the conscience which stood only in meat and drink and diver washing and carnal ordinance impose on them until the time of reformation but christ be come an high priest of good thing to come by great and more perfect tabernacle not make with hand that be to say not of this building neither by the blood of goat and calf but by his own blood he enter in once into the holy place have obtain eternal redemption for u for if the blood of bull and of goat and the ash of an heifer sprinkle the unclean sanctifieth to the purify of the flesh how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offer himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead work to serve the living god and for this cause he be the mediator of the new testament that by mean of death for the redemption of the transgression that be under the first testament they which be call might receive the promise of eternal inheritance for where testament be there must also of necessity be the death of the testator for testament be of force after men be dead otherwise it be of no strength at all while the testator liveth whereupon neither the first testament be dedicate without blood for when moses have spoken every precept to all the people accord to the law he take the blood of calf and of goat with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkle both the book and all the people say this be the blood of the testament which god hath enjoin unto you moreover he sprinkle with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessel of the ministry and almost all thing be by the law purge with blood and without shed of blood be no remission it be therefore necessary that the pattern of thing in the heaven should be purify with these but the heavenly thing themselves with well sacrifice than these for christ be not enter into the holy place make with hand which be the figure of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of god for u nor yet that he should offer himself often a the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others for then must he often have suffer since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world hath he appear to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself and a it be appoint unto men once to die but after this the judgment so christ be once offer to bear the sin of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation for the law have shadow of good thing to come and not the very image of the thing can never with those sacrifice which they offer year by year continually make the comer thereunto perfect for then would they not have cease to be offer because that the worshipper once purge should have have no more conscience of sin but in those sacrifice there be remembrance again make of sin every year for it be not possible that the blood of bull and of goat should take away sin wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but body hast thou prepared me in burnt offering and sacrifice for sin thou hast have no pleasure then say lo come in the volume of the book it be write of me to do thy will god above when he say sacrifice and offering and burnt offering and offering for sin thou wouldest not neither hadst pleasure therein which be offer by the law then say he lo come to do thy will god he taketh away the first that he may establish the second by the which will we be sanctify through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all and every priest standeth daily minister and offering oftentimes the same sacrifice which can never take away sin but this man after he have offer one sacrifice for sin for ever sat down on the right hand of god from henceforth expect till his enemy be make his footstool for by one offering he hath perfect for ever them that be sanctify whereof the holy ghost also be witness to u for after that he have say before this be the covenant that will make with them after those day saith the lord will put my law into their heart and in their mind will write them and their sin and iniquity will remember no more now where remission of these be there be no more offering for sin have therefore brother boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus by new and living way which he hath consecrate for u through the veil that be to say his flesh and have an high priest over the house of god let u draw near with true heart in full assurance of faith have our heart sprinkle from an evil conscience and our body wash with pure water let u hold fast the profession of our faith without waver for he be faithful that promise and let u consider one another to provoke unto love and to good work not forsake the assemble of ourselves together a the manner of some be but exhort one another and so much the more a ye see the day approach for if we sin wilfully after that we have receive the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin but certain fearful look for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversary he that despise moses law die without mercy under two or three witness of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the son of god and hath count the blood of the covenant wherewith he be sanctify an unholy thing and hath do despite unto the spirit of grace for we know him that hath say vengeance belongeth unto me will recompense saith the lord and again the lord shall judge his people it be fearful thing to fall into the hand of the living god but call to remembrance the former day in which after ye be illuminate ye endure great fight of affliction partly whilst ye be make gazingstock both by reproach and affliction and partly whilst ye become companion of them that be so use for ye have compassion of me in my bond and take joyfully the spoil of your good know in yourselves that ye have in heaven well and an endure substance cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompence of reward for ye have need of patience that after ye have do the will of god ye might receive the promise for yet little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we be not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the save of the soul now faith be the substance of thing hop for the evidence of thing not see for by it the elder obtain good report through faith we understand that the world be frame by the word of god so that thing which be see be not make of thing which do appear by faith abel offer unto god more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtain witness that he be righteous god testify of his gift and by it he be dead yet speaketh by faith enoch be translate that he should not see death and be not found because god have translate him for before his translation he have this testimony that he pleased god but without faith it be impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he be and that he be rewarder of them that diligently seek him by faith noah be warn of god of thing not see a yet move with fear prepared an ark to the save of his house by the which he condemn the world and become heir of the righteousness which be by faith by faith abraham when he be call to go out into place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he go out not know whither he go by faith he sojourn in the land of promise a in strange country dwell in tabernacle with isaac and jacob the heir with him of the same promise for he look for city which hath foundation whose builder and maker be god through faith also sara herself receive strength to conceive seed and be deliver of child when she be past age because she judged him faithful who have promise therefore sprang there even of one and him a good a dead so many a the star of the sky in multitude and a the sand which be by the sea shore innumerable these all die in faith not have receive the promise but have see them afar off and be persuade of them and embrace them and confess that they be stranger and pilgrim on the earth for they that say such thing declare plainly that they seek country and truly if they have be mindful of that country from whence they come out they might have have opportunity to have return but now they desire well country that be an heavenly wherefore god be not ashamed to be call their god for he hath prepared for them city by faith abraham when he be try offer up isaac and he that have receive the promise offer up his only begotten son of whom it be say that in isaac shall thy seed be call accounting that god be able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he receive him in figure by faith isaac bless jacob and esau concern thing to come by faith jacob when he be die bless both the son of joseph and worship lean upon the top of his staff by faith joseph when he die make mention of the depart of the child of israel and give commandment concern his bone by faith moses when he be born be hid three month of his parent because they saw he be proper child and they be not afraid of the king commandment by faith moses when he be come to year refuse to be call the son of pharaoh daughter choose rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasure of sin for season esteem the reproach of christ great rich than the treasure in egypt for he have respect unto the recompence of the reward by faith he forsook egypt not fear the wrath of the king for he endure a see him who be invisible through faith he kept the passover and the sprinkle of blood l he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them by faith they pass through the red sea a by dry land which the egyptian assay to do be drown by faith the wall of jericho fell down after they be compass about seven day by faith the harlot rahab perish not with them that believe not when she have receive the spy with peace and what shall more say for the time would fail me to tell of gedeon and of barak and of samson and of jephthae of david also and samuel and of the prophet who through faith subdue kingdom wrought righteousness obtain promise stop the mouth of lion quenched the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword out of weakness be make strong waxed valiant in fight turn to flight the army of the alien woman receive their dead raise to life again and others be torture not accept deliverance that they might obtain well resurrection and others have trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yea moreover of bond and imprisonment they be stone they be sawn asunder be tempt be slain with the sword they wander about in sheepskin and goatskin be destitute afflict torment of whom the world be not worthy they wander in desert and in mountain and in den and cave of the earth and these all have obtain good report through faith receive not the promise god have provide some well thing for u that they without u should not be make perfect wherefore see we also be compass about with so great cloud of witness let u lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset u and let u run with patience the race that be set before u look unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that be set before him endure the cross despise the shame and be set down at the right hand of the throne of god for consider him that endure such contradiction of sinner against himself l ye be weary and faint in your mind ye have not yet resist unto blood strive against sin and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you a unto child my son despise not thou the chasten of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuke of him for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if ye endure chasten god dealeth with you a with son for what son be he whom the father chasteneth not but if ye be without chastisement whereof all be partaker then be ye bastard and not son furthermore we have have father of our flesh which correct u and we give them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirit and live for they verily for few day chasten u after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partaker of his holiness now no chasten for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which be exercise thereby wherefore lift up the hand which hang down and the feeble knee and make straight path for your foot l that which be lame be turn out of the way but let it rather be heal follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the lord look diligently l any man fail of the grace of god l any root of bitterness spring up trouble you and thereby many be defile l there be any fornicator or profane person a esau who for one morsel of meat sell his birthright for ye know how that afterward when he would have inherit the blessing he be reject for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tear for ye be not come unto the mount that might be touch and that burn with fire nor unto blackness and darkness and tempest and the sound of trumpet and the voice of word which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more for they could not endure that which be command and if so much a beast touch the mountain it shall be stone or thrust through with dart and so terrible be the sight that moses say exceedingly fear and quake but ye be come unto mount sion and unto the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angel to the general assembly and church of the firstborn which be write in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirit of just men make perfect and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkle that speaketh well thing that that of abel see that ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escape not who refuse him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promise say yet once more shake not the earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signifieth the remove of those thing that be shaken a of thing that be make that those thing which cannot be shaken may remain wherefore we receive kingdom which cannot be move let u have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our god be consume fire let brotherly love continue be not forgetful to entertain stranger for thereby some have entertain angel unawares remember them that be in bond a bound with them and them which suffer adversity a be yourselves also in the body marriage be honourable in all and the bed undefiled but whoremonger and adulterer god will judge let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such thing a ye have for he hath say will never leave thee nor forsake thee so that we may boldly say the lord be my helper and will not fear what man shall do unto me remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of god whose faith follow consider the end of their conversation jesus christ the same yesterday and to day and for ever be not carry about with diver and strange doctrine for it be good thing that the heart be establish with grace not with meat which have not profit them that have be occupy therein we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle for the body of those beast whose blood be brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin be burn without the camp wherefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffer without the gate let u go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach for here have we no continue city but we seek one to come by him therefore let u offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually that be the fruit of our lip give thanks to his name but to do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifice god be well pleased obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your soul a they that must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that be unprofitable for you pray for u for we trust we have good conscience in all thing willing to live honestly but beseech you the rather to do this that may be restore to you the sooner now the god of peace that brought again from the dead our lord jesus that great shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the everlasting covenant make you perfect in every good work to do his will work in you that which be wellpleasing in his sight through jesus christ to whom be glory for ever and ever amen and beseech you brother suffer the word of exhortation for have write letter unto you in few word know ye that our brother timothy be set at liberty with whom if he come shortly will see you salute all them that have the rule over you and all the saint they of italy salute you grace be with you all amen book james james servant of god and of the lord jesus christ to the twelve tribe which be scatter abroad greet my brother count it all joy when ye fall into diver temptation know this that the try of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire want nothing if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be give him but let him ask in faith nothing waver for he that wavereth be like wave of the sea driven with the wind and toss for let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the lord double mind man be unstable in all his way let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he be exalt but the rich in that he be make low because a the flower of the grass he shall pas away for the sun be no sooner risen with burning heat but it withereth the grass and the flower thereof falleth and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth so also shall the rich man fade away in his way bless be the man that endureth temptation for when he be try he shall receive the crown of life which the lord hath promise to them that love him let no man say when he be tempt be tempt of god for god cannot be tempt with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man be tempt when he be drawn away of his own lust and entice then when lust hath conceive it bringeth forth sin and sin when it be finish bringeth forth death do not err my beloved brother every good gift and every perfect gift be from above and cometh down from the father of light with whom be no variableness neither shadow of turn of his own will begat he u with the word of truth that we should be kind of firstfruits of his creature wherefore my beloved brother let every man be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of god wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engraft word which be able to save your soul but be ye doer of the word and not hearer only deceive your own self for if any be hearer of the word and not doer he be like unto man beholding his natural face in glass for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he be but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continueth therein he be not forgetful hearer but doer of the work this man shall be bless in his deed if any man among you seem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his own heart this man religion be vain pure religion and undefiled before god and the father be this to visit the fatherless and widow in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world my brother have not the faith of our lord jesus christ the lord of glory with respect of person for if there come unto your assembly man with gold ring in goodly apparel and there come in also poor man in vile raiment and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing and say unto him sit thou here in good place and say to the poor stand thou there or sit here under my footstool be ye not then partial in yourselves and be become judge of evil thought hearken my beloved brother hath not god chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and heir of the kingdom which he hath promise to them that love him but ye have despise the poor do not rich men oppress you and draw you before the judgment seat do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye be call if ye fulfil the royal law accord to the scripture thou shalt love thy neighbour a thyself ye do well but if ye have respect to person ye commit sin and be convince of the law a transgressor for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he be guilty of all for he that say do not commit adultery say also do not kill now if thou commit no adultery yet if thou kill thou art become transgressor of the law so speak ye and so do a they that shall be judged by the law of liberty for he shall have judgment without mercy that hath shew no mercy and mercy rejoiceth against judgment what doth it profit my brother though man say he hath faith and have not work can faith save him if brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food and one of you say unto them depart in peace be ye warm and fill notwithstanding ye give them not those thing which be needful to the body what doth it profit even so faith if it hath not work be dead be alone yea man may say thou hast faith and have work shew me thy faith without thy work and will shew thee my faith by my work thou believest that there be one god thou doest well the devil also believe and tremble but wilt thou know vain man that faith without work be dead be not abraham our father justified by work when he have offer isaac his son upon the altar seest thou how faith wrought with his work and by work be faith make perfect and the scripture be fulfil which saith abraham believe god and it be impute unto him for righteousness and he be call the friend of god ye see then how that by work man be justified and not by faith only likewise also be not rahab the harlot justified by work when she have receive the messenger and have sent them out another way for a the body without the spirit be dead so faith without work be dead also my brother be not many master know that we shall receive the great condemnation for in many thing we offend all if any man offend not in word the same be perfect man and able also to bridle the whole body behold we put bit in the horse mouth that they may obey u and we turn about their whole body behold also the ship which though they be so great and be driven of fierce wind yet be they turn about with very small helm whithersoever the governor listeth even so the tongue be little member and boasteth great thing behold how great matter little fire kindleth and the tongue be fire world of iniquity so be the tongue among our member that it defileth the whole body and setteth on fire the course of nature and it be set on fire of hell for every kind of beast and of bird and of serpent and of thing in the sea be tame and hath be tame of mankind but the tongue can no man tame it be an unruly evil full of deadly poison therewith bless we god even the father and therewith curse we men which be make after the similitude of god out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and curse my brother these thing ought not so to be doth fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter can the fig tree my brother bear olive berry either vine fig so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh who be wise man and endue with knowledge among you let him shew out of good conversation his work with meekness of wisdom but if ye have bitter envy and strife in your heart glory not and lie not against the truth this wisdom descendeth not from above but be earthly sensual devilish for where envy and strife be there be confusion and every evil work but the wisdom that be from above be first pure then peaceable gentle and easy to be intreated full of mercy and good fruit without partiality and without hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness be sown in peace of them that make peace from whence come war and fighting among you come they not hence even of your lust that war in your member ye lust and have not ye kill and desire to have and cannot obtain ye fight and war yet ye have not because ye ask not ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss that ye may consume it upon your lust ye adulterer and adulteress know ye not that the friendship of the world be enmity with god whosoever therefore will be friend of the world be the enemy of god do ye think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in u lusteth to envy but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith god resisteth the proud but giveth grace unto the humble submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from you draw nigh to god and he will draw nigh to you cleanse your hand ye sinner and purify your heart ye double mind be afflict and mourn and weep let your laughter be turn to mourn and your joy to heaviness humble yourselves in the sight of the lord and he shall lift you up speak not evil one of another brother he that speaketh evil of his brother and judgeth his brother speaketh evil of the law and judgeth the law but if thou judge the law thou art not doer of the law but judge there be one lawgiver who be able to save and to destroy who art thou that judgest another go to now ye that say to day or to morrow we will go into such city and continue there year and buy and sell and get gain whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow for what be your life it be even vapour that appeareth for little time and then vanisheth away for that ye ought to say if the lord will we shall live and do this or that but now ye rejoice in your boasting all such rejoice be evil therefore to him that knoweth to

who be go into heaven and be on the right hand of god angel and authority and power be make subject unto him forasmuch then a christ hath suffer for u in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffer in the flesh hath cease from sin that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lust of men but to the will of god for the time past of our life may suffice u to have wrought the will of the gentile when we walk in lasciviousness lust excess of wine revellings banqueting and abominable idolatry wherein they think it strange that ye run

yet if any man suffer a christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify god on this behalf for the time be come that judgment must begin at the house of god and if it first begin at u what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of god and if the righteous scarcely be save where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear wherefore let them that suffer accord to the will of god commit the keep of their soul to him in well do a unto faithful creator the elder which be among you exhort who be also an elder and witness of the suffering of christ and also partaker of the glory that shall be reveal feed the flock of god which be among you take the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly not for filthy lucre but of ready mind neither a be lord over god heritage but be
