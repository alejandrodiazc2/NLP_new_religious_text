**Religious Texts For All**

Git Repository Link: https://git.arts.ac.uk/alejandrozipa/NLP_Project1_online


According to a global poll in 2012 by WIN-Gallup International, 59% of the world said that they think of themselves as religious person, 23% think of themselves as not religious whereas 13% think of themselves as convinced atheists.1 This sums up to almost two thirds of all humans. Most religions are based on scriptures and texts that have been passed generation to generation, creating a huge database of moral and lifestyle rules and stories. It would take a lifetime to study all these religions and their respective textbooks, so the main goal of this project is to analyze them with the several NLP methods were given to us this term, such as Topic Modelling, Sentiment Analisis and Markov Chains and try find similarities and differences between each other. Also, I wanted to create a ‘inter-religious’ text for my artistic investigation.

 To do this project, I've chosen 8 religious books or compilation of texts as datasets for this project.

 The texts I have chosen are:
  
 The King James Version Bible (Christianity)
 The Quran (Islam)
 The Bhagavad Gita (Hinduism)
 Tripitaka (Buddhism)
 Hebrew Bible (Judaism)
 Bahá'í Writings (Bahá'í Faith)
 TAO TE CHING (Taoism)
 Kojiki Texts (Shinto).

 The NLP techniques I have used are:

 Web scraping with Beatiful Soup (Web-scraping folder)
 Cleaning text with regex (Cleaning_files ipynb)
 Word Count and Word Cloud 
 Sentiment Analysis
 LSA Topics
 Markov Chains

 I would like to think that as humans, independent of our cultural background, we all thrive towards the same goals. In my opinion, even though religions have made many societies thrive and were completely necessary to current society evolution, they have also created and widened gaps. On several occasions, these texts have been misinterpreted and used as an excuse for fulfilling private interests.  A main goal of my artistic research is to find the similarities and differences between these texts.

 In conclusion it was a very interesting insight of NLP and the various tools it provides for analyzing data. I tried my best to utilize most of the notebooks given to us throughout the term in order to understand the entire process better. Even though I found interesting results, I would need more time to fine-tune all the tools.  

I have now a glimpse of an immensely powerful investigation tool, that provides a lot of information about a certain subject, and that can be easily used in connection with other artistic projects. Even though some of the results weren’t what I expected, I am very happy with the process and the new horizons these techniques bring to my research. 

 Thanks you for reading.
