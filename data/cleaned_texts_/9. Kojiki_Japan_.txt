the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com of all the mass of japanese literature which lies before us as the result of nearly twelve centuries of book making the most important monument is the work entitled ko ji ki or records of ancient matters which was completed in it is the most important because it has preserved for us more faithfully than any other book the mythology the manners the language ii paragraph continues and the traditional history of ancient japan indeed it is the earliest authentic connected literary product of that large division of the human race which has been variously denominated turanian scythian and altaic and it even precedes by at least century the most ancient extant literary compositions of non aryan india soon after the date of its compilation most of the salient features of distinctive japanese nationality were buried under superincumbent mass of chinese culture and it is to these records and to very small number of other ancient works such as the poems of the collection of myriad leaves and the shintō rituals that the investigator must look if he would not at every step be misled in attributing originality to modern customs and ideas which have simply been borrowed wholesale from the neighbouring continent it is of course not pretended that even these records are untouched by chinese influence that influence is patent in the very characters with which the text is written but the influence is less and of another kind if in the traditions preserved and in the customs alluded to we detect the early japanese in the act of borrowing from china and perhaps even from india there is at least on our author part no ostentatious decking out in chinese trappings of what he believed to be original matter after the fashion of the writers who immediately succeeded him it is true that this abstinence on his part makes his compilation less pleasant to the ordinary native taste than that of subsequent historians who put fine chinese phrases into the mouths of emperors and heroes supposed to have lived before the time when intercourse with china began but the european student iii who reads all such books not as pastime but in order to search for facts will prefer the more genuine composition it is also accorded the first place by the most learned of the nativeliterati of late years this paramount importance of the records of ancient matters to investigators of japanese subjects generally has become well known to european scholars and even versions of few passages are to be found scattered through the pages of their writings thus mr aston has given us in the chrestomathy appended to his grammar of the japanese written language couple of interesting extracts mr satow has illustrated by occasional extracts his elaborate papers on the shintō rituals printed in these transactions and remarkable essay by mr kempermann published in the fourth number of the mittheilungen der deutschen gesellschaft für natur und völkerkunde ostasiens though containing no actual translations bases on the account given in the records some conjectures regarding theoriginesof japanese civilization which are fully substantiated by more minute research all that has yet appeared in any european language does not however amount to one twentieth part of the whole and the most erroneous views of the style and scope of the book and its contents have found their way into popular works on japan it is hoped that the true nature of the book and also the true nature of the traditions customs and ideas of the early japanese will be made clearer by the present translation the object of which is to give the entire work in continuous english version and thus to furnish the european student with text to quote from or at least to use as guide in consulting the original the only object aimed iv at has been rigid and literal conformity with the japanese text fortunately for this endeavour though less fortunately for the student one of the difficulties which often beset the translator of an oriental classic is absent in the present case there is no beauty of style to preserve some trace of which he may be tempted to sacrifice certain amount of accuracy the records sound queer and bald in japanese as will be noticed further on and it is therefore right even from stylistic point of view that they should sound bald and queer in english the only portions of the text which from obvious reasons refuse to lend themselves to translation into english after this fashion are the indecent portions but it has been thought that there could be no objection to rendering them into latin —latin as rigidly literal as is the english of the greater part after these preliminary remarks it will be most convenient to take the several points which study of the records and the turning of them into english suggest and to consider the same one by one these points are —authenticity and nature of the text together with bibliographical notes ii —details concerning the method of translation iii —the nihon gi or chronicles of japan iv —manners and customs of the early japanese —religious and political ideas of the early japanese beginnings of the japanese nation and credibility of the national traditions should the claim of accadian to be considered an altaic language be substantiated then archaic japanese will have to be content with the second place in the altaic family taking the word altaic in its usual acceptation viz as the generic name of all the languages belonging to the mantchu mongolia turkish and finnish groups not only the archaic but the classical literature of japan carries us back several centuries beyond the earliest extant documents of any other altaic tongue —for discussion of the age of the most ancient tamil documents see the introduction to bishop caldwell comparative grammar of the dravidian languages et seq next the text and its authenticity together with bibliographical notes the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com the latter portion of the preface to the records of ancient matters is the only documentary authority for the origin of the work it likewise explains its scope but though in so doing the author descends to more matter of fact style than the high sounding chinese phrases and elaborate allusions with which he had set forth still his meaning may be found to lack somewhat of clearness and it will be as well to have the facts put into language more intelligible to the european student this having already been done by mr satow in his paper on the revival of pure shintō it will be best simply to quote his words they are as follows the emperor temmu at what portion of his reign is not mentioned lamenting that the records possessed by the chief families contained many errors resolved to take steps to preserve the true traditions from oblivion he therefore had the records carefully examined compared and weeded of their faults there happened to be in his household person of marvellous memory named hiyeda no are who could repeat without mistake the contents of any document he had ever seen and never forgot anything that he had heard temmu tennō took the pains to instruct this person in the genuine traditions and old language of former ages and to make him repeat them until he had the whole by heart before the undertaking was completed which probably means before it could be committed to writing vi the emperor died and for twenty five years are memory was the sole depository of what afterwards received the title ofkojiki orfuru koto bumias it is read by motoori at the end of this interval the empress gemmiō ordered yasumaro to write it down from the mouth of are which accounts for the completion of the manuscript in so short time as four months and half are age at this date is not stated but as he was twenty eight years of age some time in the reign of temmu tennō it could not possibly have been more than sixty eight while taking into account the previous order of temmu tennō in for the compilation of history and the statement that he was engaged on the composition of the kojiki at the time of his death in it would not be unreasonable to conclude that it belongs to about the last year of his reign in which case are was only fifty three in the previous order of the emperor temmu mentioned in the above extract is usually supposed to have resulted in the compilation of history which was early lost but hirata gives reasons for supposing that this and the project of the records of ancient matters were identical if this opinion be accepted the records while the oldestexistingjapanese book are not the third but the second historical work of which mention has been preserved one such having been compiled in the year but lost in fire in the year it will thus be seen that it is rather hard to say whom we should designate as the author of the work vii paragraph continues the emperor tem mu hiyeda no are yasumaro may all three lay claim to the title the question however is of no importance to us and the share taken by are may well have been exaggerated in the telling what seems to remain as the residue of fact is that the plan of purely national history originated with the emperor temmu and was finally carried out under his successor by yasumaro one of the court nobles fuller evidence and confirmatory evidence from other sources as to the origin of our records would doubtless be very acceptable but the very small number of readers and writers at that early date and the almost simultaneous compilation of history the chronicles of japan which was better calculated to bit the taste of the age make the absence of such evidence almost unavoidable in any case and only noticing in passing the fact that japan was never till quite recent years noted for such wholesale literary forgeries for motowori condemnation of the chronicles of old matters of former ages has been considered rash by later scholars —it cannot be too much emphasized that in this instance authenticity is sufficiently proved by internal evidence it is hard to believe that any forger living later than the eighth century of our era should have been so well able to discard the chinese padding to the old traditions which after the acceptance by the court of the chronicles of japan had come to be generally regarded as an integral portion of those very traditions and it is more unlikely still that he should have invented style so little calculated to bring his handiwork into repute he would either have written in fair chinese like the mass of early japanese prose writers and his preface viii shows that he could do so if he were so minded or if the tradition of there having been history written in the native tongue had reached him he would have made his composition unmistakably japanese in form by arranging consistent use of characters employed phonetically to denote particles and terminations after the fashion followed in the rituals and developed apparently before the close of the ninth century into what is technically known as the mixed phonetic style kana mazhiri which has remained ever since as the most convenient vehicle for writing the language as it is his quasi chinese construction which breaks down every now and then to be helped up again by few japanese words written phonetically is surely the first clumsy attempt at combining two divergent elements what however is simply incredible is that if the supposed forger lived even only hundred years later than he should so well have imitated or divined the archaisms of that early period for the eighth century of our era was great turning point in the japanese language the archaic dialect being then replaced by the classical and as the chinese language and literature were alone thenceforward considered worthy the student attention there was no means of keeping up an acquaintance with the diction of earlier reigns neither do we find the poets of the time ever attempting to adorn their verse with obsolete phraseology that was an affectation reserved for later epoch when the diffusion of books rendered it possible the poets of the seventh eighth and ninth centuries apparently wrote as they spoke and the test of language alone would almost allow of our arranging their compositions half century by half century even without the dates ix which are given in many instances in the collection of myriad leaves and in the collection of songs ancient and modern —the first two collections of poems published by imperial decree in the middle of the eighth and at the commencement of the tenth century respectively the above remarks are meant to apply more especially to the occasional japanese words —all of them archaic —which as mentioned above are used from time to time in the prose text of the records to help out the author meaning and to preserve names whose exact pronunciation he wished handed down that he should have invented the songs would be too monstrous supposition for any one to entertain even if we had not many of the same and other similar ones preserved in the pages of the chronicles of japan work which was undoubtedly completed in the history of the japanese language is too well known to us we can trace its development and decay in too many documents reaching from the eighth century to the present time for it to be possible to entertain the notion that the latest of these songs which have been handed down with minute care in syllabic transcription is posterior to the first half of the eighth century while the majority must be ascribed to an earlier though uncertain date if we refer the greater number of them in their present form to the sixth century and allow further antiquity of one or two centuries to others more ancient in sentiment and in grammatical usage we shall probably be making moderate estimate it is an estimate moreover which obtains confirmation from the fact that the first notice we have of the use of writing in japan dates from early in the fifth century for it is natural to suppose that the songs believed to have been composed by the gods and heroes of antiquity should have been among the first things to be written down while the reverence in which they were held would in some cases cause them to be transcribed exactly as tradition had bequeathed them even if unintelligible or nearly so while in others the same feeling would lead to the correction of what were supposed to be errors or inelegancies finally it may be well to observe that the authenticity of the records has never been doubted though as has already been stated some of the native commentators have not hesitated to charge with spuriousness another of their esteemed ancient histories now it is unlikely that in the war which has been waged between the partisans of the records and those of the chronicles some flaw in the former title to genuineness and to priority should not have been discovered and pointed out if it existed during the middle ages when no native japanese works were printed and not many others excepting the chinese classics and buddhist scriptures the records of ancient matters remained in manuscript in the hands of the shintō priesthood they were first printed in the year at the time when peace having been finally restored to the country and the taste for reading become diffused the great mass of the native literature first began to emerge from the manuscript state this very rare edition which was reprinted in facsimile in is indispensable to any one who would make of the records special study the next edition was by shintō priest deguchi nobuyoshi and appeared in it has marginal xi notes of no great value and several emendations of the text the first mentioned of these two editions is commonly called the old printed edition but has no title beyond that of the original work records of ancient matters with marginal readings each is in three volumes they were succeeded in by motowori great edition entitled exposition of the records of ancient matters this which is perhaps the most admirable work of which japanese erudition can boast consists of forty four large volumes fifteen of which are devoted to the elucidation of the first volume of the original seventeen to the second ten to the third and the rest to prolegomena indexes etc to the ordinary student this commentary will furnish all that he requires and the charm of motowori style will be found to shed glamour over the driest parts of the original work the author judgment only seems to fail him occasionally when confronted with the most difficult or corrupt passages or with such as might be construed in sense unfavourable to his predilections as an ardent shintoist he frequently quotes the opinions of his master mabuchi whose own treatise on this subject is so rare that the present writer has never seen copy of it nor does the public library of tōkyō possess one later and less important editions are the records of ancient matters with the ancient reading reprint by one of motowori pupils of the chinese text and of his master skanareading of it without his commentary and useful for reference though the title is misnomer

volumes by fujihara no masaoki entitled the records of ancient matters in the divine character is real curiosity of literature though otherwise of no value in it the editor has been at the pains of reproducing the whole work according to its modernkanareading in that adaptation of the korean alphabetic writing which some modern japanese authors have supposed to be characters of peculiar age and sanctity used by the ancient gods oftheircountry and naméd divine characters accordingly besides these actual editions of the records of ancient matters there is considerable mass of literature bearing less directly on the same work and all of which cannot be here enumerated it may be sufficient to mention the correct account of the divine age by motowori vols and commentary thereon entitled

atsutane begun printing in —works which are specially admirable from philological point of view and in which the student will find xiii the solution of not few difficulties which even to motowori had been insuperable the idzu no chi waki by tachibana no moribe begun printing in useful commentary on the chronicles of japan the idzu no koto waki by the same author begun printing in an invaluable help to comprehension of the songs contained in both the records and the chronicles the examination of difficult words also entitled in vols sort of dictionary of specially perplexing terms and phrases in which light is thrown on many verbal crux and much originality of thought displayed and the perpetual commentary on the chronicles of japan by tanigaha shisei painstaking work written in the chinese language vols neither must the kō gan shō commentary on the songs contained in the chronicles and records composed by the buddhist priest keichiū who may be termed the father of the native school of criticism be forgotten it is true that most of keichiū judgments on doubtful points have been superseded by the more perfect erudition of later days but some few of his interpretations may still be followed with advantage the kō gan shō which was finished in the year has never been printed it is from these and few others and from the standard dictionaries and general books of reference such as the japanese words classified and xiv paragraph continues explained the catalogue of family names and coming down to more modern times arawi hakuseki tōga that the translator has derived most assistance the majority of the useful quotations from the dictionaries etc having been incorporated by motowori in his commentary it has not often been necessary to mention them by name in the notes to the translation at the same time the translator must express his conviction that as the native authorities cannot possibly be dispensed with so also must their assertions be carefully weighed and only accepted with discrimination by the critical european investigator he must also thank mr tachibana no chimori grandson of the eminent scholar tachibana no moribe for kindly allowing him to make use of the unpublished portions of the idzu no chi waki and the idzu no katō waki works indispensable to the comprehension of the more difficult portion of the text of the records to mr satow he is indebted for the english and latin equivalents of the japanese botanical names to capt blakiston and mr namiye motokichi for similar assistance with regard to the zoological names comparing what has been said above with what the author tells us in his preface the nature of the text so far as language is concerned will be easily understood the songs are written phonetically syllable by syllable in what is technically known asmanyō gana entire chinese characters used to represent sound and not sense the rest of the text which is in prose is very poor chinese capable owing to the ideographic nature of the chinese written character of being read off into japanese it is also not only full of japonisms but xv irregularly interspersed with characters which turn the text into nonsense for chinaman as they are used phonetically to represent certain japanese words for which the author could not find suitable chinese equivalents these phonetically written words prove even apart from the notice in the preface that the text was never meant to be read as pure chinese the probability is that sense being considered more important than sound it was read partly in chinese and partly in japanese according to mode which has since been systematized and has become almost universal in this country even in the reading of genuine chinese texts the modern school of japaneseliterati who push their hatred of everything foreign to the bounds of fanaticism contend however that this their most ancient and revered book was from the first intended to be read exclusively into japanese drawing from the other sources of our knowledge of the archaic dialect motowori has even hazarded restoration of the japanese reading of the entire prose text in the whole of which not single chinese word is used excepting for the titles of the two chinese books the confucian analects and the thousand character essay which are said to have been brought over to japan in the reign of the emperor jin and for the names of korean king and of three or four other xvi paragraph continues koreans and chinese whatever may be their opinion on the question at issue most european scholars to whom the superior sanctity of the japanese language is not an article of faith will probably agree with mr aston in denying to this conjectural restoration the credit of representing the genuine words into which japanese eighth century students of history read off the text of the records published in vol iii pt of these transactions the emperor tem mu vi records of ancient matters the alternative reading which is probably but an invention of motowori gives the same meaning in pure japanese instead of sinico japanese sounds xiii unfortunately the portion already printed does not carry the history down even to the close of the divine age the work is as colossal in extent as it is minute in research forty one volumes including the eleven forming the sources having already appeared the idzu no chi waki and idzu no koto waki are similarly incomplete xiv xvthe translator adopts the term ideographic because it is that commonly used and understood and because this is not the place to demonstrate its inappropriateness strictly speaking logographic would be preferable to ideographic the difference between chinese characters and alphabetic writing being that the former represent in their entirety the chinese words for things and ideas whereas the latter dissects into their component sounds the words of the languages which it is employed to write xvi grammar of the japanese written language second edition appendix ii vi next ii methods of translation the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com to the translator the question above mooted is not one of great importance the text itself must form the basis of his version and not any one —not even motowori s—private and particular reading of it for this reason none of the honorifics which motowori inserts as prefixes to nouns and terminations to verbs have been taken any notice of but the original has been followed character by character with as great fidelity as was attainable the author too has his honorifics but he does not use them so plentifully or so regularly as it pleases motowori to represent him as having intended to do on the other hand motowori occasional emendations of the text may generally be accepted they rarely extend to more than single words and the errors in the earlier editions may frequently be shown to have arisen from careless copying of characters originally written not in the square but in the cursive form the translator has separately considered each case where various readings xvii occur and has mentioned them in the notes when they seemed of sufficient importance in some few cases he has preferred reading not approved by motowori but he always mentions motowori reading in foot note the main body of the text contains but little to perplex any one who has made special study of the early japanese writings and it has already been noticed that there is an admirable exegetical literature at the student command with the songs embedded in the prose text the case is different as some of them are among the most difficult things in the language and the commentators frequently arrive at most discordant interpretations of the obscurer passages in the present version particulars concerning each song have except in very few cases where comment appeared superfluous been given in foot note the general sense being usually first indicated the meaning of particular expressions then explained and various opinions mentioned when they seemed worthy of notice besides one or two terms of japanese grammar the only technical knowledge with which the readers of the notes are necessarily credited is that of the use by the japanese poets of what have been styled pillow words pivots and prefaces and those pillow words which are founded on ajeu de motsor are of doubtful signification form with the one exception mentioned below the only case where anything contained in the original is omitted from the english version after some consideration it has been deemed xviii advisable to print in an appendix the japanese text of all the songs transliterated into roman students will thus find it easier to form their own opinion on the interpretation of doubtful passages the importance likewise of these songs as the most ancient specimens of altaic speech makes it right to give them as much publicity as possible the text of the records is like many other japanese texts completely devoid of breaks corresponding to the chapters and paragraphs into which european works are divided with the occasional exception of pause after catalogue of gods or princes and of notes inserted in smaller type and generally containing genealogies or indicating the pronunciation of certain words the whole story prose and verse runs on from beginning to end with no interruptions other than those marked by the conclusion of vol and by the death of each emperor in vols ii and iii faithfulness however scarcely seems to demand more than this statement for similarly continuous printing of the english version would attain no end but that of making very dry piece of reading more arduous still moreover there are certain traditional names by which the various episodes of the so called divine age are known to the native scholars and according to which the text of vol may naturally be divided the reigns of the emperors form similar foundation for the analysis of vols ii and iii which contain the account of the human age it has been thought that it would be well to mark such natural divisions by the use of numbered sections with marginal headings the titles proposed by motowori in the prolegomena to his commentary have been adopted with xix scarcely any alteration in the case of vol in vols ii and iii where his sections mostly embrace the whole reign of an emperor and the title given by him to each section consists only of the name of the palace where each emperor is said to have resided there is less advantage in following him for those sections are often inordinately long and their titles occasionally misleading and always inconvenient for purposes of reference as the japanese emperors are commonly known not by the names of their places of residence but by their canonical names motowori as an ardent nationalist of course rejected these canonical names because they were first applied to the japanese emperors at comparatively late date in imitation of chinese usage but to foreigner this need be no sufficient reason for discarding them the sections in the translation of vols ii and iii have therefore been obtained by breaking up the longer reigns into appropriate portions and in such sections as also in the foot notes the emperors are always mentioned by their canonical names the vol mentioned in brackets on every right hand page is that of motowori commentary which treats of the section contained in that page the notes translated from the original are indented and are printed small when they are in small type in xx the japanese text those only which give directions for pronouncing certain characters phonetically have been omitted as they have no significance when the original tongue and method of writing are exchanged for foreign vehicles of thought and expression the songs have likewise been indented for the sake of clearness and each one printed as separate paragraph the occasionally unavoidable insertion in the translation of important words not occurring in the japanese text has been indicated by printing such words within square brackets the translator notes which figure at the bottom of each page do not aim at anything more than the exegesis of the actual text to illustrate its subject matter from other sources as motowori does and to enlarge on all the subjects connected with japanese antiquity which are sometimes merely alluded to in single phrase would require several more volumes the size of this one many years of labour on the part of the investigator and an unusually large stock of patience on the reader part the notes terminate with the death of the emperor kenzō after which the text ceases to offer any interest except as comment on the genealogies given in the chronicles of japan without forgetting the fact that so called equivalent terms in two languages rarely quite cover each other and that it may therefore be necessary in some cases to render one japanese word by two or three different english words according to the context the translator has striven to keep such diversity within the narrowest limits as it tends to give false impression of the original implying that it possesses versatility of thought which is indeed characteristic of modern europe but not xxi at all of early japan with reference to this point certain class of words must be mentioned as the english translation is unavoidably defective in their case owing to the fact of our language not possessing sufficiently close synonyms for them they are chiefly the names of titles and are the following agata no atahe roughly rendered by departmental suzerain agata nushi departmental lord asomi ason court noble atahe suzerain hiko prince hime princess inaki territorial lord iratsuko lord iratsume lady kami deity kimi duke ma true miko king mi ko august child mikoto augustness miyatsuko ruler murazhi chief omi grandee sukune noble wake in the names of human beings lord it must be understood that no special significance is to be attached to the use of such words as duke suzerain etc they are merely so to speak labels by which titles that are distinct in the original are sought to be kept distinct in the translation many of them also are used as that species of hereditary titular designation which the translator has ventured to call the gentile name where possible indeed the etymological xxii meaning of the japanese word has been preserved thusomiseems to be rightly derived by motowori fromohomi great body and grandee is therefore the nearest english equivalent similarlymurazhi chief is corruption of two words signifying master of tribe on the other hand both the etymology and the precise import of the title ofwakeare extremely doubtful hikoandhimeagain if they really come fromhi ko sun child andhi me sun female or fire child and fire female have wandered so far from their origin as even in archaic times to have been nothing more than honorific appellations corresponding in loose fashion to the english words prince and princess or lord and lady —in some cases perhaps meaning scarcely more than youth and maiden the four wordskami ma mikoandmikotoalone call for special notice andmamay be disposed of first it is of uncertain origin but identified by the native philologists with the perpetually recurring honorificmi rendered august as when written ideographically it is always represented by the chinese character the translator renders it in english by true but it must be understood that this word has no force beyond that of an honorific mikoto rendered augustness is properly compound mi koto august thing it is used as title somewhat after the fashion of our words majesty and highness being suffixed to the names of exalted human personages and also of gods and goddesses for the sake of clearness in the english translation this title is prefixed and used with the possessive pronoun thus yamato take no mikoto his augustness yamato take xxiii with regard to the title readmikoby the native commentators it is represented in two ways in the chinese text when ayoungprince is denoted by it we find the characters august child reminding us of the spanish title ofinfante but in other cases it is written with the single character king and it may be questioned whether the reading of it asmikois not arbitrary many indications lead us to suppose that in early japan something similar to the feudal system which again obtained during the middle ages was in force and if so then some of these kings may have been kings indeed after fashion and to degrade their title as do the modern commentators to that of prince is an anachronism in any case the safest plan if we would not help to obscure this interesting political question is to adhere to the proper signification of the character in the text and that character is king of all the words for which it is hard to find suitable english equivalent kamiis the hardest indeed there is no english word which renders it with any near approach to exactness if therefore it is here rendered by the word deity deity being preferred to god because it includes superior beings of both sexes it must be clearly understood that the word deity is taken in sense not sanctioned by any english dictionary forkami and deity or god only correspond to each other in very rough manner the proper meaning of the word kami is top or above and it is still constantly so used for this reason it has the secondary sense of hair of the head and only the hair on thetop xxiv of the head —not the hair on the face —is so designated similarly the government in popular phraseology iso kami literally the honorably above and down to few years agokamiwas the name of certain titular provincial rank thus it may be understood how the word was naturally applied to superiors in general and especially to those more than human superiors whom we call gods japanese to whom the origin of the word is patent and who uses it every day in contexts by no means divine does not receive from the wordkamithe same impression of awe which is produced on the more earnest european mind by the words deity and god with their very different associations in using the word deity therefore to translate the japanese termkamiwe must so to speak bring it down from the heights to which western thought has raised it in factkamidoes not mean much more than superior this subject will be noticed again in section of the present introduction but so far as the wordkamiitself is concerned these remarks may suffice to conclude this section the translator must advert to his treatment of proper names and he feels that he must plead guilty to certain amount of inconsistency on this head indeed the treatment of proper names is always an embarrassment partly because it is often difficult to determine what is proper name and partly because in translating text into foreign tongue proper names whose meanings are evident in the original and perhaps have bearing on the story lose their significance and the translator has therefore first of all to decide whether the name is really proper name at all or simply description of the personage or place xxv and next whether he will sacrifice the meaning because the word is used as name or preserve the original name and thus fail to render the meaning —a meaning which may be of importance as revealing the channels in which ancient thought flowed for instance oho kuni nushi no kami the deity master of the great land is clearly nothing more than description of the god in question who had several other names and the reason of whose adoption of this special one was that the sovereignty of the great land of japan or rather of idzumo and the neighbouring provinces in north western japan was ceded to him by another god whom he deceived and whose daughter he ran away with againtoyo ashi hara no chi aki no naga ho aki no midzu ho no kuni which signifies the luxuriant reed moor the land of fresh rice ears —of thousand autumns —of long five hundred autumns cannot possibly be regarded as more than an honorificdescriptionof japan such catalogue of words could never have been used as name on the other hand it is plain thattemawas simply the proper name of certain mountain because there is no known word in archaic japanese to which it can with certainty be traced the difficulty is with the intermediate cases —the cases of those names which are but partly comprehensible or partly applicable to their bearers and the difficulty is one of which there would seem to be no satisfactory solution possible the translator may therefore merely state that in vol of these records where an unusual number of the proper names have bearing on the legends related in the text he has wherever feasible translated all those which xxvi are borne by persons whether human or divine in the succeeding volumes he has not done so nor has he except in very small number of instances translated the proper names of places in any of the three volumes in order however to convey all the needful information

the records of ancient matters do not stand alone to say nothing of the chronicles of old matters of former age whose genuineness is disputed there is another undoubtedly authentic work with which no

completely chinese —in fact to great extent cento of well worn chinese xxvii phrases —but the subject matter is touched up re arranged and polished so as to make the work resemble chinese history so

with speeches made up of quotations from the yi ching the li chi and other standard chinese works few of the most childish of the national traditions are omitted for instance the story of the white hare of inaba that of the gods obtaining counsel of toad and that of the hospitality which speaking mouse extended to the deity master of the great land sometimes the original tradition is simply softened down or explained away notable instance of this occurs in the account of the visit of the deity izanagi to hades whither he goes in quest of his dead wife and among other things has to scale the even pass or hill of hades in the tradition preserved in the records and indeed even in the chronicles this pass or hill is mentioned as literal geographical fact but the compiler of the latter work whose object it was to appear and to make his forefathers appear as reasonable as learned chinese acids gloss to the effect that one account xxviii says that the even hill of hades is no distinct place but simply the moment when breathing ceases at the time of death —not happy guess certainly for this pass is mentioned in connection with izanagi return to the land of the living in short we may say of this work what was said of the septuagint —that itrationalizes perhaps it will be asked how can it have come to pass that book in which the national traditions are thus unmistakably tampered with and which is moreover written in chinese instead of in the native tongue has enjoyed such much greater share of popularity than the more genuine work the answer lies on the surface the concessions made to chinese notions went far towards satisfying minds trained on chinese models while at the same time the reader had his respect for the old native emperors increased and was enabled to preserve some sort of belief in the native gods people are rarely quite logical in such matters particularly in an early stage of society and difficulties are glossed over rather than insisted upon the beginning of the world for instance or to use japanese phraseology the separation of heaven and earth took place long time ago and perhaps although there could of course be no philosophical doubt as to the course of this event having been the interaction of the passive and active essences it might also somehow be true that izanagi and izanami the male who invites and the female who invites were the progenitor and progenitrix of japan who knows but what in them the formative principles may not have been embodied represented or figured forth after fashion not quite determined but none the less real as matter of fact the xxix two deities in question have often been spoken of in japanese books under such designations as the yindeity and the yangdeity and in his chinese preface the very compiler of these records lends his sanction to the use of such phraseology though if we look closely at the part taken by the gods in the legend narrated in sect iv it would seem but imperfectly applicable if again early sovereigns such as the empress jin gō address their troops in sentences cribbed from the shu ching or like the emperor kei kō describe the ainos in terms that would only suit the pages of chinese topographer —both these personages being supposed to have lived prior to the opening up of intercourse with the continent of asia —the anachronism was partly hidden by the fact of the work which thus recorded their doings being itself written in the chinese language where such phrases only sounded natural in some instances too the chinese usage had so completely superseded the native one as to cause the latter to have been almost forgotten excepting by the members of the shintō priesthood this happened in the case of the chinese method of divination by means of tortoise shell whose introduction caused the elder native custom of divination through the shoulder blade of deer to fall into desuetude whether indeed this native custom itself may not perhaps be traced back to still earlier continental influence is another question so far as any documentary information reaches divination through the shoulder blade of deer was the most ancient japanese method of ascertaining the will of the gods the use of the chinese sexagenary cycle for counting years months and days is another instance of the imported xxx usage having become so thoroughly incorporated with native habits of mind as to make the anachronism of employing it when speaking of period confessedly anterior to the introduction of continental civilization pass unnoticed as for the to modern european grotesque notion of pretending to give the precise months and days of events supposed to have occurred thousand years before the date assigned to the introduction of astronomical instruments of observatories and even of the art of writing that is another of those inconsistencies which while lying on the very surface yet so easily escape the uncritical oriental mind semi civilized people tire of asking questions and to question antiquity which fills so great place in their thoughts is the last thing that would occur to any of their learned men whose mental attitude is characteristically represented by confucius when he calls himself transmitter and not maker believing in and loving the ancients as regards the question of language standard chinese soon became easier to understand than archaic japanese as the former alone was taught in the schools and the native language changed rapidly during the century or two that followed the diffusion of the foreign tongue and civilization we xxxi have only to call to mind the relative facility to most of ourselves of latin book and of one written in early english of course as soon as the principles of the japaneserenaissancehad taken hold of men minds in the eighteenth century the more genuine more national work assumed its proper place in the estimation of students but the uncouthness of the style according to modern ideas and the greater amount of explanation of all sorts that is required in order to make the records of ancient matters intelligible must always prevent them from attaining to the popularity of the sister history thus though published almost simultaneously the tendencies of the two works were very different and their fate has differed accordingly to the european student the chief value of the chronicles of japan lies in the fact that their author in treating of the so called divine age often gives number of various forms of the same legend under the heading of one account says suffixed in the form of note to the main text no phrase is more commonly met with in later treatises on japanese history than this one account in the chronicles of japan says and it will be met with occasionally in the foot notes to the present translation there are likewise instances of the author of the chronicles having preserved either in the text or in one account traditions omitted by the compiler of the records such are for instance the quaint legend invented to explain the fact that the sun and moon do not shine simultaneously and the curious development of the legend of the expulsion of the deity xxxii paragraph continues susa no wo impetuous male telling us of the hospitality which was refused to him by the other gods when he appeared before them to beg for shelter many of the songs too in the chronicles are different from those in the records and make precious addition to our vocabulary of archaic japanese the prose text likewise contains in the shape of notes numbers of readings by which the pronunciation of words written ideographically or the meaning of words written phonetically in the records may be ascertained finally the chronicles give us the annals of seventy two years not comprised in the plan of the records by carrying down to the history which in the records stops at the year although therefore it is mistake xxxiii to assert as some have done that the chronicles of japan must be placed at the head of all the japanese historical works their assistance can in no wise be dispensed with by the student of japanese mythology and of the japanese language xxvii xxvii xxvii see sects xxi xxvii and xxiii xxvii rendered in the english translation by the male who invites xxvii yomo tsu hira saka xxix xxx details as to the adoption by the japanese of the chinese system of computing time will be found in the late mr bramsen japanese chronological tables where that lamented scholar brands the whole system of fictitious dates

motowori inquiry into the true chronology pp and his second work on the same subject entitled discussion of the objections to the inquiry into the true chronology pp et seq xxx confucian analects book vii chap dr legge translation xxxi it may perhaps be worth while to quote this legend in full it is as follows xxxii one account says that the heaven shining great deity being in heaven said hear that in the central land of reed plains japan there is food possessing deity do thou thine augustness moon night possessor go and see his augustness the moon night possessor having received these orders descended to earth and arrived at the place where the food possessing deity was the food possessing deity forthwith on turning her head towards the land produced rice from her mouth again on turning to the sea she also produced from her mouth things broad of fin and things narrow of fin again on turning to the mountains she also produced from her mouth things rough of hair and things soft of hair having collected together all these things she offered them to the moon god as feast on hundred tables at this time his augustness the moon night possessor being angry and colouring up said how filthy how vulgar what shalt thou dare to feed me with things spat out from thy mouth and with these words he drew his sabre and slew her afterwards he made his report to the sun goddess when he told her all the particulars the heaven shining great deity was very angry and said thou art wicked deity whom it is not right for me to see —and forthwith she and his augustness the moon night possessor dwelt separately day and night the partly parallel legend given in these records forms the subject of sect xvii of the translation xxxiii compare mr satow remarks on this subject in vol iii pt pp of these transactions next iv manners and customs of the early japanese the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com the japanese of the mythical period as pictured in the legends preserved by the compiler of the records of ancient matters were race who had long emerged from the savage state and had attained to high level of barbaric skill the stone age was forgotten by them—or nearly so —and the evidence points to their never having passed through genuine bronze age though the knowledge of bronze was at later period introduced from the neighbouring continent they used iron for manufacturing spears swords and knives of various shapes and likewise for the more peaceful purpose of making hooks wherewith to angle or to fasten the doors of their huts their other warlike and hunting implements besides traps and gins which appear to have been used equally for catching beasts and birds and for destroying human enemies were bows and elbow pads —the latter seemingly of skin while special allusion is made to the fact that the arrows were feathered perhaps clubs should be added to the list of the bows and arrows swords and knives there is perpetual mention but nowhere do we hear of the tools xxxiv with which they were manufactured and there is the same remarkable silence regarding such widely spread domestic implements as the saw and the axe we hear however of the pestle and fire drill of the wedge of the sickle and of the shuttle used in weaving navigation seems to have been in very elementary stage indeed the art of sailing was as we know from the classical literature of the country but little practised in japan even so late as the middle of the tenth century of our era subsequent to the general diffusion of chinese civilization though rowing and punting are often mentioned by the early poets in one passage of the records and in another of the chronicles mention is made of two forked boat used on inland pools or lakes but as rule in the earlier portions of those works we read only of people going to sea or being sent down from heaven in water proof baskets without oars and reaching their destination not through any efforts of their own but through supernatural inter position to what we should call towns or villages very little reference is made anywhere in the records or in that portion of the chronicles which contains the account of the so called divine age but from what xxxv we learn incidentally it would seem that the scanty population was chiefly distributed in small hamlets and isolated dwellings along the coast and up the course of the larger streams of house building there is frequent mention —especially of the building of palaces or temples for sovereigns or gods —the words palace and temple being it should be mentioned represented in japanese by the same term sometimes in describing the construction of such sacred dwelling the author of the records abandoning his usual fiat and monotonous style soars away on poetic wings as when for instance he tells how the monarch of idzumo on abdicating in favour of the sun goddess descendant covenanted that the latter should make stout his temple pillars on the nethermost rock bottom and make high the cross beams to the plain of high heaven it must not however be inferred from such language that these so called palaces and temples were of very gorgeous and imposing aspect the more exact notices to be culled from the ancient shintō rituals which are but little posterior to the records and in no wise contradict the inferences to be drawn from the latter having been already summarized by mr satow it may be as well to quote that gentleman words he says the palace of the japanese sovereign was wooden hut with its pillars planted in the ground instead of being erected upon broad fiat stories as in modern buildings the whole frame work consisting of posts beams rafters door posts and window frames was tied together with cords made by twisting the long fibrous stems of climbing plants such as pueraria xxxvi paragraph continues thunbergiana kuzu and wistaria sinensis fuji the floor must have been low down so that the occupants of the building as they squatted or lay on their mats were exposed to the stealthy attacks of venomous snakes which were probably far more numerous in the earliest ages when the country was for the most part uncultivated than at the present day there seems some reason to think that theyuka here translated floor was originally nothing but couch which ran round the sides of the hut the rest of the space being simply mud floor and that the size of the couch was gradually increased until it occupied the whole interior the rafters projected upward beyond the ridge pole crossing each other as is seen in the roofs of modem shin tau temples whether their architecture be in conformity with early traditions in which case all the rafters are so crossed or modified in accordance with more advanced principles of construction and the crossed rafters retained only as ornaments at the two ends of the ridge the roof was thatched and perhaps had gable at each end with hole to allow the smoke of the wood fire to escape so that it was possible for birds flying in and perching on the beams overhead to defile the food or the fire with which it was cooked to this description it need only be added that fences were in use and that the wooden doors sometimes fastened by means of hooks resembled those with which we are familiar in europe rather than the sliding screen like doors of modem japan the windows seem to have been mere holes rugs of skins and rush matting were occasionally brought in to sit upon and we even hear once or twice of silk rugs being used for the same purpose by the noble and wealthy xxxvii the habits of personal cleanliness which so pleasantly distinguish the modern japanese from their neighbours in continental asia though less fully developed than at present would seem to have existed in the germ in early times as we read more than once of bathing in rivers and are told of bathing women being specially attached to the person of certain imperial infant lustrations too formed part of the religious practices of the race latrines are mentioned several times they would appear to have been situated away from the houses and to have generally been placed over running stream whence doubtless the name for latrine in the archaic dialect kaha yai river house well known japanese classic of the tenth century the yamato tales tells us indeed that in older days the people dwelt in houses raised on platforms built out on the river ikuta and goes on to relate story which presupposes such method of architecture passage in the account of the reign of the emperor jim mu which occurs both in the records and in the chronicles and another in the reign of the emperor sui nin occurring in the records only might be interpreted so as to support this statement but both are extremely obscure and beyond the fact that people who habitually lived near the water may have built their houses after the aquatic fashion practised in different parts of the world by certain savage tribes both ancient and modem the present writer is not aware of any authority for the assertion that they actually xxxviii did so except the isolated passage in the yamato tales just quoted peculiar sort of dwelling place which the two old histories bring prominently under our notice is the so called parturition house —a one roomed hut without windows which woman was expected to build and retire into for the purpose of being delivered unseen it would also appear to be not unlikely that newly married couples retired into specially built hut for the purpose of consummating the marriage and it is certain that xxxix for each sovereign new palace was erected on his accession castles are not distinctly spoken of till period which though still mythical in the opinion of the present writer coincides according to the received chronology with the first century we then first meet with the curious term rice castle whose precise signification is matter of dispute among the native commentators but which on comparison with chinese descriptions of the early japanese should probably be understood to mean kind of palisade serving the purpose of redoubt behind which the warriors could ensconce themselves if this conjecture be correct we have here good instance of word so to speak moving upward with the march of civilization the term which formerly denoted something not much better than fence having later come to convey the idea of stone castle to conclude the subject of dwelling places it should be stated that cave dwellers are sometimes alluded to the legend of the retirement of the sun goddess into cavern may possibly suggest to some the idea of an early period when such habitations were the normal abodes of the ancestors of the japanese race but at the time when the national traditions assumed their present shape such state of things had certainly quite passed away if it ever existed and only barbarous ainos and rough bands of robbers are credited with the construction of such primitive retreats natural caves xl paragraph continues it may be well to state are rare in japan and the caves that are alluded to were mostly artificial as may be gathered from the context the food of the early japanese consisted of fish and of the flesh of the wild creatures which fell by the hunter arrow or were taken in the trapper snare —an animal diet with which buddhist prohibitions had not yet interfered as they began to do in early historical times rice is the only cereal of which there is such mention made as to place it beyond doubt that its cultivation dates back to time immemorial beans millet and barley are indeed named once together with silkworms in the account of the divine age but the passage has every aspect of an interpolation in the legend perhaps not dating back long before the time of the eighth century compiler few unimportant vegetables and fruits of most of which there is but single mention will be found in the list of plants given below the intoxicating liquor calledsakewas known in japan during the mythical period and so were chopsticks for eating the food with cooking pots and cups and dishes—the latter both of earthenware and of leaves of trees —are also mentioned but of the use of fire for warming purposes we hear nothing tables are named several times but never in connection with food they would seem to have been exclusively used for the purpose of presenting offerings on and were probably quite small and low —in fact rather trays than tables according to european ideas in the use of clothing and the specialization of garments xli the early japanese had reached high level we read in the most ancient legends of upper garments skirts trowsers girdles veils and hats while both sexes adorned themselves with necklaces bracelets and head ornaments of stones considered precious —in this respect offering striking contrast to their descendants in modern times of whose attire jewelry forms no part the material of their clothes was hempen cloth and paper mulberry bark coloured by being rubbed with madder and probably with woad and other tinctorial plants all the garments so far as we may judge were woven sewing being nowhere mentioned and it being expressly stated by the chinese commentator on the shan hai ching who wrote early in the fourth century that the japanese had no needles from the great place which the chase occupied in daily life we are led to suppose that skins also were used to make garments of there is in the records at least one passage which favours this supposition and the chronicles in one place mention the straw rain coat and broad brimmed hat which still form the japanese peasant effectual protection against the inclemencies of the weather the tendrils of creeping plants served the purposes of string and bound the warrior sword round his waist combs are mentioned and it is evident that much attention was devoted to the dressing of the hair the men seem to have bound up their hair in two bunches one on each side of the head whilst the young boys tied theirs into topknot the unmarried girls let their locks hang down over their necks and the xlii married women dressed theirs after fashion which apparently combined the two last named methods there is no mention in any of the old books of cutting the hair or beard except in token of disgrace neither do we gather that the sexes but for this matter of the headdress were distinguished by diversity of apparel and ornamentation with regard to the precious stones mentioned above as having been used as ornaments for the head neck and arms the texts themselves give us little or no information as to the identity of the stones meant to be referred to indeed it is plain and the native commentators admit the fact that variety of chinese characters properly denoting different sort of jewels were used indiscriminately by the early japanese writers to represent the single native wordtamawhich is the only one the language contains to denote any hard substance on which special value is set and which often refers chiefly to the rounded shape so that it might in fact be translated by the word bead as fittingly as by the word jewel we know however from the specimens which have rewarded the labours of archaeological research in japan that agate crystal glass jade serpentine and steatite are the most usual materials and carved and pierced cylindrical shapes maga tamaandkuda tama the commonest forms the horse which was ridden but not driven the xliii barn door fowl and the cormorant used for fishing are the only domesticated creatures mentioned in the earlier traditions with the doubtful exception of the silkworm to which reference has already been made in the later portions of the records and chronicles dogs and cattle are alluded to but sheep swine and even cats were apparently not yet introduced indeed sheep were scarcely to be seen in japan until few years ago goats are still almost unknown and swine and all poultry excepting the barn door fowl extremely uncommon the following enumeration of the animals and plants mentioned in the earlier

of all non scientific nomenclatures several species and occasionally even more than one genus are included in single japanese term thechi dori here always rendered dotterel is the name of any kind of sand piper plover or dotterel kariis general name applied to geese but not to all the species and also to the great bustard again it should not be forgotten that there may have been and probably were in the application of some of these terms differences of usage between the present day and eleven or twelve centuries ago absolute precision is therefore not attainable noticeable in the above lists is the abundant mention of plant names in work which is in no ways occupied with botany equally noticeable is the absence of some of those which are most common at the present day such as the tea plant and the plum tree while of the orange we are specially informed that it was introduced from abroad the difference between the various stones and metals seems on the other hand to have attracted very little attention from the early japanese in late xlviii times the chief metals were named mostly according to their colour as follows yellow metal gold white metal silver red metal copper black metal iron chinese or korean metal bronze but in the records the only metal of which it is implied that it was in use from time immemorial is iron while various treasures dazzling to the eye from gold and silver downwards are only referred to once as existing in the far western land of korea red clay is the sole kind of earth specially named black blue including green red piebald of horses white yellow is not mentioned except in the foreign chinese phrase the yellow stream signifying hades and not to be counted in this context neither are any of the numerous terms which in modem japanese serve to distinguish delicate shades of colour we hear of the blue or green black clouds and also of the blue or green sea but the blue sky is conspicuous by its absence here as in so many other early literatures though strangely enough it does occur in the oldest written monuments of the chinese with regard to the subject of names for the different degrees of relationship —a subject of sufficient interest xlix to the student of sociology to warrant its being discussed at some length —it may be stated that in modern japanese parlance the categories according to which relationship is conceived of do not materially differ from those that are current in europe thus we find father grandfather great grandfather uncle nephew stepfather stepson father in law and the corresponding terms for females —mother grandmother etc —as well as such vaguer designations as parents ancestors cousins and kinsmen the only striking difference is that brothers and sisters instead of being considered as all mutually related in the same manner are divided into two categories viz ani elder brother otouto younger brother ane elder sister imouto younger sister in exact accordance with chinese usage now in archaic times there seems to have been different and more complicated system somewhat resembling that which still obtains among the natives of korea and which the introduction of chinese ideas and especially the use of the chinese written characters must have caused to be afterwards abandoned there are indications of it in some of the phonetically written fragments of the records but they are not of themselves sufficient to furnish satisfactory explanation and the subject has puzzled the nativeliteratithemselves moreover the english language fails us at this point and elder and younger brother elder and younger sister are the only terms at the translator command it may therefore be as well to quotein extensomotowori elucidation of the archaic usage to be found in vol xiii of his exposition of the records of ancient matters he says anciently when brothers and sisters were spoken of the elder brother was calledseoraniin contradistinction to the younger brothers and younger sisters and the younger brother also was calledsein contradistinction to the elder sister the elder sister was calledanein contradistinction to the younger sister and the younger brother also would

brothers and sisters to use the wordsiro seforse iro neforane andiro doforoto and analogy forces us to conclude thatiro mowas used forimo motowori elsewhere explainsiroas term of endearment identical with the wordiro love but we may hesitate to accept this view it will be observed that the foundation of this system of nomenclature was subordination of the younger to the elder born modified by subordination of the females to the males in the east especially in primitive times it is not place aux dames but place aux messieurs another important point to notice is that though in few passages of the records we find distinction drawn between the chief and the secondary wives perhaps nothing more than the favorite or better born li and the less well born are meant to be thus designated —yet not only is this distinction not drawn throughout but the wife is constantly spoken of asimo younger sister it fact sister and wife were convertible terms and ideas and what in later stage of japanese as of western civilization is abhorred as incest was in archaic japanese times the common practice we also hear of marriages with half sisters with stepmothers and with aunts and to wed two or three sisters at the same time was recognized usage most such unions were naturally so contrary to chinese ethical ideas that one of the first traces of the influence of the latter in japan was the stigmatizing of them as incest and the conflict between the old native custom and the imported moral code is seen to have resulted in political troubles marriage with sisters was naturally the first to disappear and indeed it is only mentioned in the legends of the gods but unions with half sisters aunts etc lasted on into the historic epoch of exogamy such as obtains in china there is no trace in any japanese document nor do any other artificial impediments seem to have stood in the way of the free choice of the early japanese man who also in some cases at least received dowry with his bride or brides if taking as our guides the incidental notices which are scattered up and down the pages of the earlier portion of the records we endeavour to follow an archaic japanese through the chief events of his life lii from the cradle to the tomb it will be necessary to begin by recalling what has already been alluded to as the parturition house built by the mother and in which as we are specially told that it was made windowless it would perhaps be contradictory to say that the infant first saw the light soon after birth name was given to it —given to it by the mother —such name generally containing some appropriate personal reference in the most ancient times each person so far as we can judge bore but one name or rather one string of words compounded together into sort of personal designation but already at the dawn of the historical epoch we are met by the mention of surnames and of what in the absence of more fitting word the translator has ventured to call gentile names bestowed by the sovereign as recompense for some noteworthy deed it may be gathered from our text that the idea of calling in the services of wet nurses in exceptional case had already suggested itself to the minds of the ruling class whose infants were likewise sometimes attended by special bathing women to what we should call education whether mental or physical there is absolutely no reference made in the histories all that can be inferred is that when old enough to do so the boys began to follow one of the callings of hunter or fisherman liii while the girls staid at home weaving the garments of the family there was also great deal of fighting generally of treacherous kind in the intervals of which the warriors occupied themselves in cultivating patches of ground the very little which is to be gathered concerning the treatment of old people would seem to indicate that they were well cared for we are nowhere told of any wedding ceremonies except the giving of presents by the bride or her father the probable reason being that no such ceremonies existed indeed late on into the middle age cohabitation alone constituted matrimony —cohabitation often secret at first but afterwards acknowledged when instead of going round under cover of night to visit his mistress the young man brought her back publicly to his parents house mistress wife and concubine were thus terms which were not distinguished and the woman could naturally be discarded at any moment she indeed was expected to remain faithful to the man with whom she had had more than passing intimacy but no reciprocal obligation bound him to her thus the wife of one of the gods is made to address her husband in poem which says thou indeed being man probably hast on the various island headlands that thou seest and on every beach headland that thou lookest on wife like the young herbs but alas being woman have no spouse except thee etc etc in this sombre picture the only graceful touch is the custom which lovers or spouses had of tieing each other girdles when about to part for time —a ceremony by liv which they implied that they would be constant to each other during the period of absence what became of the children in cases of conjugal separation does not clearly appear in the only instance which is related at length we find the child left with the father but this instance is not normal one adoption is not mentioned in the earliest traditions so that when we meet with it later on we shall probably be justified in tracing its introduction to chinese sources of death bed scenes and dying speeches we hear but little and that little need not detain us the burial rites are more important the various ceremonies observed on such an occasion are indeed not explicitly detailed but we gather thus much that the hut tenanted by the deceased was abandoned —an ancient custom to whose former existence the removal of the capital at the commencement of each reign long continued to bear witness —and that the body was first deposited for some days in mourning house during which interval the survivors though their tears and lamentations are also mentioned held carousal feasting perhaps on the food which was specially prepared as an offering to the dead person afterwards the corpse was interred presumably in wooden bier as the introduction of stone tombs is specially noted by the historian as having taken place at the end of the reign of the emperor sui nin and was therefore believed by those who handed down the legendary history to have been comparatively recent innovation the date assigned to this monarch by the author of the chronicles coinciding lv with the latter part of our first and the first half of our second centuries to time not long anterior is attributed the abolition of custom previously observed at the interments of royal personages this custom was the burying alive of some of their retainers in the neighbourhood of the tomb we know also both from other early literary sources and from the finds which have recently rewarded the labours of archaeologists that articles of clothing ornaments etc were buried with the corpse it is all the more curious that the records should nowhere make any reference to such custom and is proof if any be needed of the necessity of not relying exclusively on any single authority however respectable if the full and true picture of japanese antiquity is to be restored few details as to the abolition of the custom of burying retainers alive round their master tomb and of the substitution for this cruel holocaust of images in clay will be found in sect lxiii note and in sect lxxv note of the following translation if the custom be one which is properly included under the heading of human sacrifices it is the only form of such sacrifices of which the earliest recorded japanese social state retained any trace the absence of slavery is another honourable feature on the other hand the most cruel punishments were dealt out to enemies and wrongdoers their nails were extracted the sinews of their knees were cut they were buried up to the neck so that their eyes burst etc death too was inflicted for the lvi most trivial offences of branding or rather tattooing the face as punishment there are one or two incidental mentions but as no tattooing or other marking or painting of the body for any other purpose is ever alluded to with the solitary exception in one passage of the painting of her eyebrows by woman it is possible that the penal use of tattooing may have been borrowed from the chinese to whom it was not unknown the shocking obscenity of word and act to which the records bear witness is another ugly feature which must not quite be passed over in silence it is true that decency as we understand it is very modern product and is not to be looked for in any society in the barbarous stage at the same time the whole range of literature might perhaps be ransacked in vain for parallel to the naïve filthiness of the passage forming sect iv of the following translation or to the extraordinary topic which the hero yamato take and his mistress miyazu are made to select as the theme of poetical repartee one passage likewise would lead us to suppose that the most beastly crimes were commonly committed to conclude this portion of the subject it may be useful for the sake of comparison to call attention to few arts and products with which the early japanese werenotacquainted thus they had no tea no fans no porcelain no lacquer —none of the things in fact by which in later times they have been chiefly known they did not yet use vehicles of any kind they had no accurate method of computing time no money scarcely any lvii knowledge of medicine neither though they possessed some sort of music and poems few of which at least are not without merit do we hear anything of the art of drawing but the most important art of which they were ignorant is that of writing as some misapprehension has existed on this head and scholars in europe have been misled by the inventions of zealous champions of the shintō religion into belief in the so called divine characters by them alleged to have been invented by the japanese gods and to have been used by the japanese people prior to the introduction of the chinese ideographic writing it must be stated precisely that all the traditions of the divine age and of the reigns of the earlier emperors down to the third century of our era according to the received chronology maintain complete silence on the subject of writing materials and records of every kind books are nowhere mentioned till period confessedly posterior to the opening up of intercourse with the asiatic continent and the first books whose names occur are the lun yü and the ch ien tzŭ wên which are said to have been brought over to japan during the reign of the emperor jin —according to the same chronology in the year after christ that even lviii this statement is antedated is shown by the fact that the ch ien tzŭ wên was not written till more than two centuries later —a fact which is worthy the attention of those who have been disposed simply to take on trust the assertions of the japanese historians it should likewise be mentioned that as has already been pointed out by mr aston the japanese termsfumi written document andfude pen are probably corruptions of foreign words the present indeed is not the place to discuss the whole question of the so called divine characters which motowori the most patriotic as well as the most learned of the japanese literati dismisses in note to the prolegomena of his exposition of the records of ancient matters with the remark that they are late forgery over which no words need be wasted but as this mare nest has been imported into the discussion of the early japanese social state and as the point is one on which the absolute silence of the early traditions bears such clear testimony it was impossible to pass it by without some brief allusion xxxiv curious scrap of the history of japanese civilization is preserved in the wordkaji whose exclusive acceptation in the modern tongue is rudder in archaic japanese it meant oar signification which is now expressed by the termro which has been borrowed from the chinese it is matter of debate whether the ancient japanese boats possessed such an appliance as arudder and the wordtagishioriaishihas been credited with that meaning the more likely opinion seems to be that both the thing and the word were specialized in later times the early japanese

mothers were formerly driven out to the huts on the mountain side and according to the accounts of native writers left to shift for themselves the result not unfrequently being the death of the newborn infant or if it survived the rude circumstances under which it first saw the light the seeds of disease were sown which clung to it throughout its after life the rule of non intercourse was so strictly enforced that the woman was not allowed to leave the hut even to visit her own parents at the point of death and besides the injurious effects that this solitary confinement must have had on the wives themselves their prolonged absence was serious loss to households where there were elder children and large establishments to be superintended the rigour of the custom was so far relaxed in modern times that the huts were no longer built on the hills but were constructed inside the homestead it was subject of wonder to people from other parts of japan that the senseless practice should still be kept up and its abolition was often recommended but the administration of the shoguns was not animated by reforming spirit and it remained for the government of the mikado to exhort the islanders to abandon this and the previously mentioned custom they are therefore no longer sanctioned by official authority and the force of social opinion against them is increasing so that before

japanese word for pen next religious and political ideas of the early japanese beginnings of the japanese nation and credibility of the national records the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com lix the religious beliefs of the modern upholders of shintō may be ascertained without much difficulty by perusal of the works of the leaders of the movement which has endeavoured during the last century and half to destroy the influence of buddhism and of the chinese philosophy and which has latterly succeeded to some extent in supplanting those two foreign systems but in japan as elsewhere it has been impossible for men really to turn back thousand years in religious thought and act and when we try to discover the primitive opinions that were entertained by the japanese people prior to the introduction of the chinese culture we are met by difficulties that at first seem insuperable the documents are scanty and the modern commentaries untrustworthy for they are all written under the influence of preconceived opinion moreover the problem is apparently complicated by mixture of races and mythologies and by filtering in of chinese ideas previous to the compilation of documents of any sort though these are considerations which have hitherto scarcely been taken into account by foreigners and are designedly neglected and obscured by such narrowly patriotic native writers as motowori and hirata lx in the political field the difficulties are not less but rather greater for when once the imperial house and the centralized japanese polity as we know it from the sixth or seventh century of our era downwards became fully established it was but too clearly in the interest of the powers that be to efface as far as possible the trace of different government arrangements which may have preceded them and to cause it to be believed that as things were then so had they always been the emperor tem mu with his anxiety to amend the deviations from truth and the empty falsehoods of the historical documents preserved by the various families and the author of the chronicles of japan with his elaborate system of fictitious dates recur to our minds and we ask ourselves to what extent similar garblings of history —sometimes unintentional —may have gone on during earlier ages when there was even less to check them than there was in the eighth century if therefore the translator here gives expression to few opinions founded chiefly on careful study of the text of the records of ancient matters helped out by study of the chronicles of japan he would be understood to do so with great diffidence especially with regard to his few so to speak constructive remarks as to the destructive side of the criticism there need be less hesitation for the old histories bear evidence too conclusively against themselves for it to be possible for the earlier portions of them at least to stand the test of sober investigation before endeavouring to piece together the little that is found in the records to illustrate the beliefs of archaic japanese times it will be necessary at the risk of dullness to give summary of the old traditions as they lie before us in lxi their entirety after which will be hazarded few speculations on the subject of the earlier tribes which combined to form the japanese people for the four questions of religious beliefs of political arrangements of race and of the credibility of documents all hang closely together and properly speaking form but one highly complex problem greatly condensed the early japanese traditions amount to this after an indefinitely long period during which were born number of abstract deities who are differently enumerated in the records and in the chronicles two of these deities brother and sister named izanagi and izanami the male who invites and the female who invites are united in marriage and give birth to the various islands of the japanese archipelago when they have finished producing islands they proceed to the production of large number of gods and goddesses many of whom correspond to what we should call personifications of the powers of nature though personification is word which in its legitimate acceptations is foreign to the japanese mind the birth of the fire god causes izanami death and the most striking episode of the whole mythology then ensues when her husband orpheus like visits her in the under world to implore her to return to him she would willingly do so and bids him wait while she consults with the deities of the place but he impatient at her long tarrying breaks off one of the end teeth of the comb stuck in the left bunch of his hair lights it and goes in only to find her hideous mass of corruption in whose midst are seated the eight gods of thunder this episode ends with the deification of lxii paragraph continues three peaches who had assisted him in his retreat before the armies of the under world and with bitter words exchanged between him and his wife who herself pursues him as far as the even pass of hades returning to himuka in south western japan izanagi purifies himself by bathing in stream and as he does so fresh deities are born from each article of clothing that he throws down on the river bank and from each part of his person one of these deities was the sun goddess who was born from his left eye while the moon god sprang from his right eye and the last born of all susa no wo whose name the translator renders by the impetuous male was born from his nose between these three children their father divides the inheritance of the universe at this point the story loses its unity the moon god is no more heard of and the traditions concerning the sun goddess and those concerning the impetuous male deity diverge in manner which is productive of inconsistencies in the remainder of the mythology the sun goddess and the impetuous male deity have violent quarrel and at last the latter breaks hole in the roof of the hall in heaven where his sister is sitting at work with the celestial weaving maidens and through it lets fall heavenly piebald horse which he had flayed with backward flaying the consequences of this act were so disastrous that the sun goddess withdrew for season into cave from which the rest of the eight hundred myriad according to the chronicles eighty lxiii myriad deities with difficulty allured her the impetuous male deity was thereupon banished and the sun goddess remained mistress of the field yet strange to say she thenceforward retires into the background and the most bulky section of the mythology consists of stories concerning the impetuous male deity and his descendants who are represented as the monarchs of japan or rather of the province of idzumo the impetuous male deity himself whom his father had charged with the dominion of the sea never assumes that rule but first has curiously told amorous adventure and an encounter with an eight forked serpent in idzumo and afterwards reappears as the capricious and filthy deity of hades who however seems to retain some power over the land of the living as he invests his descendant of the sixth generation with the sovereignty of japan of this latter personage whole cycle of stories is told all centering in idzumo we learn of his conversations with hare and with mouse of the prowess and cleverness which he displayed on the occasion of visit to his ancestor in hades which is in this cycle of traditions much less mysterious place than the hades visited by izanagi of his amours of his triumph over his eighty brethren of his reconciliation with his jealous empress and of his numerous descendants many of whom have names that are particularly difficult of comprehension we hear too in tradition which ends in pointless manner of microscopic deity who comes across the sea to ask this monarch of idzumo to share the sovereignty with him this last mentioned legend repeats itself in the sequel the sun goddess who on her second appearance is constantly xliv represented as acting in concert with the high august producing wondrous deity —one of the abstractions mentioned at the commencement of the records —resolves to bestow the sovereignty of japan on child of whom it is doubtful whether he were hers or that of her brother the impetuous male deity three embassies are sent from heaven to idzumo to arrange matters but it is only fourth that is successful the final ambassadors obtaining the submission of the monarch or deity of idzumo who surrenders his sovereignty and promises to serve the new dynasty apparently in the under world if palace or temple be built for him and he be appropriately worshipped thereupon the child of the deity whom the sun goddess had originally wished to make sovereign of japan descends to earth —not to idzumo in the north west be it mentioned as the logical sequence of the story would lead one to expect —but to the peak of mountain in the south western island of kiushiu here follows quaint tale accounting for the old appearance of the bèche le mer and another to account for the shortness of the lives of mortals after which we are told of the birth under peculiar circumstances of the heaven descended deity three sons two of these ho deri and howori whose names may be englished as fire shine and fire subside are the heroes of very curious legend which includes an elaborate account of visit paid by the latter to the palace of the god of ocean and of curse or spell which gained for him the victory over his elder brother and enabled him to dwell peacefully in his palace at takachiho for the space of five hundred and eighty years —the first statement lxv resembling date which the records contain this personage son married his own aunt and was the father of four children one of whom treading on the crest of the waves crossed over to the eternal land while second went into the sea plain and the two others moved eastward fighting with the chiefs of kibi and yamato having adventures with gods both with and without tails being assisted by miraculous sword and gigantic crow and naming the various places they passed through after incidents in their own career as the impetuous male and other divine personages had done before them one of these brothers was kamu yamato ihare biko who the other having died before him was first given the title of jim mu ten no more than fourteen centuries after the date which in the chronicles is assigned as that of his decease henceforth yamato which had scarcely been mentioned before and the provinces adjacent to it become the centre of the story and idzumo again emerges into importance very indecent love tale forms bridge which unites the two fragments of the mythology and the great deity of miwa who is identified with the deposed monarch of idzumo appears on the scene indeed during the rest of the story this great deity of miwa and his colleague the small august deity sukuna mi kami the deity izasa wake the three water gods of sumi and the great deity of kadzuraki of whom there is so striking mention in sect clviii form with the sun goddess and with certain divine sword lxvi preserved at the temple of isonokami in yamato the only objects of worship specially named the other gods and goddesses being no more heard of this portion of the story is closed by an account of the troubles which inaugurated the reign of jim mu successor sui sei and then occurs blank of according to the accepted chronology five hundred years during which absolutely nothing is told us excepting dreary genealogies the place where each sovereign dwelt and where he was buried and the age to which he lived —this after the minute details which had previously been given concerning the successive gods or monarchs down to sui sei inclusive it should likewise be noted that the average age of the first seventeen monarchs counting jim mu ten nō as the first according to received ideas is nearly years if we follow the records and over hundred if we follow the accepted chronology which is based chiefly on the constantly divergent statements contained in the chronicles the age of several of the monarchs exceeds years the above mentioned lapse of an almost blank period of five centuries brings us to the reign of the emperor known to history by the name of sū jin whose life of one hundred and sixty eight years one hundred and twenty according to the chronicles is supposed to have immediately preceded the christian era in this reign the former monarch of idzumo or god of miwa again appears and produces pestilence of the manner of staying which sū jin is warned in dream while curious but highly indecent episode tells us how person called oho taka ne ko was known to be son of the lxvii deity in question and was therefore appointed high priest of his temple in the ensuing reign an elaborate legend involving variety of circumstances as miraculous as any in the earlier portion of the mythology again centres in the necessity of pacifying the great god of idzumo and this with details of internecine strife in the imperial family of the sovereign amours and of the importation of the orange from the eternal land brings us to the cycle of traditions of which yamato take son of the emperor kei kō is the hero this prince after slaying one of his brothers in the privy accomplishes the task of subduing both western and eastern japan and notwithstanding certain details which are unsavoury to the european taste his story taken as whole is one of the most striking in the book he performs marvels of valour disguises himself as woman to slay the brigands is the possessor of magic sword and fire striker has devoted wife who stills the fury of the waves by sitting down upon their surface has encounters with deer and with boar who are really gods in disguise and finally dies on his way westward before he can reach his home in yamato his death is followed by highly mythological account of the laying to rest of the white bird into which he ended by being transformed the succeeding reign is blank and the next after that transports us without word of warning to quite another scene the sovereign home is now in tsukushi the south western island of the japanese archipelago and four of the gods through the medium of the sovereign wife who is known to history as the empress jin gō reveal the existence of the land of korea of lxviii which however this is not the first mention the emperor disbelieves the divine message and is punished by death for his incredulity but the empress after special consultation between her prime minister and the gods and the performance of various religious ceremonies marshals her fleet and with the assistance of the fishes both great and small and of miraculous wave reaches shirai one of the ancient divisions of korea and subdues it she then returns to japan the legend ending with curiously naive tale of how she sat fishing one day on shoal in the river wo gawa in tsukushi with threads picked out of her skirt for lines the next section shows her going up by sea to yamato —another joint in the story by means of which the yamato cycle of legends and the tsukushi cycle are brought into apparent unity the chronicles of japan have even improved upon this by making jingō husbands dwell in yamato at the commencement of his reign and only remove to tsukushi later so that if the less elaborated records had not been preserved the two threads of the tradition would have been still more difficult to unravel the empress army defeats the troops raised by the native kings or princes who are represented as her step sons and from that time forward the story runs on in single channel and always centres in yamato china likewise is now first mentioned books are said to have been brought over from the mainland and we hear of the gradual introduction of various useful arts even the annals of the reign of jin however during which this civilizing impulse from abroad is said to have commenced are not free from lxix details as miraculous as any in the earlier portions of the book indeed sects cxiv cxvi of the following translation which form part of the narrative of his reign are occupied with the recital of one of the most fanciful tales of the whole mythology the monarch himself is said to have lived hundred and thirty years while his successor lived eighty three according to the chronicles jin lived hundred and ten and his successor nin toku reigned eighty seven years it is not till the next reign that the miraculous ceases fact which significantly coincides with the reign in which according to statement in the chronicles historiographers were first appointed to all the provinces to record words and events and forward archives from all directions this brings us to the commencement of the fifth century of our era just three centuries before the compilation of our histories but only two centuries before the compilation of the first history of which mention has been preserved from that time the story in the records though not well told gives us some very curious pictures and reads as if it were reliable it is tolerably full for few reigns after which it again dwindles into mere genealogies carrying us down to the commencement of the seventh century the chronicles on the contrary give us full details down to that is to within nineteen years of the date of their compilation the reader who has followed this summary or who will take the trouble to read through the whole text for himself will perceive that there is no break in the story —at least no chronological break —and no break between the fabulous and the real unless indeed it be at the commencement of the fifth century of our era more lxx than thousand years later than the date usually accepted as the commencement of genuine japanese history the only breaks are —not chronological —but topographical this fact of the continuity of the japanese mythology and history has been fully recognized by the leading native commentators whose opinions are those considered orthodox by modern shintoists and they draw from it the conclusion that everything in the standard national histories must be equally accepted as literal truth all persons however cannot force their minds into the limits of such belief and early in the last century celebrated writer and thinker arawi hakuseki published work in which while accepting the native mythology as an authentic chronicle of events he did so with the reservation of proving to his own satisfaction that all the miraculous portions thereof were allegories and the gods only men under another name in this particular the elasticity of the japanese word for deity kami which has already been noticed stood the eastern euhemerus in good stead some of his explanations are however extremely comical and it is evident that such system enables the person who uses it to prove whatever he has mind to in the present century diluted form of the same theory was adopted by tachibana no moribe who although endeavouring to remain an orthodox shintoist yet decided that some of the so to speak uselessly lxxi miraculous incidents need not be believed in as revealed truth such for instance are the story of the speaking mouse and that of izanagi head dress turning into bunch of grapes he accounts for many of these details by the supposition that they are what he callswosana goto child like words and thinks that they were invented for the sake of fixing the story in the minds of children and are not binding on modern adults as articles of faith he is also willing to allow that some passages show traces of chinese influence and he blames motowori uncompromising championship of every iota of the existing text of the records of ancient matters as belonging to this same school of what may perhaps be termed rationalistic believers in japanese mythology contemporary christian writer mr takahashi gorō must also be mentioned treading in the foot steps of arawi hakuseki but bringing to bear on the legends of his own country some knowledge of the mythology of other lands he for instance explains the traditions of the sun goddess and of the eight forked serpent of yamada by postulating the existence of an ancient queen called sun whose brother after having been banished from her realm for his improper behaviour killed an enemy whose name was serpent etc while such statements as that the microscopic deity who came over the waves to share the sovereignty of idzumo would not tell his name are explained by the assertion that being foreigner he was unintelligible for some time until he had learnt the language it is certainly strange that such theorists should not see that they are undermining with one hand that which they endeavour to prop up with the other and that their own individual fancy is made by them the lxxii sole standard of historic truth yet mr takahashi confidently asserts that his explanations have nothing forced or fanciful in them and that they cannot fail to solve the doubts even of the greatest of doubters the general habit of the more sceptical japanese of the present day —i of ninety nine out of every hundred of the educated —seems to be to reject or at least to ignore the history of the gods whileimplicitlyaccepting the history of the emperors from jim mu downwards and in so doing they have been followed with but little reserve by most europeans almanacs histories and cyclopædias all continuing to repeat on the antiquated authority of such writers as kaempfer and titsingh that japan possesses an authentic history covering more that two thousand years while siebold and hoffmann even go the length of discussing thehourof jim mu accession in the year this is the attitude of mind now sanctioned by the governing class thus in the historical compilations used at text books in the schools the stories of the gods —that is to say the japanese traditions down to jim mu exclusive —are either passed over in silence or dismissed in few sentences while the annals of the human sovereigns —that is to say the japanese traditions from jim mu inclusive —are treated precisely as if the events therein related had happened yesterday and were as incontrovertibly historical as later statements for which there is contemporary evidence the same plan is pursued elsewhere in official publications thus to take out one example among many the imperial commissioners to the vienna exhibition in their lxxiii paragraph continues notice sur l’empire du japan tell us that l’histoire de la dynastie impériale remonte très haut l’obscurité entoure ses débuts vu l’absence de documents réguliers ou d’un calendrier parfait le premier empereur de la dynastie présente dont il reste des annales dignes de confiance est jin mou ten nō qui organisa un soulèvement dans la province de hiuga marcha l’est avec ses compagnons fonda sa capitale dans la vallée de kashihara dans le yamato et monta sur le trône comme empereur c’est de cet empereur que descend par une succession régulière la présente famille régnante du japon est de l’année de l’avènement de jin mou ten nō que date l’ère japonaise année avant jésus christ as for theère japonaisementioned by the commissioners it may be permitted to observe that it was only introduced by an edict dated th dec that is to say just fortnight before the publication of their report and this era this accession is confidently placed thirteen or fourteen centuries before the first history which records it was written nine centuries before at the earliest computation the art of writing was introduced into the country and on the sole authority of books teeming with miraculous legends does such proceeding need any comment after once being formulated in precise terms and can any unprejudiced person continue to accept the early japanese chronology and the first thousand years of the so called history of japan leaving this discussion let us now see whether lxxiv paragraph continues any information relative to the early religious and political state of the japanese can be gleaned from the pages of the records and of the chronicles there are fragments of information —fragments of two sorts —some namely of clear import others which are rather matter for inference and for argument let us take the positive fragments first—the notice as to cosmological ideas dreams prayers etc the first thing that strikes the student is that what for want of more appropriate name we must call the religion of the early japanese was not an organized religion we can discover in it nothing corresponding to the body of dogma the code of morals and the sacred book authoritatively enforcing both with which we are familiar in civilized religions such as buddhism christianity and islam what we find is bundle is miscellaneous superstitions rather than co ordinated system dreams evidently were credited with great importance the future being supposed to be foretold in them and the will of the gods made known sometimes even an actual object such as wonderful sword was sent down in dream thus to our ideas mixing the material with the spiritual the subject did not however present itself in that light to the early japanese to whom there was evidently but one order of phenomena —what we should call the natural order heaven or rather the sky was an actual place —not more ethereal than earth nor thought of as the abode of the blessed after death —but simply high plain situated above japan and communicating with japan by bridge or ladder and forming the residence of some of those powerful personages calledkami —a word which we must make shift to translate by god lxxv or goddess or deity an arrow shot from earth could reach heaven and make hole in it there was at least one mountain in heaven and one river with broad stony bed like those with which the traveller in japan becomes familiar one or two caves one or more wells and animals and trees there is however some confusion as to the mountain —the celebrated mount kagu —for there is one of that name in the province of yamato some of the gods dwelt here on earth or descended hither from heaven and had children by human women such for instance was the emperor jim mu great grandfather some few gods had tails or were otherwise personally remarkable and savage deities are often mentioned as inhabiting certain portions of japan both in the so called divine age and during the reigns of the human emperors down to time corresponding according to the generally received chronology with the first or second century of the christian era the human emperors themselves moreover were sometimes spoken of as deities and even made personal use of that designation the gods occasionally transformed themselves into animals and at other times simple tangible objects were called gods —or at least they were calledkami for the gulf separating the japanese from the english term can never be too often recalled to mind the wordkami as previously mentioned properly signifies superior and it would be putting more into it than it really implies to say that the early japanese deified —in our sense of the verb to deify —the peaches which izanagi used to pelt his assailants with or any other natural objects whatsoever it would indeed be to attribute to them lxxvi flight of imagination of which they were not capable and habit of personification not in accordance with the genius of their language some of the gods are mentioned collectively as bad deities like unto the flies in the fifth moon but there is nothing approaching systematic division into good spirits and bad spirits in fact the word spirit itself is not applicable at all to the gods of archaic japan they were like the gods of greece conceived of only as more powerful human beings they were born and some of them died though here again there is inconsistency as the death of some of them is mentioned in manner leading one to suppose that they were conceived of as being then at an end whereas in other cases such death seems simply to denote transference to hades or to what is called the one road which is believed to be synonym for hades sometimes again journey to hades is undertaken by god without any reference to his death nothing indeed could be less consistent than the various details hades itself is another instance of this inconsistency in the legend of oho kuni nushi the master of the great land —one of the idzumo cycle of legends —hades is described exactly as if it were part of the land of the living or exactly as if it were heaven which indeed comes to the same thing it has its trees its houses its family quarrels etc etc in the legend of izanagi on the other hand hades means simply the abode of horrible putrefaction and of the vindictive dead and is fitly described by the god himself who had ventured thither as hideous and polluted land the lxxvii only point in which the legends agree is in placing between the upper earth and hades barrier called the even pass or hill of hades the state of the dead in general is nowhere alluded to nor are the dying ever made to refer to future world whether good or evil the objects of worship were of course the gods or some of them it has already been stated that during the later portions of the story whose scene is laid almost exclusively on earth the sun goddess the deity izasa wake the divine sword of isonokami the small august deity sukuna mi kami the great gods of miwa and of kadzuraki and the three water deities of sumi alone are mentioned as having been specially worshipped of these the first and the last appear together forming sort of quaternion while the other five appear singly and have no connection with each other the deities of the mountains the deities of the rivers the deities of the sea etc are also mentioned in the aggregate as are likewise the heavenly deities and the earthly deities and the empress jin gō is represented as conciliating them all previous to her departure for korea by putting into gourd the ashes of amakitree and likewise making quantity of chopsticks and also of leaf platters and scattering them all on the waves this brings us to the subject of religious rites —a subject on which we long for fuller information than the texts afford that the conciliatory offerings made to the gods were of miscellaneous nature will be expected from the quotation just made nevertheless very lxxviii natural method was in the main followed for the people offered the things by which they themselves set most store as we bear at late period of the poet tsurayuki when in storm at sea flinging his mirror into the waves because he had but one the early japanese made offerings of two kinds of cloth one being hempen cloth and the other cloth manufactured from the bark of the paper mulberry offerings very precious in their eyes but which have in modern times been allowed to degenerate into useless strips of paper they likewise offered shields spears and other things food was offered both to the gods and to the dead indeed the palace or tomb of the dead monarch and the temple of the god cannot always be distinguished from each other and as has already been mentioned the japanese use the same wordmiyafor palace and for temple etymologically signifying august house it is naturally susceptible of what are to us two distinct meanings with but one exception the records do not give us the words of any prayers or as the japanese termnoritohas elsewhere been translated rituals conversations with the gods are indeed detailed but no devotional utterances fortunately however number of very ancient prayers have been preserved in other books and translations of some of them by mr satow will be found scattered through the volumes of the transactions of this society they consist mostly of declarations of praise and statements of offerings made either in return for favours received or conditionally on favours being granted they are all in prose and hymns do not seem to have been in use indeed of the hundred and eleven lxxix paragraph continues songs preserved in the records not one has any religious reference the sacred rite of which most frequent mention is made is purification by water trial by hot water is also alluded to in both histories but not till time confessedly posterior to the commencement of intercourse with the mainland we likewise hear of compacts occasionally entered into with god and somewhat resembling our european wager oath or curse priests are spoken of in few passages but without any details we do not hear of their functions being in any way mediatorial and the impression conveyed is that they did not exist in very early times as separate class when they did come into existence the profession soon became hereditary according to the general tendency in japan towards the hereditability of offices and occupations miscellaneous superstitions crop up in many places some of these were evidently obsolescent or unintelligible at the time when the legends crystallized into their present shape and stories are told purporting to give their origin thus we learn either in the records or in the chronicles or in both works why it is unlucky to use only one light to break off the teeth of comb at night time and to enter the house with straw hat and rain coat on the word wide dread of going against the sun is connected with the jim mu legend and recurs elsewhere we also hear of charms —for instance of lxxx the wondrous herb quelling sabre found by susa no wo the impetuous male deity inside serpent tail and still preserved as one of the imperialregalia other such charms were the tide flowing jewel and tide ebbing jewel that obtained for jim mu grandfather the victory over his elder brother together with the fishhook which figures so largely in the same legend divination by means of the shoulder blade of stag was favourite means of ascertaining the will of the gods sometimes also human beings seem to have been credited in vague manner with the power of prophetic utterance earthenware pots were buried at the point of his departure by an intending traveller in fight the initial arrow was regarded with superstitious awe the great precautions with which the empress jin gō is said to have set out on her expedition to korea have already been alluded to and indeed the commencement of any action or enterprise seems to have had special importance attributed to it to conclude this survey of the religious beliefs of the early japanese by referring as was clone in the case of the arts of life to certain notable features which are conspicuous by their absence attention may be called to the fact that there is no tradition of deluge no testimony to any effect produced on the imagination by the earthquakes from which the japanese islanders suffer such constant alarms no trace of star worship no notion lxxxi of incarnation or of transmigration this last remark goes to show that the japanese mythology had assumed its present shape before the first echo of buddhism reverberated on these shores but the absence of any tradition of deluge or inundation is still more remarkable both because such catastrophes are likely to occur occasionally in all lands and because the imagination of most nations seems to have been greatly impressed by their occurrence moreover what is specifically known to us asthedeluge has been lately claimed as an ancient altaïc myth yet here we have the oldest of theundoubtedlyaltaïc nations without any legend of the kind as for the neglect of the stars round whose names the imagination of other races has twined such fanciful conceits it is as characteristic of modern as of archaic japan the chinese designations of the constellations and some few chinese legends relating to them have been borrowed in historic times but no japanese writer has ever thought of looking in the stars for the poetry of heaven another detail worthy of mention is that the number seven which in so many countries has been considered sacred is here not prominent in any way its place being taken by eight thus we have eight great islands an eight forked serpent beard eighty hand breadths long god named eight thousand spears eighty or eight hundred myriads of deities etc etc the commentators think it necessary to tell us that all these eights and eighties need not be taken literally as they simply mean great number the fact remains that the number eight had for some unknown reason special significance attached to it and as the documents which mention eight also mention lxxxii nine and ten besides higher numbers and as in some test cases such as that of the eight great islands each of the eight is separately enumerated it is plain that when the early japanese said eight they meant eight though they may doubtless have used that number in vague manner as we do dozen hundred and thousand how glaringly different all this is from the fanciful accounts of shintō that have been given by some recent popular writers calls for no comment thus one of them whom another quotes as an authority tells us that shintō consists in the belief that the productive ethereal spirit being expanded through the whole universe every part is in some degree impregnated with it and therefore every part is in some measure the seat of the deity whence local gods and goddesses are everywhere worshipped and consequently multiplied without end like the ancient romans and the greeks they acknowledge supreme being the first the supreme the intellectual by which men have been reclaimed from rudeness and barbarism to elegance and refinement and been taught through privileged men and women not only to live with more comfort but to die with better hopes truly when one peruses such utterly groundless assertions —for that here quoted is but one among many one is tempted to believe that the nineteenth century must form part of the early mythopœic age with regard to the question of government we learn little beyond such vague statements as that to so and so was yielded by his eighty brethren the sovereignty of the land of idzumo or that izanagi divided the dominion lxxiii over all things between his three children bestowing on one the plain of high heaven on another the dominion of the night and on the third the sea plain but we do not in the earlier legends see such sovereignty actually administered the heavenly gods seem rather to have been conceived as forming sort of commonwealth who decided things by meeting together in counsel in the stony bed of the river of heaven and taking the advice of the shrewdest of their number indeed the various divine assemblies to which the story in the records and chronicles introduces us remind us of nothing so much as of the village assemblies of primitive tribes in many parts of the world where the cleverness of one and the general willingness to follow his suggestions fill the place of the more definite organization of later times descending from heaven to earth we find little during the so called divine age but stories of isolated individuals and families and it is not till the narrative of the wars of the earlier emperors commences that any kind of political organization comes into view then at once we hear of chieftains in every locality who lead their men to battle and are seemingly the sole depositories of power each in his microscopic sphere the legend of jim mu itself however is sufficient to show that autocracy as we understand it was not characteristic of the government of the tsukushi tribes for jim mu and his brother until the latter death are represented as joint chieftains of their host similarly we find that the territorial owners of yamato and the rulers of idzumo whom jim mu or his successors are said to have subjugated are constantly spoken of in the plural lxxxiv as if to intimate that they exerted divided sovereignty during the whole of the so called human age we meet both in parts of the country which were already subject to the imperial rule and in others which were not yet annexed with local magnates bearing these same titles of territorial owners rulers chiefs etc and the impression left on the mind is that in early historical times the sovereign power was not exercised directly over all parts of japan but that in many cases the local chieftains continued to hold sway though owning some sort of allegiance to the emperor in yamato while in others the emperor was strong enough to depose these local rulers and to put in their place his own kindred or retainers who however exercised unlimited authority in their own districts and used the same titles as had been borne by the former native rulers —that in fact the government was feudal rather than centralized this characteristic of the political organization of early japan has not altogether escaped the attention of the native commentators indeed the great shintō scholar hirata not only recognizes the fact but endeavours to prove that the system of centralization which obtained during the eighth ninth tenth eleventh and part of the twelfth centuries and which has been revived in our own day is nothing but an imitation of the chinese bureaucratic system and he asserts that an organized feudalism similar to that which existed from the twelfth century down to the year was the sole really ancient and national japanese form of government the translator cannot follow hirata to such lengths as he sees no evidence in the early histories of the intricate organization of mediaeval japan but that beyond the immediate lxxxv limits of the imperial domain the governmentresembledfeudalism rather than centralization seems indisputable it is also true that the seventh century witnessed sudden move in the direction of bureaucratic organization many of the titles which had up till that time denoted actual provincial chieftains being then either suppressed or else allowed to sink into mere gentile names another remark which is suggested by careful perusal of the two ancient histories is that the imperial succession was in early historical times very irregular strange gaps occur as late as the sixth century of our era and even when it was one of the children who inherited his father throne that child was rarely the eldest son what now are we to gather from its analysis of the religious and political features revealed to us by study of the books containing the early japanese traditions as to the still remoter history and tribal divisions of japan and as to the origin of the japanese legends very little that is certain perhaps but in the opinion of the present writer two or three interesting probabilities in view of the multiplicity of gods and the complications of the so called historical traditions he thinks that it would bea prioridifficult to believe that the development of japanese civilization should have run on in single stream broken only in the third century by the commencement of intercourse with the mainland of asia we are however not left to such merely theoretical consideration there are clear indications of there having been three centres of legendary cycles three streams which mixed together to form the japan which meets us lxxxvi at the dawn of authentic history in the fifth century of our era one of these centres —the most important in the mythology —is idzumo the second is yamato the third is tsukushi called in modern times kiushiu eastern and northern japan count for nothing indeed much of the north east and north was down to comparatively recent times occupied by the barbarous ainos or as they are called by the japanese yemishi yebisu or yezo that the legends or traditions derived from the three parts of the country here mentioned accord but imperfectly together is an opinion which has already been alluded to and upon which light may perhaps be thrown by more thorough shifting of the myths and beliefs classified according to this three fold system the question of the ancient division of japan into several independent states is however not completely matter of opinion for we have in the shan hai ching positive statement concerning northern and southern yamato and the chinese annals of both the han dynasties tell us of the division of the country into much larger number of kingdoms of which according to the annals of he later han dynasty yamato was the most powerful later official chinese historian also tells us thatjih pên our japan and yamato had been two different states and thatjih pênwas reported to have swallowed up yamato byjih pênthe author evidently meant to speak of the island of tsukushi or of part of it that the chinese were fairly well acquainted with japan is shown by the fact of there being in the old chinese literature more than one mention of the country of the hairy people beyond the mountains in the lxxxvii paragraph continues east and north —that is of the yemishi or ainos no chinese book would seem to mention idzumo as having formed separate country and this evidence must be allowed its whole weight it is possible of course that idzumo may have been incorporated with yamato before the conquest of the latter by the tsukushi people and in this case some of the inconsistencies of the history may be traceable to confusion of the traditions concerning the conquest of idzumo by yamato and of those concerning the conquest of yamato by tsukushi perhaps too for so almost impossible task is it to reconstruct history out of legend there may not after all be sufficient warrant for believing in the former existence of idzumo as separate state though it certainly seems hard to account otherwise for the peculiar place that idzumo occupies in mythic story in any case and whatever light may hereafter be thrown on this very obscure question it must be remembered that so far as clear native documentary evidence reaches is approximately the highest limit of reliable japanese history beyond that date we are at once confronted with the miraculous and if any facts relative to earlier japan are to be extracted from the pages of the records and chronicles it must be by process very different from that of simply reading and taking their assertions upon trust with regard to the origin or rather to the significance of the clearly fanciful portions of the japanese legends the question here mooted as to the probability of the japanese mythology being mixed one warns us to exercise more than usual caution in endeavouring to interpret it in fact it bids us wait to interpret it until lxxxviii such time as further research shall have shown which legends belong together for if they are of heterogeneous origin it is hopeless to attempt to establish genealogical tree of the gods and the very phrase so often heard indiscussionson this subject the original religious beliefs of the japanese —ceases to have any precise meaning for different beliefs may have been equally ancient and original but distinguished geographically by belonging to different parts of the country furthermore it may not be superfluous to call attention to the fact that the gods who are mentioned in the opening phrases of the histories as we now have them are not therefore necessarily the gods that were most anciently worshipped surely in religions as in books it is not often the preface that is written first and yet this simple consideration has been constantly neglected and one after another european writers having tincture of knowledge of japanese mythology tell us of original dualities trinities and supreme deities without so much as pausing to notice that the only two authorities in the matter —viz the records and the chronicles differ most gravely in the lists they furnish of primary gods if the present writer ventured to throw out suggestion where so many random assertions have been made it would be to the effect that the various abstractions which figure at the commencement of the records and of the chronicles were probably later growths and perhaps indeed mere inventions of individuals priests there is nothing either in the histories or in the shintō rituals to show that these gods or some one or more of them were in early days as has been sometimes supposed the objects of pure worship which was lxxxix afterwards obscured by the legends of izanagi izanami and their numerous descendants on the contrary with the exception of the deity taka mi musu bi they are no sooner mentioned than they vanish into space whether it is intrinsically likely that so rude race as the early japanese and race so little given to metaphysical speculation as the japanese at all times of their history should have commenced by highly abstract worship which they afterwards completely abandoned is question which may better be left to those whose general knowledge of early peoples and early religious beliefs entitles their decisions to respect their assistance likewise even after the resolution of the japanese mythology into its several component parts must be called in by the specialist to help in deciding how much of this mythology shouldbeinterpreted according to the solar method now so popular in england how much should be accepted as history more or less perverted how much should be regarded as embodying attempts at explaining facts in nature and what residue may be rejected as simple fabrication of the priesthood in comparatively late times those who are personally acquainted with the japanese character will probably incline to enlarge the area of the three later divisions more than would be prudent in the case of the highly imaginative aryans and to point out that though some few japanese legends xc portions of legends can be traced to face etymologies invented to account for names of places and are therefore true myths in the strictacceptationof the term yet the kindred process whereby personality is ascribed to inanimate objects —a process which lies at the very root of aryan mythology —is altogether alien to the japanese genius and indeed to the far eastern mind in general mythology thus originated has been aptly described as disease of language but all persons are not liable to catch the same disease neither presumably are all languages and it is hard to see how linguistic disease which consists in mistaking metaphor for reality can attack tongue to which metaphor even in its tamest shape is an almost total stranger thus not only have japanese nouns no genders and japanese verbs no persons but the names of inanimate objects cannot even be used as the subjects of transitive verbs nowhere for instance in japanese whether archaic classical or modem do we meet with such metaphorical —mythological —phrases as the hot wind melts the ice or his conversation delights me where the words wind and conversation are spoken of as if they were personal agents no the idea is invariably rendered in some other and impersonal way yet what distance separates such statements in which the ordinary european reader unacquainted with any altaic tongue would scarcely recognize the existence of any personification at all from the bolder flights of aryan metaphor indeed though altaic asia has produced very few wise men the words of its languages closely correspond to the definition of words as the wise man counters for they are colourless and matter of fact and rarely if ever carry him who xci speaks them above the level of sober reality at the same time it is patent that the sun playssomepart in the japanese mythology and even the legend of prince yamato take which has hitherto been generally accepted as historical or semi historical bears such close resemblance to legends in other countries which have been pronounced to be solar by great authorities that it may at least be worth while to subject it to investigation from that point of view the present writer has already expressed his conviction that this matter is not one for the specialist to decide alone he would only from the japanese point of view suggest very particular caution in the application to japanese legend of method of interpretation which has elsewhere been fruitful of great results further particular which is deserving of notice is the almost certain fact of recension of the various traditions at comparatively late date this is partly shown by the amount of geographical knowledge displayed in the enumeration of the various islands supposed to have been given birth to by izanagi and izanami the male who invites and the female who invites —an amount and an exactness of knowledge unattainable at time prior to the union under one rule of all the provinces mentioned and significantly not extending much beyond those provinces such recension may likewise be inferred —if the opinion of the manifold origin of the japanese traditions be accepted —from the fairly ingenious manner in which their component parts have generally been welded together the way in which one or two legends —for instance that of the curious curse pronounced xcii by the younger brother ho wori on the elder ho deri—are repeated more than once exemplifies less intelligent revision under this heading may perhaps be included the legends of the conquest of yamato by the emperor jim mu and of the conquest of the same country by the empress jin go which certainly bear suspicious likeness to each other of the subjection of korea by this last named personage it should be observed that the chinese and korean histories so far as they are known to us make no mention and indeed the dates as more specially given in the chronicles clearly show the inconsistency of the whole story for jin gō husband the emperor chiū ai is said to have been born in the th year of the reign of sei mu in while his father prince yamato take is said to have died in the rd year of kei kō in so that there is an interval of thirty six years between the death of the father and the birth of the son one peculiarly interesting piece of information to be derived from careful study of the records and chronicles though it is one on which the patriotic japanese commentators preserve complete silence is that at the very earliest period to which the twilight of legend stretches back chinese influence had already begun to xciii make itself felt in these islands communicating to the inhabitants both implements and ideas this is surely fact of very particular importance lending as it does its weight to the mass of evidence which goes to prove that in almost all known cases culture has been introduced from abroad and has not been spontaneously developed the traces of chinese influence are indeed not numerous but they are unmistakable thus we find chopsticks mentioned both in the idzumo and in the kiushu legendary cycle the legend of the birth of the sun goddess and moon god from izanagi eyes is scarcely altered fragment of the chinese myth of p’an ku the superstition that peaches had assisted izanagi to repel the hosts of hades can almost certainly be traced to chinese source and the hand maidens of the japanese sun goddess are mentioned under the exact title of the spinning damsel of chinese myth while the river of heaven which figures in the same legend is equally chinese —for surely both names cannot be mere coincidences like remark applies to the name of the deity of the kitchen and to the way in which that deity is mentioned the art of making an intoxicating liquor is referred to in the very earliest japanese legends are we to believe that its invention here was independent of its invention on the continent in this instance moreover the old histories bear witness against themselves for they mention this same liquor in terms showing that it was curious rarity in what according to the accepted chronology corresponds to the century immediately preceding the christian era and again in the third century of that era the whole story xciv of the sea god palace has chinese ring about it and the cassia tree mentioned in it is certainly chinese as are the crocodiles that the so calledmaga tama or curved jewels which figure so largely in the japanese mythology and with which the early japanese adorned themselves were derived from china was already suspected by mr henry von siebold and quite latterly mr milne has thrown light on this subject from an altogether unexpected quarter he has remarked namely that jade or the jade like stone of which many of themaga tamaare made is mineral which has never yet been met with in japan we therefore know that some at least of the curved jewels or of the material for them came from the mainland and the probability that the idea of carving these very oddly shaped ornaments was likewise imported thence gains in probability the peculiar kind of arrow callednari kabura is another trace of chinese influence in the material order and thorough search by competent chinese scholar would perhaps reveal others but enough at least has been said to show the indisputable existence of that influence from other sources we know that the more recent mythic fancy of japan has shown itself as little impenetrable to such influence as have the manners and customs of the people the only difference is that assimilation has of late proceeded with much greater rapidity in this language is another guide for though the discoverable traces of chinese influence are comparatively few in the archaic dialect yet they are there this is subject which has as yet scarcely been touched two japanese authors of an elder generation kahibara and xcv paragraph continues arawi hakuseki did indeed point out the existence of some such traces but they drew no inference from them they did not set to work to discover new ones and their indications except in one or two obvious cases have received little attention from later writer whether native or foreign but when we compare such words askane kume kuni saka tana uma and many others with the pronunciation now given or with that which the phonetic laws of the language in its earlier stage would have caused to be given to their chinese equivalents etc the idea forces way that such coincidences of sound and sense cannot all be purely accidental and when moreover we find that the great majority of the words in question denote things or ideas that were almost certainly imported we perceive that more thorough sifting of archaic japanese especially of botanical and zoological names and of the names of implements and manufactures would probably be the best means of discovering at least the negative features of an antiquity remoter than all written documents remoter even than the crystallization of the legends which these documents have preserved in dealing with korean words found in archaic japanese we tread on more delicate ground for there we have language which unlike chinese stands to japanese in the closest family relationship making it plain that many coincidences of sound and sense should be ascribed to radical affinity rather than to later intercourse at the same time it appears more probable that for instance such seemingly indigenous japanese terms ashotoke buddha andtera buddhist temple should have been in fact borrowed from the corresponding korean wordspuchhöand xcvi chölthan that both nations should have independently chosen homonyms to denote the same foreign ideas indeed it will perhaps not be too bold to assume that in the case ofhotoke buddha we have before us word whose journeyings consist of many stages it having been first brought from india to china then from china to korea and thirdly from korea to japan where finally the ingenuity of philologists has discovered for it japanese etymology hito ke human spirit with which in reality it has nothing whatever to do these introductory remarks have already extended to such length that reference to the strikingly parallel case of borrowed customs and ideas which is presented by the ainos in this same archipelago must be left undeveloped in conclusion it need only be remarked that simple translation of one book such as is here given does not nearly exhaust the work which might be expended even on the elucidation of that single book and much less can it fill the gap which still lies between us and proper knowledge of japanese antiquity to do this the co operation of the archaeologist must be obtained while even in the field of the critical investigation of documents there is an immense deal still to be clone not only must all the available japanese sources be made to yield up the information which they contain but the assistance of chinese and korean records must be called in large quantity of chinese literature has already been ransacked for similar purpose by matsushita ken rin translation of part of whose very useful compilation entitled an exposition of the foreign notices of japan would be one of the greatest helps towards the desired knowledge in fact xcvii there still remains to be done for japanese antiquity from our standpoint what hirata has done for it from the standpoint of japanese shintoist except in some of mr satow papers published in these transactions the subject has scarcely yet been studied in this spirit and it is possible that the japanese members of our society may be somewhat alarmed at the idea of their national history being treated with so little reverence perhaps however the discovery of the interest of the field of study thus only waiting to be investigated may reconcile them to the view here propounded in any case if the early history of japan is not all true no amount of make believe can make it so what we would like to do is to sift the true from the false as an eminent writer on anthropology has recently said historical criticism that is judgment is practised not for the purpose of disbelieving but of believing its object is not to find fault with the author but to ascertain how much of what he says may be reasonably taken as true moreover even in what is not to be accepted as historic fact there is often much that is valuable from other points of view if therefore we lose thousand years of so called japanese history it must not be forgotten that japanese mythology remains as the oldest existing product of the altaic mind

translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com yasumaro say now when chaos had begun to condense but force and form were not yet manifest and there was nought named nought done who could know its shape nevertheless heaven and earth first parted and the three deities performed the commencement of creation the passive and active essences then developed and the two spirits became the ancestors of all things therefore did he enter obscurity and emerge into light and the sun and moon were revealed by the washing of his eyes he floated on and plunged into the sea water and heavenly and earthly deities appeared through the ablutions of his person so in the dimness of the great commencement we by relying on the original teaching learn the time of the conception of the earth and of the birth of islands in the remoteness of the original beginning we by trusting the former sages perceive the era of the genesis of deities and of the establishment of men truly do we know that mirror was hung up that jewels were spat out and that then an hundred kings succeeded each other that blade was bitten and serpent cut in pieces so that myriad deities did flourish by deliberations in the tranquil river the paragraph continues empire was pacified by discussions on the little shore the land was purified wherefore his augustness ho no ni ni gi first descended to the peak of takachi and the heavenly sovereign kamu yamato did traverse the island of the dragon fly weird bear put forth its claws and heavenly sabre was obtained at takakura they with tails obstructed the path and great crow guided him to yeshinu dancing in rows they destroyed the brigands and listening to song they vanquished the foemen being instructed in dream he was reverent to the heavenly and earthly deities and was therefore styled the wise monarch having gazed on the smoke he was benevolent to the black haired people and is therefore remembered as the emperor sage determining the frontiers and civilising the country he issued laws from the nearer afumi reforming the surnames and selecting the gentile names he held sway at the further asuka though each differed in caution and in ardour though all were unlike in accomplishments and in intrinsic worth yet was there none who did not by contemplating antiquity correct manners that had fallen to ruin and by illumining modern times repair laws that were approaching dissolution in the august reign of the heavenly sovereign who governed the eight great islands from the great palace of kiyomihara at asuka the hidden dragon put on perfection the reiterated thunder came at the appointed moment having heard song in dream he felt that he should continue the succession having reached the water at night he knew that he should receive the inheritance nevertheless heaven time was not yet and he escaped like the cicada to the southern mountains both men and matters were favourable and he marched like the tiger to the eastern land suddenly riding in the imperial palanquin he forced his way across mountains and rivers the six divisions rolled like thunder the three hosts sped like lightning the erect spears lifted up their might and the bold warriors arose like smoke the crimson flags glistened among the weapons and the ill omened crew were shattered like tiles or ere day had elapsed the evil influences were purified forthwith were the cattle let loose and the horses given repose as with shouts of victory they returned to the flowery summer the flags were rolled up and the javelins put away as with dances and chants they came to rest in the capital city the year was that of the cock and it was in the second moon at the great palace of kiyomihara did he ascend to the heavenly seat in morality he outstripped ken kō in virtue he surpassed shiū having grasped the celestial seals he was paramount over the six cardinal points having obtained the heavenly supremacy he annexed the eight wildernesses he held the mean between the two essences and regulated the order of the five elements he established divine reason herewith to advance good customs he disseminated brilliant usages wherewith to make the land great moreover the ocean of his wisdom in its vastness profoundly investigated the highest antiquity the mirror of his heart in its fervour clearly observed former ages hereupon the heavenly sovereign commanded saying hear that the chronicles of the emperors and likewise the original words in the possession of the various families deviate from exact truth and are mostly amplified by empty falsehoods if at the present time these imperfections be not amended ere many years shall have elapsed the purport of this the great basis of the country the grand foundation of the monarchy will be destroyed so now desire to have the chronicles of the emperors selected and recorded and the old words examined and ascertained falsehoods being erased and the truth deter mined in order to transmit the latter to after ages at that time there was retainer whose surname was hiyeda and his personal name are he was twenty eight years old and of so intelligent disposition that he could repeat with his mouth whatever met his eyes and record in his heart whatever struck his ears forthwith are was commanded to learn by heart the genealogies of the emperors and likewise the words of former ages nevertheless time elapsed and the age changed and the thing was not yet carried out prostrate consider how her majesty the empress having obtained unity illumines the empire —being versed in the triad

eminent than ten itsu hereupon regretting the errors in the old words and wishing to correct the misstatements in the former chronicles she on the eighteenth day of the ninth month of the fourth year of wa do commanded me yasumaro to select and record the old words learnt by heart by hiyeda no are according to the imperial decree and dutifully to lift them up to her in reverent obedience to the contents of the decree have made careful choice but in high antiquity both speech and thought were so simple that it would be difficult to arrange phrases and compose periods in the characters to relate everything in an ideographic transcription would entail an inadequate expression of the meaning to write altogether according to the phonetic method would make the story of events unduly lengthy for this reason have sometimes in the same sentence used the phonetic and ideographic systems conjointly and have sometimes in one matter used the ideographic record exclusively moreover where the drift of the words was obscure have by comments elucidated their signification but need it be said that have nowhere commented on what was easy again in such cases as calling the surnamekusaka and the personal name written with the charactertarashi have followed usage without alteration altogether the things recorded commence with the separation of heaven and earth and conclude with the august

common japanese practice borrowed from the chinese to use the words upper middle and lower to denote the first second and third volumes of work respectively the peculiar nature of this preface which is but atour de forcemeant to show that the writer could compose in the chinese style if he chose to do so has been already hinted at in the introduction it is indeed laboured little composition and but for the facts stated in its latter portion has no value except perhaps as specimen of the manner in which the legends of one country may be made to change aspect by being presented through the medium of the philosophical terminology and set phrases of another it may be divided into five parts in the first the writer in succession of brief allusions antithetically balanced summarizes the most striking of the legends that are detailed in the pages of his records and in few words paints the exploits of some of the early emperors in the second the troubles that ushered in the reign of the emperor tem mu and his triumph over prince ohotomo are related at greater length in high flown allusive phrases borrowed from the chinese historians the third division gives us the emperor temmu decree ordering the compilation of the records and the fourth tells how the execution of that decree was delayed till the reign of the empress gemmiyō on whom likewise panegyric is pronounced in the fifth and last the compiler enters into some details concerning the style and method he has adopted the first personal pronoun is here represented by the humble character vassal used in china by subject when addressing his sovereign in writing this is the compiler personal name his full name and titles as given at the end of this preface werei the court noble futo no yasumaro an officer of

yasumaro death is recorded in the chronicles of japan continued under date of th august report as follows to her majesty the empress in the primeval void which preceded all phenomena there was neither form nor movement and it was therefore unnamed and unknowable this sentence summarizes the first eight sections of the text of the records the three deities are the deity master of the august centre of heaven the high august producing wondrous deity see sect notes and the two spirits representing the passive and active elements are the creatrix and creator izanami and izanagi the female who invites and the male who invites —see sect ii note the procreation by whom of the islands of the japanese archipelago and of large number of gods and goddesses forms the subject of sections iii vii the word therefore is not appropriate in this place and motowori accordingly warns the reader to lay no stress upon it this sentence alludes to izanagi visit to hades and to the purification of his person on his return to the upper world see sects ix and it also refers to the birth of the sun goddess and of the moon god from his left and from his right eye respectively and to that of large number of lesser gods and goddesses who were produced from every article of his wearing apparel and from every part of his person on the occasion of his performing those ablutions see sect the original teaching here mentioned means the original traditions of japanese antiquity the former sages —a term which in china fitly designates such philosophers as confucius and mencius but which it is difficult to invest with any particular sense here in japan where no sages have ever arisen —may be best taken to mean those unknown persons who transmitted the legends of the gods and early emperors the establishment of men probably alludes to the investiture of thep sovereignty of japan in the human descendants of the sun goddess the expression is however obscure and motowori himself has nothing satisfactory to tell us about it the mirror here mentioned is that by means of which the sun goddess was allured out of the cave see sect xvi the jewels are those which susa no wo the impetuous male deity begged of his sister the sun goddess and crunched into fragments see sect xiii the blade that was bitten to pieces by the sun goddess figures in the same legend the serpent is that slain by susa no wo after his banishment from heaven see sect xviii the myriad deities are supposed by motowori to be this same god numerous descendants see sect xx who ruled in idzumo there remains the phrase an hundred kings which is lacking in clearness the only rational interpretation of it is as designating the japanese imperial line and yet the reference seems to have no special appropriateness in this context for the tranquil river of heaven in whose stony bed the gods were wont to meet in council see sect xiii note the divine deliberations here referred to are those which resulted in the investiture of the sovereignty of japan in the grandson of the sun goddess see sects xxx xxxiii the discussions on the little shore allude to the parleys on the beach of inasa in idzumo which preceded the abdication of the deity who had held sway over that part of the country prior to the descent of the sun goddess grandson see sect xxxii the abbreviated form of the name of the sun goddess grandson see sect xxxiii notes and mount takachiho see sect xxxiv note the final syllable is here apocopated in order to preserve the rhythmical balance of the sentence by using only three chinese characters to write this name the island of the dragon fly being likewise written with three characters the first human emperor jim mu whose full native japanese name is kamu yamato ihare biko for the account of his reign see sects xliv lii japan for the traditional origin of this poetical synonym of japan see sect note and also the legend in sect clvi the word traverse in this sentence alludes to the emperor jim mu victorious progress from western japan to yamato in the centre of the country which he is said to have subdued and where it is related that he established his capital see sect xliv for the mention of the bear whose appearance caused the emperor jim mu and his army to faint away see commencement of sect xlv motowori thinks that the character claws is copyist error for mountain or hole conf sect xlv note for the curious legend of the sabre see the same section and for the name of takakura see more especially note to that section for the gods with tails who met and conversed with the emperor jim mu in yamato see the latter part of sect xlvi perusal of which will however show that the phrase obstructed the path which is here used of them is not exactly applicable the miraculous crow which was sent down from heaven to assist jim mu in his conquests is mentioned at the commencement of the same section and again at the commencement of sect xlvii for yeshinu modern yoshino see sect xlvi note the word dancing in this sentence must not be too closely pressed as it is used simply to balance the word song in the parallel clause —which clause itself does but echo the sense of that which precedes it the reference is to the song which jim mu sang as signal to his followers to destroy the earth spiders see sect xlviii and perhaps also to the songs in sect xlix the emperor su jin must be mentally supplied as the logical subject of this clause for the story of his dream see sect lxiv and for the origin of the laudatory designation here mentioned see the end of sect lxvii which is however obscure the emperor nin toku must be supplied as the logical subject of this clause the allusion to the smoke and the laudatory designation here mentioned will be understood by reference to sect cxxi the black haired people is common chinese phrase for the peasantry or the people in general the emperor sei mu must be supplied as the logical subject of this clause his labours are briefly recapitulated in sect xciv for the province called nearer afumi chika tsu afumi see sect xxix note its name is here rhythmically balanced against further asuka in the following clause the emperor in giyō must be supplied as the logical subject of this sentence this sovereign rectification of the names forms the subject of sect cxxxix for further asuka toho tsu asuka see sect cxxxiii notes and though unlike in character some of the ancient emperors excelling in caution and others in ardour some being remarkable for theirp attainments others for their native worth yet was there not one without claim to greatness not one who did not regard antiquity as the standard by which modern times should be judged and repair the deviations from antique perfection that successively arose during the lapse of ages —how marvellously inapplicable is this rodomontade to the early monarchs of japan the student of japanese history need scarcely be told and motowori himself allows that it is not completely appropriate here the first part of the preface terminates viz the emperor tem mu whose struggle for the crown in the latter part of the seventh century of our era against the contending claims of prince ohotomo is related at great length in the pages of the chronicles though naturally beyond the scope of these records which close in the eight great islands is one of the synonyms of japan see sect note the reason for the specially laudatory mention in this place of the emperor tem mu is the fact that it was with him that the idea of compiling these records originated as is indeed stated little further on he is here alluded to by the expressions hidden dragon and reiterated thunder metaphorical names borrowed from the yi ching and denoting the heir apparent temmu not having ascended the throne till some time after his predecessor death as prince ohotomo disputed by force of arms his right to the succession the phrases put on perfection and came at the appointed moment are attempts at representing the originaland the meaning is that the emperor tem mu was the man for the age and that he took his proper and exalted place in it in the following sentences we have floweryrésuméof the story of the successful war by which he obtained the crown the reference to the song in dream is indeed obscure but the water at night is the river yoko which we read of in the chronicles as having been crossed by him the characters somewhat freely rendered by the english words succession and inheritance areand which approximate to that sense in this context the southern mountains are the mountains of yoshino whither he escaped for season as cicada escapes from its cast off shell the eastern land denotes the eastern provinces of japan where he organized his army the six divisions and the three hosts are chinese designations of the imperial troops while the ill omened crew of course refers to tem mu enemies —prince ohotomo and his followers in the ensuing sentence we see peace restored tem mu has returned to the capital for which the words flowery summer are chinese periphrasis he has taken in his hands the insignia of office and reignsp supreme over the six cardinal points north south east west above and below and over the eight wildernesses the barbarous regions on all sides the writer concludes this division of his preface by glowing panegyric of the monarch who was he says superior to hsüan hou jap ken kō and chou wang jap shiū famous chinese sovereigns of the legendary period so intelligent were his efforts so perfect was his conformity with the ways of heaven as displayed in the workings of the active and passive essences that the five elements water fire wood metal and earth all interacted with due regularity and laudable usages alone prevailed throughout the land up to this point the preface may be said to be purely ornamental march th as the chronicles tell us the original to denote the year and the month mentioned uses the periphrasesandbut doubtless without any reference to the original proper meaning of those terms the text literally reads thus he rode in the exactness of the two essences but the author intention is to tell us that tem mu acted according to the golden mean keeping the balance even and not inclining unduly either to the active or the passive side literally warp and woof cannon standard mainspring first necessity this is the imperial decree ordering the compilation of the records of ancient matters the expressions original words and old words are curious and motowori is probably right in arguing from the emphatic manner in which they are repeated that the emperor tem mu attached special importance to the actual archaic phraseology in which some at least of the early documents or traditions had been handed down he could repeat the contents of any document that he had once seen and remember all that he had ever heard the emperor tem mu died before the plan of the compilation of these records had been carried into execution viz it may be presumed before selection from the various original documents committed to memory by are had been reduced to writing for the phrase obtaining unity which is borrowed from lao tzū the student should consult stanislas judien livre de la voie et de le vertu pp the triad is the threefold intelligence of heaven earth and man the general meaning of the sentence is that the empress perfect virtue which is in completep accord with the heavenly ordinances is spread abroad throughout the empire and that with her all penetrating insight she nourishes and sustains her people in the above four sentences the compiler expresses his respectful admiration of the empress gem miyo who was on the throne at the time when he wrote and tells us how wide was her rule and how prosperous her reign the purple palace is one of the ornamental names borrowed from the chinese to denote the imperial residence the sombre retinue if such indeed is the correct rendering of the original expression is phrase on which no authority consulted by the translator throws any light the utmost limits of the horses hoof marks and the furthest distance attained to by vessels prows are favourite phrases in the old literature of japan to express extreme distance see for instance mr satow translations of the ritual of the praying for harvest vol vii pt ii of these transactions and the present writer classical poetry of the japanese such unusual phenomena as connected stalks trunks springing from the same root and uniting again higher up and joint rice ears two rice ears growing on single stem are considered lucky omens by the chinese and their appearance is duly chronicled in those japanese histories that are composed after the chinese model the continuous beacon fires and the repeated interpretations are phrases alluding to the foreign lands the various small korean states speaking strange languages whence tribute was sent to japan the text as it stands gives the impression that the arrival of the tribute ships was announced by beacon fires being lighted motowori however wishes us to understand the author meaning to be that foreign states which in the natural course of events would be inimical and the approach of whose ships would be signalized by the lighting of beacon fires now peacefully sent gifts to the japanese monarch it may be added that the whole sentence is borrowed scarcely without alteration from the wên hsüan bum mei is the japanese pronunciation of the characters the original name of yü celebrated legendary emperor of china ten itsu is the japanese pronunciation of the characters the original name of the ancient emperor t’ang who is said to have founded the shang dynasty in the eighteenth century this word is here used as an initial particle without special significance rd november wa dō is the name of japanese year period which lasted from to present them to her with this sentence ends the fourth division of the preface the simplicity of speech and thought in early japan renders it too hard task to rearrange the old documents committed to memory by are in such manner as to make them conform to the rules of chinese style if adopted in its entirety the chinese ideographic method of writing should often fail of giving true impression of the nature of the original documents conf the preceding note if on the other hand consistently used the chinese characters syllable by syllable as phonetic symbols for japanese sounds this work would attain to inordinate proportions on account of the great length of the polysyllabic japanese as compared with the monosyllabic chinese the author meaning may be illustrated by referring to the first clause of the records when heaven and earth began which is thus written ideographically with six chinese characters whereas it would require no less than eleven to write it phonetically so as to represent the sound of the japanese wordsame tsuchi no hazhime no toki viz it should be noticed that in this passage the author employs the technical expressionsonandkun and in manner which is the precise reverse of that sanctioned by modern usage onbeing with him the phonetic andkunthe ideographic acceptation of the chinese characters it will be seen by perusing the following translation that the author can scarcely be said to have vouchsafed as much exegetical matter as this statement would lead us to expect indeed his comments are mostly confined to information concerning the pronunciation of certain characters see however motowori remarks on this sentence in vol ii pp of this commentary the author here refers to certain class of japanese words which offer peculiar difficulties because written neither ideographically nor phonetically but in completely arbitrary manner the result of freak of usage his manner of expressing himself is however ambiguous what he meant to say is as motowori points out again in such cases as writing the surnamekusaka with the characters and the personal nametarashiwith the character have followed usage without alteration it is his imperfect mastery over the chinese construction that makes him fall into such errors —errors easily rectifiable however by the more widely read modern japaneseliterati commence with the creation and end with the death of the empress

becoming is concisely defined by motowori as the birth of that which did not exist before in japanesetakama no hara ame no mi naka nushi no kami taka mi musu bi no kami it is open to doubt whether the syllablebi instead of signifying wondrous may not simply be verbal termination in which case the three syllablesmusubiwould mean not wondrous producing but simple producing if we adopt the interpretation of the verbmusubuas to produce in the active sense of the word an interpretation as to whose propriety there is some room for doubt in the absence of certainty the translator has followed the view expressed by motowori and adopted by hirata the same remark applies to the following and other similar names kami musu bi no kami this name reappears in later sections under the lengthened form ofami musu bi mi oya no mikoto his augustness the deity producing wondrous august ancestor and also in abbreviated forms they all came into existence without being procreated in the manner usual with both gods and men and afterwards disappeared died here and elsewhere the character properly country regio is used where earth tellus better suits the sense apparently in the old language the wordkuni written which is now restricted to the former meaning was used ambiguously somewhat like our word land umashi ashi kabi hiko ji no kami forhikohere and elsewhere rendered prince see introductionp xvi jiis rendered elder in accordance with the opinion expressed by motowori and hirata who say that it is an honorific designation of males identical with thejimeaning old man or the deity standing eternally in heaven ame no toko tachi no kami the translation of the name here given follows the natural meaning of the characters composing it and has the sanction of tanigaha shisai motowori and hirata taketokoto stand forsoko bottom and interpret accordingly but this is probably but one of the many instances in which the japanese philologists allow themselves to be led by the boldness of their etymological speculations into identifying words radically distinct this is note in the original where such notes are indented as has also been clone in the translation the author obscure phrase is explained by motowori to mean that these heavenly deities were separate from those who came into existence afterwards and especially from the earthly eternally standing deity kuni no toko tachi no kami who in the chronicles is the first divine being of whom mention is made these five were he says separate and had nothing to do with the creation of the world it should be stated that the sentence will also bear the interpretation the five deities in the above list are deities who divided heaven presumably from earth but this rendering has against it the authority of all the native editors as the expressions heavenly deity and earthly deity lit country deity are of frequent occurrence in these records it may be as well to state that according to motowori the heavenly deities were such as either dwelt in heaven or had originally descended to earth from heaven whereas the earthly deities were those born and dwelling in japan next section ii —the seven divine generations the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com the names of the deities that were born next were the earthly eternally standing deity next the luxuriant

one generation of the succeeding ten deities each pair of deities is called generation or the deity standing eternally on earth kuni no toko tachi no kami conf note to sect toyo kumo nu no kami there is much doubt as to the proper interpretation of this name the characters cloud moor with which the syllables readkumo nuare written are almost certainly phonetic and the translator has followed motowori view as corrected by hirata according to whichkumois taken to stand forkumu integrating andnuis considered to be an apocopated form ofnushi master or more vaguely the person who presides at or does thing mabuchi in his dictionary of pillow words articlesasutake argues that the syllables in question should be interpreted in the sense of coagulated mud out this is less satisfactory hiji no kamiandsu hiji ni no kami the names of this pair tend themselves to variety of interpretations motowori view of the meaning of the first three syllables in each seems best if it is founded on the chinese characters with which they are written in the parallel passage of the chronicles and it has therefore been adopted here hirata interprets the names thus first mud lord and first sand lady and takesnito be an alternative form of the honorificnefound in so many proper names this view of the meaning ofnihas been followed by the translator on the other hand mabuchi explains the names to mean respectively floating mud earth and sinking mud earth the only thing therefore that is granted by all is that the names in question refer to the mud or slime out of which the world was afterwards made the reader will bear in mind that younger sister and wife are convertible names in archaic japanese see introduction xxxviii tsunu guhi no kamiandiku guhi no kami the interpretation given is one in

were given to them from the gradual progress of creation izana gi no kamiandizana mi no kami there is some slight diversity of opinion as to the literal signification of the component parts of the names of these the best known of the deities hitherto mentioned though the gist of the meaning remains unchanged motowori would prefer to readiza na giandiza mi taking the syllablenaas the second personal pronoun thou and understanding the names thus the prince who invites thee and the princess who invites thee it seems however more natural to look onizanaas forming but one word viz the root of the verbizanafu to invite the older native commentatorsp mean the same thing when they tell us thatnais an expletive the syllablesgiandmiare of uncertain etymology but occur in other archaic words to denote the female and male of pair the appropriateness of the names of these deities will be seen by referring to sect iv for explanatory notes which are printed in small type in the original small type is likewise used in this translation next section iii —the island of onogoro the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com hereupon all the heavenly deities commanded the two deities his augustness the male who invites and her augustness the female who invites ordering them to make consolidate and give birth to this drifting land granting to them an heavenly jewelled spear they thus deigned to charge them so the two deities standing upon the floating bridge of heaven pushed down the jewelled spear and stirred with it whereupon when they had stiffed the brine till it went curdle curdle and drew the spear up the brine that dripped down from the end of the spear was piled up and became an island this is the island of onogoro for this rendering of the japanese titlemikotosee introduction xvi last paragraph the characters translated jewelled spear are whose proper chinese signification would be quite different but the first of the two almost certainly stands phonetically foror —the syllablenu which is its sound having apparently been an ancient word for jewel or head the better known japanese term beingtama in many places the word jewel or jewelled seems to be used simply as an adjective expressive of beauty but motowori and hirata credit it in this instance with its proper signification and the translator always renders it literally leaving the reader to consider it to be used metaphorically if and where he pleases ama no uki hashi or ame no uki hashi the best authorities are at variance as to the nature of this bridge uniting heaven with earth hirata identifies it with the heavenly rock boat ame no iha fune mentioned in some ancient writings whereas motowori takes it to have been real bridge and finds traces of it and of similar bridges in the so called heavenly stairs ama no hashi date which are found on several points of the coast forming kind of natural breakwater just above water level till it became thick and glutinous it is not easy to find in english word which will aptly render the original japanese onomatopoeiakoworokoworo the meaning may also be till it made curdling sound but though the character to make noise sanctions this view it is not the view approved by the commentators andis probably only written phonetically for homonymous word signifying to become which we find in the parallel passage of the chronicles self curdling self condensed it is supposed to have been one of the islets off the coast of the larger island of ahaji next section iv —courtship of the deities the male who invites and the

the english locution to which it literally corresponds and it has here been rendered accordingly though with considerable hesitation hirata does not approve of motowori view but then the different text which he here adopts imposes on him the necessity of another interpretation see his exposition of the ancient histories vol ii pp the original wordhiro written is defined as the distance between

to have dwindled down to simple honorific —it is this little island which is said by the author of the chronicles to have been the caul with which the great island of yamato was born ahaji and ho no

derivations areyama to without the mountains yama ato mountain traces andyama todomi mountains stopping as moribe who proposes it explains far as the mountains can be seen another disputed point is whether the name of yamato which here designates the main island of the archipelago but which in the common parlance of both ancient and modern times is the denomination on the one hand of the single province of yamato and on the other of the whole empire of japan originally had the wider application or the more restricted one motowori and the author of the exposition of the foreign notices of

viscid prince and next the deity clay viscid princess the names of the deities that were next born from her urine were the deity mitsuhanome and next the young wondrous producing deity the child of this deity was called the deity luxuriant food princess so the deity the female who invites through giving birth to the deity of fire at length divinely retired eight deities in all from the heavenly bird boat to the deity luxuriant food princess the total number of islands given birth to jointly by the two deities the male who invites and the female who invites was fourteen and of deities thirty five these are such as were given birth to before the deity princess who invites divinely retired only the island of onogoro was not given birth to and moreover the leech child and the island of aha are not reckoned among the children so then his augustness the male who invites said oh thine augustness my lovely younger sister oh that should have exchanged thee for this single child and as he crept round her august pillow and as he crept round her august feet and wept there was born from his august tears the deity that dwells at konomoto near unewo on mount kagu and whose name is the

has lost for him moribe in his examination of difficult words ko no hito tsu ki vol et seq ingeniously argues thatkiwas an old native japanese auxiliary numeral for animals afterwards driven out by the somewhat like sounding chinese wordhiki which is now in common use and that the god employs this degrading auxiliary numeral in speaking of his child on account of the resentment which he feels against him on the other hand we gather from the chronicles of japan explained thatwas used in its natural sense as an auxiliary numeral for gods and for men of exalted rank this seems to the translator the better view to follow and it is supported by the use ofp hashira as the regular auxiliary numeral for divine personages the parallel passage in the chronicles has simply one infant this rendering is but tentative for it is not certain that hirata whose view has been adopted is right in regarding konomoto and unewo as names of places if we followed the older authorities we should have to translate thus the deity that dwells at the foot of the trees on the slope of the spur of mount kagu the etymology of the name of this celebrated mountain known also asame no kagu yamaorama no kagu yama heavenly mount kagu is disputed but hirata view according to which it should be connected withkago deer is the most plausible if it were established we should be tempted to follow him in rendering by deer possessor the name of the deitykagu tsu chi of whom were born the eight gods of mountains and whose slaying forms the title of the next section that the fire deity should be connected with the mountain deities and thereby with the deer who roam about the mountains and furnish the hunter with motive for penetrating into their recesses is of course but natural the

lamentable indeed that thou earnest not sooner have eaten of the furnace of hades nevertheless as reverence the entry here of thine augustness my lovely elder brother wish to return moreover will discuss it particularly with the deities of hades look not at me having thus spoken she went back inside the palace and as she tarried there very long he could not wait so having taken and broken off one of the end teeth of the multitudinous and close toothed comb stuck in the august left bunch of his hair he lit one light and went in and looked maggots were swarming and she was rotting and in her head dwelt the great thunder in her breast dwelt the fire thunder in her left hand dwelt the young thunder in her right hand dwelt the earth thunder in her left foot dwelt the rumbling thunder in her right foot dwelt the couchant thunder —altogether eight thunder deities had been born and dwelt there hereupon his augustness the male who invites overawed at the sight fled back whereupon his younger sister her augustness the female who invites said thou hast put me to shame and at once sent the ugly female of hades to pursue him so his augustness the male who invites took his black august head dress and cast it down and it instantly turned into grapes while she picked them up and ate them he fled on but as she still pursued him he took and broke the multitudinous and close toothed comb in the right bunch of his hair and cast it down and it instantly turned into bamboo sprouts while she pulled them up and ate them he fled on again later his younger sister sent the eight thunder deities with thousand and five hundred warriors of hades to pursue him so he drawing the ten grasp sabre that was augustly girded on him fled forward brandishing it in his back hand and as they still pursued he took on reaching the base of the even pass of hades three peaches that were growing at its base and waited and smote his pursuers therewith so that they all fled back then his augustness the male who invites announced to the peaches like as ye have helped me so must ye help all living people in the central land of reed plains when they shall fall into troublous circumstances and be harassed —and he gave to the peaches the designation of their augustnesses great divine fruit last of all his younger sister her augustness the princess who invites came out herself in pursuit so he drew thousand draught rock and with it blocked up the even pass of hades and placed the rock in the middle and they stood opposite to one another and exchanged leave takings and her augustness the female who invites said my lovely elder brother thine augustness if thou do like this will in one day strangle to death thousand of the folks of thy land then his augustness the male who invites replied my lovely younger sister thine augustness ifthoudo this iwill in one day set up thousand and five hundred parturition houses in this manner each day thousand people would surely be born so her augustness the female who invites is called the great deity of hades again it is said that owing to her having pursued and reached her elder brother she is called the road reaching great deity again the rock with which he blocked up the pass of hades is called the great deity of the road turning back and again it is called the blocking great deity of the door of hades so what was called the even pass of

but what is to become of the text if we are at liberty to alter it to suit our convenience —for there is more than one other passage whereis similarly used yomo tsu kami both motowori and hirata take

nothing is known conf note to this section literally the male pillar the large tooth of which there is one at each end of the comb the use of the expression litonelight where it would have been more natural to say simply lit light is explained by gloss in the chronicles which informs us that at the present day the lighting of single light is considered unlucky as is also the throwing away of comb at night time it is allowed that the gloss is late addition and its statement might perhaps be considered mere invention made to account for the peculiar expression in the text motowori tells us however that it is said by the natives that these actions are still latter part of th century considered unlucky in the province of ihami and the same superstition also survives as the translator is assured in yedo itself it is to be understood that it was the large tooth broken off from the comb which the god lighted or arm or leg the japanese names of the eight thunder deities are oho ikadzuchi

translated head dress —leaves and flowers having been the earliest ornaments for the hair in later time however it has been usedp to designate any sort of head dress and that is also the dictionary

present visible ashi hara no naka tsu kuni common periphrastic designation of japan it is better to translate the name thus than to render it by the land in the middle of the reed plains forced interpretation which motowori and hirata would only seem to adopt in order to veil the fact that one of the most ancient and revered names of their native land was imitated from that of china —everything chinese being an abomination in the sight of these ardent shintoists yamazaki suiga as quoted by tanigaha shisei is more sensible when he remarks that each country naturally considers itself central and foreign countries barbarous and that japan is not peculiar in being looked on by its inhabitants as the centre of the universe this is also the view taken by the other earlier scholars oho kamu dzumi no mikoto the difference between singular and plural is not often present to the japanese mind and though there were three peaches we might just as well render their name by the words his augustness etc considering the three as forming together but one divinity the interpretation of the name here adopted is the simple and natural one which motowori borrowed from tanigaha shisei rock which it would take thousand men to lift that some kind of leave taking and separation is intended seems certain but the precise import of the charactersin the text is not to be ascertained motowori commentary vol vi pp and vol pp should be consulted for an elaborate discussion of the various interpretations which they may be made to bear moribe in his critique on this

between the various titles ofkimi wake murazhi etc are no longer to be ascertained if indeed they were ever sharply drawn and that kuni no miyatsuko here rendered rulers of the land seems to have been general term including all the rest and roughly corresponding to the modern title ofdaimyo —it must be well understood that all these names though properly and originally denoting an office were inherited as tides and ended after the custom of conferring new ones had died out by being little more than an extra surname appended to the surname proper uji this kind of quasi official quasi titular surname is what is called by the japanese akabane which the translator for want of better equivalent renders by gentile name motowori learned note in vol xxxix pp of his commentary should be consulted for full exposition of this somewhat intricate subject on which there has been much misapprehension chiefly owing to the want of fitting chinese character to denote the wordkabane here and throughout the work passages of this nature containing genealogies are in all the editions printed small and might therefore be supposed to be either intended as foot notes or to be later glosses

meaning of sacred thus certain family of priestsp was called by the name ofimibe lit the shunning clan on account of the uncleanness from which they were bound to abstain written with characters

passage in the chronicles omits to mention the metal of which the mirror was made but one account has the character metal in general often in chinese but rarely if ever in old japanese with the specific sense of gold the chronicles of old matters alone which are of very doubtful authenticity say that the mirror was made of copper copper was not discovered in japan till the eighth century of the christian era few years before the discovery of gold the best and most obvious course is to adhere to the character in the text which is as above stated iron the mines the original expression isame no kana yama ama tsusignifies of heaven but the rest of this name is not to be explained motowori adopts from the chronicles the reading ama tsu ma ura where the character used formasignifies true and that forurasignifies sea shore it should be remarked that the forging of spear by this personage is referred by the author of the chronicles not to the divine age but to the reign of the emperor sui zei motowori also proposes to supplement after the name the words to make spear hirata identifies this god withama no ma hito tsu no mikoto his augustness heavenly one eye who is however not mentioned in the records obvius hujus nominis sensus foret coelestis penis sed nullius commentatoris auctoritate commendatur this name is written in the chronicles with characters signifying stone coagulating old woman which however seem to be asp merely phonetic as those in the present text motowori proposes the interpretation of again forging old woman shikiri tome which is supported by tradition preserved in the gleanings of the ancient story where it is related that the mirror not having given satisfaction at first was forged second time there is long note on the subjects of this name in hirata exposition of the ancient histories vol ix where that author propounds the novel opinion that shi ko ri do me was not goddess at all but god tama noya no mikoto the chronicles write this name with characters signifying jewel house but such reading seems less good see sect xiii note ame no ko ya ne no mikoto also readsame noetc andama tsuetc the signification of the syllablesko ya

plausible opinion when he proposes to considertamaas an abbreviation oftamuke holding in the hands as an offering in connection with what we are told below about this deity andame no ko ya neholding the symbolic offerings the word true ma here and below is not much more than an honorific we might also though less well translate by mount kagu in heaven this would suit the view of motowori who is naturally averse to the identification of this mount kagu with the well known mountain of that name in yamato see sect vii note but of course an european scholar cannot allow of such distinction being drawn or perhaps the bark of the common birch is intended the word in the original ishaha ka see mr satow already quoted note in vol vii pt ii et seq and more especially pp of these transactions in

ofya ta fromya atama eight heads and supposes the mirror to have been not eight feet in length but octangular while moribe who in the case of the jewels accepts the obvious interpretation eight feet long thinks that the mirror had an eightfold flowery pattern yaha na gata round its border but both these etymologies are unsupported by the other cases in which the wordya taoccurs and are rendered specially untenable by the fact of the mirror and curved beads being spoken of together further on as the sect xxxiii note in rendering the original wordnigi te here written phonetically but elsewhere with the characters the explanation given by tanigaha shisei and indeed suggested by the characters has been followed motowori view does not materially differ but he considers pacificatory or softening to be equivalent to soft applied to the offerings themselves which consisted of soft cloth the syllableteofnigi tebeing believed to be contraction oftahewhich signifies cloth the white cloth in ancient times was made of the paper mulberry broussonetia papyrifera and the blue of hemp the original word is written with the same character as theteofnigi tetranslated offerings above or in the singular grand liturgy or ritual ame no ta jikara wo no kami ame no uzume no mikoto the translator has followed the best authorities in rendering the obscure syllableuzuby the word alarming another interpretation quoted in tanigaha shisei perpetual commentary on the chronicles of japan and adopted by moribe in his idzu no chi waki is thatuzumeans head dress and that the goddess took her name from the head dress of spindle tree leaves which she wore the character with which the syllables in question here written phonetically are rendered ideographically in the chronicles signifies metal head gear flowers of gold or silver tasuki cord or sash passed over the shoulders round the back of the neck and attached to the wrists to strengthen the hands for the support of weights whence the name which means hand helper it was thus different both in form and use from the moderntasuki cord with its two ends joined which is worn behind the neck under thep arms and round the back to keep the modern loose sleeves out of the way when household duties are being performed satow making for herself head dress of spindle tree leaves the original of these words uke fusete is written phonetically and the exact meaning ofuke here rendered sounding board is open to doubt the parallel passage in the chronicles has the character which signifies trough manger or tub and the commentators seem therefore right in supposing that the meaning intended to be conveyed in both histories is that of some kind of improvised wooden structure used for the purpose of amplifying sound neither the text nor motowori commentary which hirata adopts word for word is absolutely explicit but the imitation and not the reality of divine possession appears to be here intended in the parallel passage of the chronicles on the other hand we seem to be reading of genuine possession the subject of the verb is not clear in many of the clauses of this immensely long sentence which does not properly hang together some clauses read as if the different deities who take part in the action did so of their own free will but the intention of the author must have been to let causative sense be understood throughout as he begins by telling us that plan was devised by the deity thought includer which plan must have influenced all the subsequent details shiri kume naha rope made of straw drawn up by the roots which stick out from the end of the rope straw ropes thus manufactured are still used in certain ceremonies and are calledshime naha corruption of the archaic term motowori explanation shows that this is more likely to be the proper signification of the word than back limiting rope shiri ho kagiri me naha which had been previously suggested by mabuchi with reference to its supposed origin at the time of the event narrated in this legend motowori plausibly conjectures the characterin the concluding words of this passage to be copyist error for and the translator has accordingly rendered it by the english word again as it stands the clause though making sense does not read like the composition of japanese next section xvii —the august expulsion of his impetuous male augustness the

tables and likewise cut his beard and even caused the nails of his fingers and toes to be pulled out and expelled him with divine expulsion again he begged food of the deity princess of great food then the princess of great food took out all sorts of dainty things from her nose her mouth and her fundament and made them up into all sorts of dishes which she offered to him but his swift impetuous male augustness watched her proceedings considered that she was offering up to him filth and at once killed the deity princess of great food so the things that were born in the body of the deity who had been killed were as follows in her head were born silkworms in her two eyes were born rice seeds in her two ears was born millet in her nose were born small beans in her private parts was born barley in her fundament were born large beans so his augustness the deity producing wondrous ancestor caused them to be taken and used as seeds an immense fine the student should consult motowori

this time some chopsticks came floating down the stream so his swift impetuous male augustness thinking that there must be people at the head waters of the river went up it in quest of them when he came upon an old man and an old woman —two of them —who had young girl between them and were weeping then he deigned to ask who are ye so the old man replied saying am an earthly deity child of the deity great mountain possessor am called by the name of foot stroking elder my wife is called by the name of hand stroking elder and my daughter is called by the name of wondrous inada princess again he asked what is the cause of your crying the old man answered saying had originally eight young girls as daughters but the eight forked serpent of koshi has come every year and devoured one and it is now its time to come wherefore we weep then he asked him what is its form like the old man answered saying its eyes are likeakakagachi it has one body with eight heads and eight tails moreover on its body grows moss and also chamaecyparis and cryptomerias its length extends over eight valleys and eight hills and if one look at its belly it is all constantly bloody and inflamed what is called hereakakagachiis the modernhohodzuki then his swift impetuous male augustness said to the old man if this be thy daughter wilt thou offer her to me he replied saying with reverence but know not thine august name then he replied saying am elder brother to the heaven shining great august deity so have now descended from heaven then the deities foot stroker elder and hand stroking elder said if that be so with reverence will we offer her to thee so his swift impetuous male augustness at once taking and changing the young girl into multitudinous and close toothed comb which he stuck into his august hair bunch said to the deities foot stroking elder and hand stroking elder do you distill some eight fold refined liquor also make fence round about in that fence make eight gates at each gate tie together eight platforms on each platform put liquor vat and into each vat pour the eight fold refined liquor and wait so as they waited after having thus prepared everything in accordance with his bidding the eight forked serpent came truly as the old man had said and immediately dipped head into each vat and drank the liquor thereupon it was intoxicated with drinking and all the heads lay down and slept then his swift impetuous male augustness drew the ten grasp sabre that was augustly girded on him and cut the serpent in pieces so that the river hi flowed on changed into river of blood so when he cut the middle tail the edge of his august sword broke then thinking it strange he thrust into and split the flesh with the point of his august sword and looked and there was great sword within so he took this great sword and thinking it strange thing he respectfully informed the heaven shining great august deity this is the herb quelling great sword written with the characters bird hairs but these must surely be phonetic in the chronicles the same name is written or hii the chief river in idzumo the name is supposed by some to have been derived from the name of the godhi hayabi see section viii note or in the singular chopstick literally had placed young girl between them similar construction to that in section xiii note the humble character servant is used by the old

words classified and explained which identifies the name ofkoshiwith the past tense of the verbkuru to come there is district kohori named koshi in the modern province of echigo but koshi was down to historical times somewhat vague designation of all the north western provinces —echizen kaga noto etchiū and echigo tradition preserved in the chronicles tells us that it was meant to denote the

should be mentioned that professor atkinson who like dr rein has studied the subject specially uses the word brewing but apparently no english term exactly represents the process which the liquor undergoes in the course of preparation curious question is suggested by the fact that the old japanese word for distilling or brewing liquor is homonymous with the verb to chew but there is not beyond this isolated verbal resemblance any documentary evidence in favour of the japanese ever having practised method of making liquor which still obtains in some of the south sea islands one account of

influenced by the parallel passage in the chronicles which says explicitly that the sword itself was sent up to the sun goddess reads the passage thus thinking it strange thing he sent it up with message to the heaven shining great august deity and mr satow follows him in thus translating see note to ritual vol ix pt ii of these transactions where the whole of this legend is translated with one or two slight verbal differences from the version here given in the opinion of the present writer hirata arguments in favour of the view here taken are conclusive see his sources of the ancient histories section lxxii in the second part of vol iii pp that the sword afterwards appears at the temple of the sun goddess in ise see end of section lxxxii by the high priestess of which it is bestowed on the legendary hero yamato take is not to the point in this connection as it is not necessary that all the parts of myth should be perfectly consistent kusa nagi no tachi for the

sought in the land of idzumo for place where he might build palace then he arrived at place called suga and said on coming to this place my august heart is pure —and in that place he built palace to dwell in so that place is now called suga when this great deity first built the palace of suga clouds rose up thence then he made an august song that song said eight clouds arise the eight fold fence

bestowed on him the name of master of the temple of inada eight eared deity of suga feel refreshed the japanese term used issuga sugashi whence the origin ascribed to the name of the place suga but move probably the name gave rise to this detail of the legend the real derivation of suga is unknown all the native commentators accepting the statement in the text and motowori supposing that up to the time of the deity arrival it had borne the name of inada we may perhaps conjecture some connection betweensugaandsusa no wo impetuous male see motowori commentary vol ix and it may be mentioned that the eight eared deity of suga is also mentioned as the eight eared deity of susa or began to build ode is another rendering of the japanese termuta which has been used by the present writer and by others utabeing however connected withutafu to sing it seems more consistent to translate it by the english word song or perhaps rather in that song he said this difficult song has been rather differently rendered by mr aston in the second appendix to his grammar of the japanese written language nd edition and again by mr satow in the note to his translation of the ritual already quoted mr aston premising that he follows motowori interpretation translates it thus many clouds arise the clouds which come forth are manifold fence for the husband and wife to retire withinthey have formed manifold fence oh that manifold fence mr satow translation is as follows many clouds arise the manifold fence of the forth issuing cloudsmakes manifold fencefor the spouses to be within oh that manifold fence in any case the meaning simply is that the multitudinous clouds rose up like fence or screen behind which the newly married deities might retire from public gaze and moribe suggests that the repetitions are an after addition made to bring up to the usual number of thirty one syllables what were originally but the three lines— tachi idzuru kumo motsuma gome niyo he gahi tsukuru yo

lx his reasons for always rendering the native word for eight ya by eight instead of by many or numerous as is done by the two eminent scholars above quoted with regard to the wordidzumowhich they in deference to the opinions of the native commentators render by clouds which come forth or forth issuing clouds the chinese characterswith which the word is written having that signification the present writer cannot persuade himself that such corruption asidzumoforide kumoeither retained at the time of the composition of the song or should now be credited with the signification which this its supposed etymology assigns to it the etymology moreover is far from being established and in this as in many other cases the chinese characters used to write the name of the province of idzumo may well have rested on nothing more than vague similarity of sound and probably no european scholar would endorse the opinion of the native commentators to whom the records are sacred book that the province of idzumo received its name from this very poem on the other hand we need have no difficulty in conceding that the pillow wordya kumo tatsu by which idzumo is preceded in poetical compositions did probably here originate —this song is in the chronicles only quoted in note for which reason some authorities dispute its antiquity in the note in question we find the reading gome the records have gomi the transitive form instead of the intransitive if this were adopted the translation would have to run thus the eight fold fence of idzumo makes an eight fold fence to shut up the spouse in and probably spouse should be understood in the feminine to mean wife obito written with the chinese character while the japanese word is probably derived fromoho bito great man when used as it often is as gentile name the translator renders it by grandee inada no miya nushi suga no ya tsui mimi no kami it should be stated that motowori as usual objects to the view thatmimisignifies ears its proper meaning in this name but he has no better explanation to offer and the chinese characters give usya tsu mimi eight ears the author of the tokiha gusa ingeniously

then as the sea water dried the skin of its body all split with the blowing of the wind so that it lay weeping with pain but the deity great name possessor who came last of all saw the hare and said why liest thou weeping the hare replied saying was in the island of oki and wished to cross over to this land but had no means of crossing over for this reason deceived the crocodiles of the sea saying let you and me compete and compute the numbers of our respective tribes so do you go and fetch every member of your tribe and make them all lie in row across from this island to cape keta then will tread on them and count them as run across hereby shall we know whether it or my tribe is the larger upon my speaking thus they were deceived and lay down in row and trod on them and counted them as came across and was just about to get on land when said you have been deceived by me as soon as had finished speaking the crocodile who lay the last of all seized me and stripped off all my clothing as was weeping and lamenting for this reason the eighty deities who went by before thee commanded and exhorted me saying bathe in the salt water and lie down exposed to the wind so on my doing as they had instructed me my whole body was hurt thereupon the deity great name possessor instructed the hare saying go quickly now to the river mouth wash thy body with the fresh water then take the pollen of the sedges growing at the river mouth spread it about and roll about upon it whereupon thy body will certainly be restored to its original state so the hare did as it was instructed and its body became as it had been originally this was the white hare of inaba it is now called the hare deity so the hare said to the deity great name possessor these eighty deities shall certainly not get the princess of yakami though thou bearest the bag thine augustness shall obtain her yakami hime the etymology is uncertain the name of province not far from that of idzumo the word may possibly as motowori suggests be derived fromina ba rice leaves kita no saki the etymology of the name seems uncertain the meaning of the wordketais the beams of roof the yards of sail but perhapsketaandketamay be nothing more than homonyms of independent origin not far from the coast of idzumo and of inaba see translator introduction xxxiii note literally to its original skin that is to say that its skin would again be covered with fur motowori and moribe agree in considering that the word white means bare in this place and the latter in his critique of the former commentary quotes examples which show that their view is probably correct next section xxii —mount tema the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com thereupon the princess of yakami answered the eighty deities saying will not listen to your words mean to marry the deity great name possessor so the eighty deities being enraged and wishing to slay the deity great name possessor took counsel together on arriving at the foot of tema in the land of hahaki and said to him on this mountain there is red boar so when we drive it down do thou wait and catch it if thou do not wait and catch it we will certainly slay thee having thus spoken they took fire and burnt large stone like unto boar and rolled it down then as they drove it down and he caught it he got stuck to and burnt by the stone and died thereupon her augustness his august parent cried and lamented and went up to heaven and entreated his divine producing wondrous augustness who at once sent princess cockle shell and prince clam to bring him to life then princess cockle shell triturated and scorched her shell and princess clam carried water and smeared him as with mother milk whereupon he became beautiful young man and wandered off hereupon the eighty deities seeing this again deceived him taking him with them into the mountains where they cut down large tree inserted wedge in the tree and made him stand in the middle whereupon they took away the wedge and tortured him to death then on her augustness his august parent again seeking him with cries she perceived him and at once cleaving the tree took him out and brought him to life and said to him if thou remain here thou wilt at last be destroyed by the eighty deities then she sent him swiftly off to the august place of the deity great house prince in the land of ki then when the eighty deities searched and pursued till they came up to him and fixed their arrows in their bows he escaped by clipping under the fork of tree and disappeared it must be understood that in the meantime they had arrived at her dwelling and begun to court her etymology unknown the text is here concise to obscurity but yet there ought not to be much doubt as

it copyist error for scorched or else to believe that in early time in japan the two characters were used interchangeably or nurse the meaning is that paste like milk was made of the triturated and calcined shell mixed with water there is in this passage play upon words which it is impossible to reproduce in english the japanese term for triturating kisage which the author has taken care to write phonetically resembling the name of princesskisa gahi cockle shell whileomo mother or nurse similarly recalls that of princessumugi clam motowori traces the names of the shell fish in question to this exploit of the two goddesses we shall be justified in applying an inverse interpretation to the legend the original of this clause or according to another reading etc is great crux to the native commentators who can make sure neither of the exact sense nor of the japanese reading of the first two characters which seem to be ideographic for three others occurring immediately below which are themselves of doubtful import an elaborate discussion of the question will be found in hirata exposition of the ancient histories vol xvii pp the general sense at all events is that here given the characters here rendered tortured him to death are by the modern commentators readuchi koroshiki which simply means killed him literally to her child oha ya biko no kami this deity is identified with the deityi dakerumentioned in the chronicle as son ofsusa no wo the impetuous male deity and as the introducer into the island of tsukushi in particular and into all the eight great islands of japan

of the province of ki is doubtless quite fanciful the land of tree later the characterwas replaced by which in sinico japanese has the same soundki while second one was added in order to conform to an edict of the empressgem miyō to the effect that all names of places were to be written with two chinese characters as was usual in china and korea the second character in this case simply carried on theisound with which the first ends so that the name becamekii next section xxiii —the nether distant land the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com the deity great house prince spoke to him saying thou must set off to the nether distant land where dwells his impetuous mate augustness that great deity will certainly counsel thee so on his obeying her command and arriving at the august place of his impetuous male augustness the latter daughter the forward princess came out and saw him and they exchanged glances and were married and she went in again and told her father saying very beautiful deity has come then the great deity went out and looked and said this is the ugly male deity of the reed plain and at once calling him in made him sleep in the snake house hereupon his wife her augustness the forward princess gave her husband snake scarf saying when the snakes are about to bite thee drive them away by waving this scarf thrice so on his doing as she had instructed the snakes became quiet so that he came forth after calm slumbers again on the night of the next day the impetuous male deity put him into the centipede and wasp house but as she again gave him centipede and wasp scarf and instructed him as before he came forth calmly again the impetuous male deity shot whizzing barb into the middle of large moor and sent him to fetch the arrow and when he had entered the moor at once set fire to the moor all round thereupon while he stood knowing no place of exit mouse came and said the inside is hollow hollow the outside is narrow narrow owing to its speaking thus he trod on the place where upon he fell in and hid himself during which time the fire burnt past then the mouse brought out in its mouth and presented to him the whizzing barb the feathers of the arrow were brought in their mouths by all the mouse children hereupon his wife the forward princess came bearing mourning implements and crying her father the great deity thinking that the deity great name possessor was already dead and done for went out and stood on the moor whereupon the deity great name possessor brought the arrow and presented it to him upon which the great deity taking him into the house and calling him into an eight foot spaced large room made him take the lice off his head so on looking at the head he saw that there were many centipedes there thereupon as his wife gave to her husband berries of themukutree and red earth he chewed the berries to pieces and spat them out with the red earth which he held in his mouth so that the great deity believed him to be chewing up and spitting out the centipedes and feeling fond of him in his heart fell asleep then the deity great name possessor grasping the great deity hair tied it fast to the various rafters of the house and blocking up the floor of the house with five hundred draught rock and taking his wife the forward princess on his back then carried off the great deity great life sword and life bow and arrows as also his heavenly speaking lute and ran out but the heavenly speaking lute brushed against tree and the earth resounded so the great deity who was sleeping started at the sound and pulled down the house but while he was disentangling his hair which was tied to the rafters the deity great name possessor fled long way so then pursuing after him to the even pass of hades and gazing on him from afar he called out to the deity great name possessor saying with the great life sword and the life bow and arrows which thou earnest pursue thy half brethren till they crouch on the august slopes of the passes and pursue them till they are swept into the reaches of the rivers and do thou wretch become the deity master of the great land and moreover becoming the deity spirit of the living land and making my daughter the forward princess thy consort do thou make stout the temple pillars at the foot of mount uka in the nethermost rock bottom and make high the cross beams to the plain of high heaven and dwell there thou villain so when bearing the great sword and bow he pursued and scattered the eighty deities he did pursue them till they crouched on the august slope of every pass he did pursue them till they were swept into every river and then he began to make the land quamobrem hera yamaki secundum anterius pactum cum eo in thalamo coivit so he brought her with him but fearing his consort the forward princess she stuck into the fork of tree the child that she had borne and went back so the child was called by the name of the tree fork deity and another name was the deity of august wells literally to the child the words placed in brackets and which are not to be found in either of the early printed editions are supplied in accordance with suggestion of moribe contained in his critique of motowori commentary motowori himself had supplied the words her augustness his august parent spoke to him which seem less appropriate it is true that one ms is quoted by motowori as favouring his view but such authority is insufficient and the mistake moreover peculiarly easy for copyist to make mi oyaforoho ya the palace this is motowori view of

legend master of the great land oho kuni nushi was not the original name of the deity commonly designated by it and his sovereignty over the land of the living whence the appropriateness of the second

elucidation —after giving his reasons for coming to woo the princess of nuna kaha the god declares that he is in such haste to penetrate to her chamber that he does not even stay to ungird his sword or take off his veil but tries to push or pull open the door at once during these vain endeavours the mountain side begins to re echo with the cries of the birds announcing the dawn when lovers must

strange and peculiar creature thewa kun shiworisays that it is bird much larger than pigeon and having loud and mournful cry it is likewise said to come out at night time and retire during the day for which reason doubtless mabuchi likens it to the owl very ancient and curious chinese book entitled the mountain and sea classic the modern editions of which contain extremely droll illustrations of fabulous creatures tells us of bird called the whitenuye which is like pheasant with markings on its head white wings and yellow feet and whose flesh is certain cure for the hiccough the characterand with which as well as withthe wordnuyeis variously written seem to be unauthorized—the line here following motowori and moribe view rendered would that could beat them till they were sick will also bear the interpretation formerly proposed by keichiyu would that could beat them till they left off —the last five lines here rendered oh swiftly flying heaven racing messenger etc are extremely obscure it is possible thatishi tafu ya rendered oh swiftly flying in deference to motowori and moribe view may be but meaninglessrefrain heaven racing messenger is tolerably certain of the rest it is not easy to make sense motowori proposes to credit the five lines in question with the following general meaning may this song like messenger run down to future ages preserving for them the tradition of this event moribe in his critique of motowori commentary supposes the lines in question to be an addition made by the official singers who in laterp times sang these songs as an accompaniment to dances whatever their origin and proper signification it is plain that they had come to be used as arefrain from which the first two lines were sometimes omitted as we see in some of the songs further on the drift of the poem is this being tender maiden my heart flutters like the birds on the sandy islets by the beach and cannot yet be thine yet do not die of despair for will soon comply with thy desires —the wordnuye kusa here rendered drooping plant in accordance with the views of the commentators is pillow word of somewhat obscure derivation —the wordchidori rendered dotterel throughout this translation denotes in its modern acceptation according to messrs blakiston and pryer any kind of sandpiper plover or dotterel its proper and original signification is however greatly debated by the commentators and some think that it is not the specific name of any kind of bird but stands simply by apocope fortachi dori rising bird thus designating any kind of small bird that rises and flies along near the beach —the wordna dori here in accordance with moribe view rendered gentle bird is taken by motowori to mean simply gentle compliant but both the construction and the context seem to impose on us the interpretation here given keichiyu in his kōgan shō interprets the whole passage differently but in order to do so he without sufficient authority changes the readings of the text intowa tori my bird andna tori thy bird —the refrain is the same as in the previous song there is no break in the text but the commentators rightly consider the following to be separate poem the import of this very plain spoken poem needs no elucidation —nubatama here rendered true jewels of the moor is the pillow word for things black or related to darkness the true jewels of the moor are supposed to be the jet black berries of thehiafugi pron hiōgi ixia chinensis the whole etymology is however not absolutely certain —of which of the two lovers the words coming radiant with smiles are spoken is not clear but they probably refer to the male deity as do the white arms strange though such an expression may appear as applied to man the goddess represents herself and her lover as using each other arms for pillows the word jewel arms means simply beautiful arms next section xxv —the cup pledge the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com again this deity chief empress her augustness the forward princess was very jealous so the deity her husband being distressed was about to go up from idzumo to the land of yamato and as he stood attired with one august hand on the saddle of his august horse and one august foot in the august stirrup he sang saying when take and attire myself so carefully in my august garments black as the true jewels of the moor and like the birds of the offing look at my breast —though raise my fins say that these are not good and cast them off on the waves on the beach when take and attire myself so carefully in my august garments green as the kingfisher and like the birds of the oiling look at my breast —though raise my fins say that these too are not good and cast them off on the waves on the beach when take and attire myself so carefully in my raiment dyed in the sap of the dye tree the pounded madder sought in the mountain fields and like the birds of the offing look at my breast —though raise my fins say that they are good my dear young sister thine augustness though thou say that thou wilt not weep —if like the flocking birds flock and depart if like the led birds am led away and depart thou wilt hang down thy head likep single eulalia upon the mountain and thy weeping shall indeed rise as the mist of the morning shower thine augustness my spouse like the young herbs the tradition of the thing too this then his empress taking great august liquor cup and drawing near and offering it to him sang saying oh thine augustness the deity of eight thousand spears thou my dear master of the great land indeed being man probably hast on the various island headlands that thou seest and on every beach headland that thou lookest on wife like the young herbs but as for me alas being woman have no man except thee have no spouse except thee beneath the fluttering of the ornamented fence beneath the softness of the warm coverlet beneath the rustling of the cloth coverlet thine arms white as rope of paper mulberry bark softly patting my breast soft as the melting snow and patting each other interlaced stretching out and pillowing our selves on each others arms —true jewel arms and with outstretched legs will we sleep lift up the luxuriant august liquor she having thus sung they at once pledged each other by the cup with their hands on each other necks and are at rest till the present time these are called divine words chief wife the meaning of this poem is start for yamato there to search for better wife and carefully array myself for the journey black —the colour of mourning —is not fair enough and red is more beautiful than green so it is on my red garments that my choice rests and thou jealous and imperious woman for all that thou sayest that thou wilt not heed my going thou wilt weep when depart with my retainers as departs flock of birds and thou wilt bury thy head in thy hands and thy tears shall be as the misty drops of the morning shower —the wordshata tagi rendered in accordance

transcription we should get the more satisfactory readingha tataki beat my wings but the syllable in question does not seem to be anywhere so written —the madder is in the originalakane here written but doubtless only through the error of some copyist atane the words rendered sought in the mountain fields might also be translated sown in the mountain fields magashi sought andmakishi sowed being thought to be convertible —the words my beloved represent the japaneseitokoya no whose meaning is obscure and much disputed —the words when am led away must be understood as if they were active instead of passive signifying as they do when lead away my retinue of followers —the eulalia eulalia japonica is long king of grass very often alluded to in the later classical poetry —the words on the mountain represent the japanese wordsyama to no in accordance with motowori and hirata view of the meaning of the latter or th primá facieinterpretation of in the province of yamato which keichiyu adopts will not bear investigation —it is not quite clear whether the mist of the morning shower means mist separate from the rain or is simply phrase for the rain drops themselves motowori adopts the former opinion young herbs waka kusa is the pillow word for spouse —newly married youths and maidens being likened to the fresh grown grass therefrainis an abbreviated form of that found in the two previous poems the import of this poem needs little explanation —the goddess says to her husband come back and live with me and quaff this goblet as sign of reconciliation for though thou as man mayest have wife on every shore shall be left solitary if thou depart —p the ornamented fence is supposed to mean curtain round the sleeping place —the latter part to the poem excepting the concluding phrase is repetition of lines that have already occurred in the last one of sect xxiv note the wordtate matsurase here rendered lift up occasions some difficulty it properly signifies present to superior but here it must be taken to mean partake of as the goddess is speaking to her spouse himself unless indeed we suppose the final words of the song to be command addressed to one of her attendants to present the cup to their common lord and master this is the probable and generally accepted meaning of the original of this clause which is written phonetically explained by moribe to mean with reference to the whole story conversation about divine events motowori proposes to supplement the character song to the two in the text and to take the three together as designating the nature of the preceding songs in accordance with the usage in other cases rustic songs courtier songs etc if this view were adopted we should have to translate by divine converse songs next section

says that it is with hesitation that he proposes many of his interpretations and it is with still greater hesitation that the translator has accepted them next section xxvii —the little prince the renowned deity the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com so when the deity master of the great land dwelt at the august cape of miho in idzumo there came riding on the crest of the waves in boat of heavenlykagami deity dressed in skins of geese flayed with complete flaying who when asked his name replied not moreover the deities who accompanied him though asked all said that they knew not then the toad spoke saying as for this the crumbling prince will surely know it thereupon the deity master of the great land summoned and asked the crumbling prince who replied saying this is the little prince the renowned deity the august child of the deity producing wondrous deity so on their then respectfully informing his augustness the deity producing wondrous august ancestor he replied saying this is truly my child he among my children is the child who dipped between the fork of my hand so do he and thou become brethren and make and consolidate this land so from that time forward the two deities the great name possessor and the little prince the renowned deity made and consolidated this land conjointly but afterwards the little prince the renowned deity crossed over to the eternal land so the deity here called the crumbling prince who revealed the little prince the renowned deity is what is now called the scarecrow in the mountain fields this deity though his legs do not walk is deity who knows everything in the empire not to be confounded with the better known miho in suruga derivation of the name seems uncertain the character used is which properly denotes an ear of rice or other grain what plant the author intends by this name is not quite certain the charactersandare variously used to write it in the native work of reference where also we learn that it probably corresponds to the plant known in different provinces of modern japan aschichi gusa tombo no chichi kagarahiandgaga imo we may best understand theampelopsis serianæfoliato have been intended as the plant is described as having berry three or four inches long shaped like towel gourd hechima so that if scooped out it would fairly resemble boat in miniature all the authorities are agreed in considering the character goose to be copyist error but there is no agreement as to the character which should be substituted for it hirata reads wren changing the phonetic wren also is the reading in one account of the chronicles and moribe commenting thereon in his idzu no chi waki thinks that wren must have been the bird originally intended by the framers of the tradition motowori following suggestion of the editor of prefers to consider the radical for bird to have been put by mistake for the radical for insect and readswhich signifies moth especially the silkworm moth motowori however proceeds to give to the character in question the japanese reading ofhi mushi lit fire insect ephemera which is not warranted the proper japanese reading ishihiru the best would seem to be to adopt the reading moth the original word istani guku its derivation and the name of the species which it denoted are alike unknown indeed we might equally well translate by frog kuye biko the interpretation of the name here adopted is motowori tominobu takeskuyeto be the name of place and the parsonage in question to have been the inventor of scarecrows whence the tradition connected with his name sukuna biko na no kami or without thenigori sukuna hiko na no kami the interpretation of the name here followed is that proposed by motowori but not followed by hirata and moribe who prefer to consider it antithetical to that ofoho na muji the great name possess or first mentioned in sect note immediately below his name is given in the lengthened form motowori who strange to say is followed by hirata —conf sect xviii note interprets the two characters here in accordancep with general usage taken to signify respectfully informed as informed and took up thus making it appear that the diminutive deity was personally taken up to heaven surely recollection of the parallel passage in the chronicles which says that messenger was sent up to inform the heavenly deities should have preserved the commentators from thus offending against both grammar and common sense slipped away between my fingers in the legend as given in the chronicles the father explains more particularly that the little prince the renowned deity had been bad boy who ran away for an explanation of this expression see sect xxiii note toko yo no kuai some kind of paradise or hades is meant as is proved by innumerable references in the early literature of japan and we may suppose the idea to have been borrowed from the chinese or through them from buddhism and to have been afterwards vaguely located in some distant country in sect lxxiv we are told of the orange having been brought from the eternal land by tajima mori who is said to have been of korean extraction korea which is to the west of japan and the buddhist paradise in the west might well he confounded by tradition though it is equally open to discussion whether southern china or even the loochoo islands might not have been thus vaguely designated in any case it was distant place imperfectly known though specifically named in the chronicles tajima mori is made to say that it is the retreat of gods and fairies and not to be reached by common men —motowori immense note on this word see vol xxi pp of his commentary is specimen of the specious arguments by which he endeavours to ward off from the early japanese the imputation of ever having borrowed any ideas from their neighbours he would have us believe thattoko yois derived fromsoko yori thence and that the name simply denotes foreign countries in general this is on par with the opinion emitted by arawi hakuseki in his ko shi tsū to the effect that the eternal land was simply place in the province of hitachi the latter good old commentator apparently founded himself on no better reasons than his general rejection of supernatural or otherwise perplexing details and the fact that one of the characters with which the name of the province in question written is which also forms part of the name oftoko yo no kuni literally everything beneath heaven beneath heaven all that is beneath the heavens is common chinese phrase for the chinese empire which was in ancient days not unnaturallyp supposed by its inhabitants to form the whole civilized world the expression was borrowed by the japanese to designate their own country but its use by them had not the same plea of ignorance of other civilized lands as they were acquainted with china and korea and had hence obtained nearly all the arts of life next section xxviii —the august luck

eastern mountain top this is the deity who dwells on the top of mount mimoro in the chronicles this is given as the designation of the deity who came over the sea and motowori therefore adopts it as the heading of this section for an explanation of this expression see sect xxiii note if thou wilt build me temple the original might also be rendered if thou wilt worship before me or at my shrine of

error foror and to interpret the clause thus the deity who was changed into an arrow is also worthy of notice but further suggestion of his to readforand to interpret thus the deity of the red arrow

allude to the length of the well grown rice kuku ki waka muro tsunane no kami motowori supposes this god to have been the protector of houses and interprets the name to denote the beams and the ropes with which the beams were bound together the word here readtsuna rope is written with the character and might perhaps be rendered pueraria but as in early times the tendrils of such creeping plants formed the only substitute for rope the two renderings come to have very nearly the same signification the name is here abbreviated in the original towaka muro tsuna ne no kami next section xxx —the august deliberation for pacifying the land the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com the heaven shining great august deity commanded saying the luxuriant reed plains the land

having thus deigned to charge him she sent him down from heaven hereupon his augustness heavenly great great ears standing on the floating bridge of heaven said the luxuriant reed plains the land of fresh rice ears of thousand autumns —of long five hundred autumns is painfully uproarious —it is with this announcement he immediately re ascended and informed the heaven shining great august deity then the high august producing wondrous deity and the heaven shining great august deity commanded the eight hundred myriad deities to assemble in divine assembly in the bed of the tranquil river of heaven and caused the deity thought includer to think of plan and said this central land of reed plains is the land with which we have deigned to charge our august child as the land which he shall govern so as he deems that violent and savage earthly deities are numerous in this land which deity shall we send to subdue them then the deity thought includer and likewise the eight hundred myriad deities took counsel and said the deity ame no ho hi is the one that should be sent so they sent the deity ame no ho hi but he at once curried favour with the deity master of the great land and for three years brought back no report toyo ashi hara no chi aki no naga ho aki no midzu ho izo kuni freely rendered ever fruitful japan with its reed covered plains and its luxuriant rice fields see sect

ruler of heaven see sect xiii note see sect xvi note the meaning must be as motowori suggests that the story was told first and the deity thought includer asked for his advice after he had heard it see sect note see sect xiii note next section xxxi —the heavenly young prince the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com therefore the high august producing wondrous deity and the heaven shining great august deity again asked all the deities saying the deity ame no ho hi whom we sent down to the central land of reed plains is long of bringing back report which deity were it best to send on fresh mission then the deity thought includer replied saying the heavenly young prince son of the deity heaven earth spirit should be sent so they bestowed on him the heavenly feathered arrows and sent him thereupon the heavenly young prince descending to that land at once wedded princess under shining daughter of the deity master of the great land and moreover planning how he might gain possession of the land for eight years brought back no report so then the high august producing wondrous deity and the heaven shining great august deity again asked all the deities saying the heavenly young prince is long of bringing back report which deity shall we send on fresh mission to enquire the cause of the heavenly young prince long tarrying thereupon all the deities and likewise the deity thought includer replied saying the pheasant the name crying female should be sent upon which the high august producing wondrous deity and the heaven shining great august deity charged the pheasant saying what thou shalt go and ask the heavenly young prince is this the reason for which thou wast sent to the central land of reed plains was to subdue and pacify the savage deities of that land why for eight years bringest thou back no report so then the crying female descending from heaven and perching on the multitudinous ly branching cassia tree at the heavenly young prince gate told him everything according to the mandate of the heavenly deities then the heavenly spying woman having heard the bird words spoke to the heavenly young prince saying the sound of this bird cry is very bad so thou shouldest shoot it to earth on her thus urging him the heavenly young prince at once took the heavenly vegetable wax tree bow and the heavenly deer arrows bestowed on him by the heavenly deities and shot the pheasant to death then the arrow being shot up upside down through the pheasant breast reached the august place where the heaven shining great august deity and the high integrating deity were sitting in the bed of the tranquil river of heaven this high integrating deity is another name for the high august producing wondrous deity so on the high integrating deity taking up the arrow and looking at it he saw that there was blood adhering to the feathers of the arrow thereupon the high integrating deity saying this arrow is the arrow that was bestowed on the heavenly young prince showed it to all the deities and said if this be an arrow shot at the evil deities by the heavenly young prince in obedience to our command let it not hit him if he has foul heart let the heavenly young prince perish by this arrow with these words the took the arrow and thrust it back down through the arrow hole so that it hit the heavenly young prince on the top of his breast as he was sleeping on his couch so that he died this is the origin of the saying beware of returning arrow moreover the pheasant returned not so this is the origin of the modern proverb which speaks of the pheasant as sole messenger so the sound of the wailings of the heavenly young prince wife princess under shining re echoing in the wind reached heaven so the heavenly young prince father the deity heaven earth spirit and his wife and children who were in heaven hearing it came down with cries and lamentations and at once built mourning house there and made the wild goose of the river the head hanging bearer the heron the broom bearer the kingfisher the person of the august food the sparrow the pounding woman the pheasant the weeping woman and having thus arranged matters they disported themselves for eight days and eight nights at this time the deity ajishiki taka hiko ne came and condoled on the mourning for the heavenly young prince whereupon the heavenly young prince father and wife who had come down from heaven bewailed themselves saying my child is not dead no my lord is not dead no and with these words clung to his hands and feet and bewailed themselves and lamented the cause of their mistake was that the two deities closely resembled each other in countenance so therefore they made the mistake thereupon the deity ajishi ki taka hiko ne was very angry and said it was only because he was my dear friend that came to condole why should be likened to an unclean dead person —and with these words he drew the ten grasp sabre that was augustly girded on him and cut down the mourning house and kicked away the pieces with his feet this was on what is called mount mourning at the source of the river awimi in the land of minu the great sword with which he cut paragraph continues the mourning house to pieces was called by the name of great blade mower another name by which it was called being the divine keen sabre so when the deity aji shiki toba hiko ne flew away in his anger his younger sister her augustness the high princess in order to reveal his august name sang saying oh ’tis the deity aji shiki taka hiko ne traversing two august valleys with the refulgence of august assembled hole jewels of the august assembled jewels worn round her neck by the weaving maiden in heaven this song is of rustic style literally long brings back no report literally to send again the same expression occurs below ame waka hiko all the commentators agree that it is in order to express disapprobation of this god wickedness that the title of deity or augustness is never coupled with his name ame tsu kuni tama no kami ame no koko yumiandame no haha ya in sect xxxiv these weapons are mentioned under the slightly altered names ofama no hazhi yumi heavenly vegetable wax tree bow andama no kaku ya heavenly deer arrows large bow made of vegetable wax tree rhus succedanea wood and arrows with broad feathers are supposed to be intended shita teru hime see sect xxvi note oho kuni nushi no kami see sect xx note literally long brings back no report na naki me if the view here taken of the meaning of the japanese expression be correct it is that preferred by motowori and hirata the pheasant would seem to have been supposed to cry out its own name —in archaic japanesekigishi the syllablesna naki me however lend themselves equally well to the interpretation of nameless female and are in the chronicles found written with characters having that signification another reasonable opinion is that the name should be connected with the tradition mentioned further on of thep pheasant having been the mourner lit crying female naki me at the funeral of the heavenly young prince in this case the wordna name would have to be considered redundant and it will be observed that the next time the name is mentioned we find simplynaki me crying female without the syllable in question katsura no ki variously written and phonetically though it is not absolutely certain what tree is intended the weight of authority and of probability is in favour of its being the cassia which plays part in chinese mythology in modern parlance thekatsurais tree whose latin name iscercidiphyllum japonicum ama no sagu me this expression as motowori explains signifies only that as the arrow was shot from below straight up at pheasant perching on branch overhead the feathers which are properly considered to form the top part of the arrow were naturally underneath taka gi no kami the name is written with the characters which taken ideographically would give us in english high tree deity but the translator has little doubt but that motowori is correct inconsideringto be here used phonetically and the syllablegi which it represents to be contraction ofguhi forkuhi itself derived fromkumu and best rendered by the verb to integrate in japanesemagare lit turn aside become crooked come to bad end through the hole in the bottom of the sky through which the arrow had entered or which the arrow had made for itself literally high breast hill the sentence placed between brackets is supposed by motowori to be an addition to the text made by some copyist who had in his mind the parallel passage of the chronicles in the records of ancient matters revised the two characters answering to our word beware are omitted and the resulting meaning is this was the origin of the practice of sending back arrows of shooting an enemy with the arrow he had himself just used the import of the proverb seems to be that an embassy should always consist of more than one person this is motowori view based on his interpretation of the characterashita which he identifies withhito one and it agrees well with the story in the text hirata who in his exposition of the ancient histories following the versionp of the legend given in the chronicles narrates two pheasant embassies —the male bird being sent first and as it did not return the female afterwards —takes the character in the proper sense belonging to it in chinese and interprets the words of the proverb to mean the pheasant hurried embassy the wife and children of the heavenly young prince who had been left behind by him in heaven when he went on his embassy to idzumo in the place where he died the mourning house was used to keep the corpse in till it was finally buried some of the commentators believe this bird to be separate species and moribe who says that he saw one at the estuary near kuhana in ise describes it as rather slenderer than an ordinary wild goose with longer legs and higher back if we accepted this the better english translation would be river wild goose the original of this expression kisari mochi is very obscure even in the chronicles by whose ideographic reading the translator has been guided and being here written phonetically becomes more conjectural still the most likely opinion is that it signifies one bearing on his head the food to be offered to the corpse though if this view be adopted the office of the mourner in question may seem to resemble too closely that of the kingfisher the latter has however been supposed to have brought fish while the goose may have brought rice another proposal is that the goose brought the food and the kingfisher cooked it while the sparrow as mentioned below performed the intermediate operation of pounding the rice see motowori elaborate note on this word in vol xiii pp of his commentary or simply the pounder the parallel passage of the chronicles tells us that they wept and wailed and sang for eight days and eight nights see sect xxvi note he was brother to the heavenly young prince wife the author of the perpetual commentary on the chronicles of japan tells us that these tears were tears of joy doubtless such is the meaning of the text yet the repetition of the words bewailing and lamenting is curious see sect viii note mo yama no such mountain is now known awimi gaha no such river is now known according to the characters with which it is written the name signifies knot grass seeing river afterwards called mino this province probably received its name as the author of the explanation of japanese names suggests frommi nu three moors from the large moors of kagami awo and seki ga hara which it contains the modern commentators prefer to derive it from ma nu true moor oho ha hari the name might also be rendered great leaf mower the translator has followed hirata in omitting thenigorifrom the syllableka kamudo tsurugi the meaning of the song is oh this isaji shihi taka hiko ne whose refulgence similar to that of the jewels worn by the weaving maiden in heaven shines afar across hills and valleys —the translator does not follow those commentators who emendana dama hole jewels toaka dama red resplendent jewels as the frequent reference in this and the other ancient books to the string on which beads were strung and the presence in ancient tombs etc of numbers of such beads with holes drilled through them they are now known by the name ofkuda dama tube jewels renders such an emendation unnecessary the weaving maiden in heaven is evidently notwithstanding motowori endeavour to disprove the fact the chinesechih nü personification of lyrae to whom there are countless allusions in chinese literature and who also became frequent theme of the later japanese poets or barbarous style motowori endeavours to explain away the various names of styles of songs found in the early literature by asserting that they are simply derived from the initial words of the song in question and that for instance in the present case the title of rustic song was bestowed on the poem only because in the chronicles it is coupled with another which lends itself to such an interpretation moribe gives his sanction to this view but though it is difficult to explain many of the titles on any other theory the translator thinks that it cannot be accepted as generally satisfactory in the face of the numerous cases which contradict it and of which its supporters can give no satisfactory explanation the whole subject of the titles of the manner of singing etc of the ancient poems is indeed involved in obscurity next section xxxii —abdication of the deity master of the great land the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com hereupon the heaven shining great august deity said which deity were it best to send on fresh mission then the deity thought includer and likewise all the deities said he who is named the deity majestic point blade extended and dwells in the heavenly rock dwelling by the source of the tranquil river of heaven is the one that should be sent or if not this deity then this deity child the brave awful possessing male deity might be sent moreover owing to this deity heavenly point blade extended having blocked up and turned back the waters of the tranquil river of heaven and to his dwelling with the road blocked up other deities cannot go thither so the heavenly deer deity should be sent specially to ask him so then the heavenly deer deity was sent to ask the deity heaven point blade extended who replied saying will obey and will respectfully serve you nevertheless on this errand ye should send my child the brave awful possessing male deity and with these words immediately offered his son to heaven shining great august deity so the deity heavenly bird boat was attached to the brave awful possessing male deity and they were sent off therefore these two deities descending to the little shore of inasa in the land of idzumo drew their swords ten hand breadths long stuck them upside down on the crest of wave seated themselves cross legged on the points of the swords and asked the deity master of the great land saying the heaven shining great august deity and the high integrating deity have charged us and sent us to ask saying we have deigned to charge our august child with thy dominion the central land of reed plains as the land which he should govern so how is thy heart he replied saying am unable to say my child the deity eight fold thing sign master will be the one to tell you but he is gone to cape miho to pursue birds and catch fish and has not yet returned so then the deity bird boat was sent to summon the deity eight fold thing sign master who on being graciously asked spoke to the great deity his father saying will obey do thou respectfully present this land to the august child of the heavenly deity —and thereupon he trod on the edge of his boat so as to capsize it clapped his heavenly departing hands in the fence of green branches and disappeared so then they asked the deity master of the great land saying thy son the deity thing sign master has now spoken thus hast thou other sons who should speak hereupon he spoke again saying there is my other son the deity brave august name firm there is none beside him while he was thus speaking the deity brave august name firm came up bearing on the tips of his fingers thousand draught rock and said who is it that has come to our land and thus secretly talks if that be so should like to have trial of strength so should like to begin by taking thine august hand so on his letting him take his august hand his touch at once turned it into an icicle and again his touch turned it into sword blade so then he was frightened and drew back then on the brave awful possessing male deity wishing to take the hand of the deity paragraph continues brave august name firm and asking permission to take it in return he grasped and crushed it as if it were taking young reed and cast it aside upon which the deity brave august name firm fled away so when the brave awful possessing male deity pursuing after him came up with him at the sea of suha in the land of shinanu and was about to slay him the deity brave august name firm said will obey slay me not will go to no other place but this neither will go against the command of my father the deity master of the great land will not go against the words of the deity eight fold thing sign master will yield up this central land of reed plains according to the command of the august child of the heavenly deities so they returned again and asked the deity master of the great land saying thy children the two deities the deity thing sign master and the deity brave august name firm have said that they will follow and not go against the commands of the august child of the heavenly deities so how is thy heart then he replied saying according as the two deities my children have said too will not go against them in accordance with the heavenly command will at once yield up this central land of reed plains but as to my place of

done in japan large space of shallow water had been fenced in with posts and stuck over with branches ofp trees single opening being left for fish to enter by —then clapped his hands in token of departure and sank to the bottom —this is hirata interpretation of the passage which is difficult one and is differently understood by motowori whom mr satow has followed in one of his notes to the rituals see vol vii pt ii of these transactions rendering it thus he then trod upon the edge of his boat so as to overturn it and with his hands crossed back to back in token of consent transformed his boat into green fence of branches and disappeared careful comparison of the remarks in motowori commentary vol xiv pp with those in hirata exposition of the ancient histories vol xxii pp and with the text itself as also with the text of the parallel passage in the chronicles has however left no doubt in the mind of the translator that hirata view is the correct one take mi gata no kami the interpretation of the name is that proposed by motowori rock which it would take thousand men to lift this expression seems here as motowori says to be used in the sense of come on it has survived in the modern wordsaraba which sometimes has that meaning the brave awful male deity hand turned first into an icicle and next into sword blade on being touched by the deity brave august name firm to the alarm and hurt of the latter the lake of suha no satisfactory etymology of the name is forthcoming in later times calledshinano the usual derivation of the word is that which connects it withshina zaka mountainous ascents —an appropriate enough name for the province in question it is however more probably derived fromshina the name of tree resembling the lime tilia cordata andnuorno moor if ye will build me temple founded on the nethermost rocks and reaching up to heaven like unto the august residence of the heavenly deity who is coming to replace me as sovereign upon earth will vanish to hades and serve him there and as for the gods my children none of them will rebel against their new lord if the deity thing sign master be accepted as the protector of his escort —some of the expressions in the original stand in need of explanation su here rendered nest in accordance with the characteremployed in writing it may mean lattice and refer to the lattice work over the holep in the chimney of the roof the succession of heaven sun in japaneseama tsu hi tsugi means the inheritance of the sovereignty of japan or of idzumo momotaradzu less than hundred is the pillow word forya se eighty and for some other words it must he disregarded in making sense of any sentence in which it occurs the eighty road windings signify says motowori an immensely long way and are here meant for the long road leading to hades or for hades itself conf sect xcvi note in rendering the last sentence of the passage that commencing again as for my children etc which is particularly vague the translator has been guided by motowori opinion which seems the most satisfactory one it must be understood that the deities whose rear and van the deity thing sign master is to become are those who are about to escort the new sovereign down from heaven disappeared the passage placed within brackets is supplied by motowori to fill up an evident omission in the text literally little shore see note to this section the derivation oftagishiis doubtful butconf sect lxxix note motowori remarks that we seem to have here the old name of the place now known only on account of the temple which it contains askidzuki no oho yashiro the pestle hardened great shrine kushi ya tama no kami motowori proposes to considertamaas contraction oftamuke offering and to take the name to signify the deity of wondrous increasing offerings hirata interpretation which is followed in the translation seems better as the term eight spirits or eight fold spirit accords with the religious role attributed to this deity without necessitating any hazardous philological conjectures the actual character used to write the disputed word is jewel see sect vi note the word when must be understood presumptively as signifying that the way in which he carried out his task was by turning into cormorant making platters etc it is uncertain whether the wordme here rendered seaweed is general designation or the name of the particular species supposed to be the same as or similar to the modernhondahara halochola macrantha kamu musu bi mi oya no kami the translator has followed moribe in the interpretation of the first part and hirata in the interpretation of the latter part of this extremely difficult passage which is crux to all the commentators butp whose general sense at least is this will continue drilling fire for the god kitchen until the soot hangs down from the roof of the temple of the ancestral deity in heaven above and until the earth below is baked down to its nethermost rocks and with the fire thus drilled will cook for him the fish brought in by the fishermen and present them to him in baskets woven of split bamboos which will bend beneath their weight —another plausible interpretation of the original expression rendered by these last two words is that they are simply the pillow word fortowowo towowo ni bending the rope with which the fishermen are supposed to have angled is described in detail by hirata exposition of the ancient histories vol xxiv as long rope from which other strings each with hook attached depended and is said by him to be still in use in the provinces of shimofusa shimōsa and hitachi the lattice of the gable must be understood to mean bamboo lattice covering hole beneath the gable which served as chimney motowori remarks on this passage will be found in vol xiv pp of his commentary and moribe on the wordsto daru ama no nihi su rendered on the heavenly new lattice of the gable in his examination of difficult words vol ii pp the latter especially are well worth perusal by the student mr satow in one of the notes to his translation of the rituals see vol ix pt ii of these transactions gives somewhat divergent rendering of this passage following as he does the interpretation given by motowori it is as follows the fire which have drilled will burn until the soot of the rich and sufficing heavenly new nest of the parent kami musubi in heaven hangs down many hand breadths long and the earth below will bake down to its bottom most rocks and stretching thousand fathoms of paper mulberry rope will draw together and bring ashore the fisherman large mouthed small finnedsuzuki and will offer up the heavenly fish food on bending split bamboos next section xxxiii —the august descent from heaven of his augustness the august grandchild the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com then the heaven shining great august deity and the high integrity deity commanded and charged the heir apparent his augustness truly conqueror conquer swift heavenly great great ears paragraph continues saying the brave awful possessing male deity says that he has now finished pacifying the central land of reed plains so do thou in accordance with our gracious charge descend to and dwell in and rule over it then the heir apparent his augustness truly conqueror conquer conquering swift heavenly great ears replied saying while have been getting ready to descend there has been born to me child whose name is his august ness heaven plenty earth plenty heaven sun height prince rice ear ruddy plenty this child should be sent down as for this august child he was augustly joined to her augustness myriad looms luxuriant dragon fly island princess daughter of the high integrating deity and begot children his augustness heavenly rice ear ruddy and next his augustness prince rice ear ruddy plenty therefore in accordance with these words they laid their command on his augustness prince rice ear ruddy plenty deigning to charge him with these words this luxuriant reed plain land of fresh rice ears is the land over which thou shalt rule so he replied will descend from heaven according to your commands so when his augustness prince rice ear ruddy plenty was about to descend from heaven there was at the eight forking road of heaven deity whose refulgence reached upwards to the plain of high heaven and downwards to the central land of reed plains so then the heaven shining great august deity and the high integrating deity commanded and charged the heavenly alarming female deity saying though thou art but delicate female thou art deity who conquers in facing deities so be thou the one to go and ask thus this being the road by which our august child is about to descend from heaven who is it that is thus there so to this gracious question he replied saying am an earthly deity named the deity prince of saruta the reason for my coming here is that having heard of the intended descent of the august child of the heavenly deities have come humbly to meet him and respectfully offer myself as his augustness vanguard then joining to him his augustness heavenly beckoning ancestor lord his augustness grand jewel her augustness heavenly alarming female her augustness shi ko ri do me and his augustness jewel ancestor in all five chiefs of companies they sent him down from heaven thereupon they joined to him the eight foot long curved jewels and mirror that had allured the heaven shining great august deity from the rock dwelling and also the herb quelling great sword and likewise the deity thought includer the hand strength male deity and the deity heavenly rock door opener of eternal night and charged him thus regard this mirror exactly as if it were our august spirit and reverence it as if reverencing us next did they say let the deity thought includer take in hand our affairs and carry on the government these two deities are worshipped at the temple of isuzu the next the deity of luxuriant food is the deity dwelling in the outer temple of watarahi the next the deity heavenly rock door opener another name for whom is the wondrous rock true gate deity and another name for whom is the luxuriant rock true gate deity —this deity of the august gate the next the deity hand strength male dwells in sanagata now his augustness the heavenly beckoning ancestor lord is the ancestor of the nakatomi chieftains his augustness grand jewel is the ancestor of the imibe headmen her augustness the heavenly alarming female is the ancestress of the duchesses of saru her augustness shi ko ri do me is the ancestress of the mirror making chieftains his augustness jewel ancestor is the ancestor of the jewel ancestor chieftains taka no kami see sect xxxi note it will be remembered that this god was son of the sun goddess or of her brothersusa no wo the impetuous male —see sect xii note and also the first two sentences of sect xiv and the first sentence of sect xv the characters rendered heir apparent are which form the usual chinese equivalent of that term and were borrowed by the japanese motowori reading of them ashi tsugi no miko prince of the sun succession has no authority but his own patriotic fancy for this tremendous name see sect xiii note the humble character servant is used for the first personal pronoun ame nigishi kuni nigishi ama tsu hi daka hiko ho no ni nigi no mi koto excepting as regards the finalgiofni nigi which it is surely better with hirata to consider as helping to form the wordnigi plenty than to take it as separate word signifying lord as motowori does the translation follows motowori interpretation of the various component parts of this tremendous name which is mostly abbreviated to its latter portion it is precisely to this latter portion the syllableshiko ho no nigi that considerable doubt attaches homight mean fire rather than rice ears and motowori himself suggests thatni nigishould perhaps be regarded as corruption ofnigi kahi plentiful spikes of grain rather than as ruddy plenty about the meaning of the rest of the name there cannot be much doubt heaven sun height must be under stood as an honorific designation signifying high as the sun in heaven the translator puts this sentence between brackets because it is an evident interruption of the main story indeed the edition of prints it as note to the text the grammar of it is curious as on firstp reading one would be tempted to suppose that this child his augustame nigishi kuni nigishi amatsu hi doka hiko ho no ni nigi was the father ofhiko ho no ni nigi but the latter name is but an abbreviated form of the former and the god could not be his own father the meaning rather is and such construction is not so forced in japanese as it sounds in english as for the parentage of this child he was born of the marriage of his augustness truly conqueror etc with her augustness myriad looms etc princess there is however real confusion in the traditional genealogy as the chronicles make the deity in question father to his augustness heavenly rice ear ruddy instead of younger brother viz his augustness truly conqueror etc yorodzu hata toyo aki dzu shi hime no mikoto mabuchi as quoted by motowori suggests thatyorodzu myriad should be connected with the wordyoroshi good as signifying an extreme degree thene plus ultra but though perhaps good guess at the origin in the word it need not affect our estimate of its actual signification the translator has however followed mabuchi in considering the syllableshias an apocopated form ofshima island andaki dzu shi ma as having its usual signification of dragon fly island more literally island of the autumn insect rather than accept motowori explanation ofshias representing the verbchijimu to be puckered and of the whole compoundaki dzu shias signifying crape like dragon flies wings not only is there no mention of crape in other passages of these records but the derivation does not to say the least recommend itself onphilologicalgrounds ame no ho akari no mikoto the word rendered ripe will bear equally well the interpretation red hiko ho no ni nigi the abbreviated form of the name in note toyo ashi hara no midzu hono kuni this periphrastic synonym of japan has appeared under slightly shorter form in sect ix note ame no udzu me no kami the goddess whose loud bold merriment was the chief cause of the sun goddess emerging from her retreat in the cavern see sect xvi note the brazen facedness allows thee to stare others out of countenance and make them uneasy between this sentence and the next the alarming female deity must be supposed to have gone on her embassy and to have delivered the message with which she had been entrusted written literally servant saruta biko no kami this is motowori reading the more usual reading issaruda hiko transposing thenigori hirata prefers to readsada biko and takessarudaorsadato be the name of place which indeed seems the most acceptable view the name actually signifies monkey field motowori interpretation of its import is marvellous example of japanese etymological gymnastics see vol xv of his commentary moribe derivation fromsari hate hiko is no better or guide for these five names and for the deity thought includer and the heavenly hand strength male deity mentioned few lines further on see sect xvi notes and respectively tomo no wo this expression is here taken to refer to the various offices assumed by the five deities in question at the time of the withdrawal of the sun goddess into the cave it signifies properly the head of company the allusion is to the story in sect xvi moribe in his critique on motowori commentary points out that it was only the mirror which allured the goddess from the cave in the japanese original of this passage however even more than in the english translation the expression that had allured is made to both objects obtained from the tail of the serpent of koshi see the story in sect xviii ame no iha to wake no kami hirata observes that this must not be considered as the name of an independent deity but be taken simply as an alternative name ofame no jikara wo no kami the heavenly hand strength male deity the part taken by this deity in the legend narrated in sect xvi seems sufficient warrant for such an opinion though little lower down in this section the two are again mentioned separately toko yo these words which according to the rules of japanese construction are placed at the commencement of the clause must be understood to apply either to the three gods collectively or to the first mentioned the deity thought includer alone or worshipping before us or in our presence the strictly logical concordance of an english sentence makes it appear as if the mirror were to be taken to represent the spirit of both deities whose names are subjects of the first clause in japanese however all such concordances are much more loosely observed and it is only the spirit of the sun goddess that we must understand to be here intended isuzu literally fifty bells or else perhaps the name of kind of grass with which the neighbourhood may originally have been overgrown is the name of the site of the inner temple of ise it is in the japanese text preceded by the pillow wordsaku kushiro literally rent bracelet see mabuchi dictionary of pillow words toyo uke no kami the same astoyo uke bime see sect vii note the mention of this goddess in this place is curious as she would not seem to be connected with the legend motowori however supposes that it is through some accidental omission that she does not figure in the list of deities said to have accompanied the heaven descended sovereign this name signifies meeting when crossing or crossing to meet and is connected by the commentators with an unimportant tradition for which see motowori commentary vol xv these two names are in the originalkushi iha ma do no kamiandtoyo iha mado no kami the tradition in the gleanings of ancient story makes them two separate deities viz of the gate or gates of the imperial palace etymology obscure nakatomi no murazhi nakatomiis taken by motowori to be contraction ofnaka tori omi and by mabuchi to be contraction ofnaka tori omi either of which may be freely rendered middlemen intercessors referring to the religious functions which were hereditary in this family see commentary on the ritual of the general purification vol ii pp imibe no obito imibeis derived fromimu to avoid to abstain from andmure flock or collection of persons clan and refers to the religious duties of this hereditary class of priests which naturally required their avoidance of all ceremonial uncleanness the word priest would fairly though freely represent the meaning of the compound saru me no kimi for the traditional origin of this name see sect xxxv these duchesses were priestesses but it is matter of dispute between the commentators whether the title was simply an official one or hereditary in the female line kagami tsukuri no murazhi of this family nothing would seem to be known tama no ya ortama n’oya no murazhi but the name should probably betama tsukuri no murazhi jewel making chieftains gentile name which is found in the later literature perhaps however we should understand both this means and the previous one to be simple inventions by names of which divine ancestry was claimed for the hereditary guilds of jewellers and mirror makers next section xxxiv —the august reign in himuka of his augustness prince rice ear ruddy plenty the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com so then the heaven shining great august deity and the high integrating deity commanded his augustness heaven prince rice ear ruddy plenty and he leaving the heavenly rock seat pushing asunder the eight fold heavenly spreading clouds and dividing road with mighty road dividing set off floating shut up in the floating bridge of heaven and descended from heaven onto the peak of kuzhifuru which is takachiho in tsu kushi so his heavenly great wondrous augustness and his augustness heaven round eyes both taking on their backs the heavenly rock quivers taking at their side the large mallet headed swords taking in their hands the heavenly vegetable wax tree bow and clasping under their arms the heavenly true deer arrows stood in his august van in respectful attendance so his heavenly great wondrous augustness is the ancestor of the kume lords thereupon he said this place is opposite to the land of kara one comes straight across to the august cape of kasasa and it is land whereon the morning sun shines straight land which the evening sun sunlight illumines so this place is an exceedingly good place having thus spoken he made stout the temple pillars on the nethermost rock bottom and made high the cross beams to the plain of high heaven and dwelt there motowori makes sect xxxiv commence here and it seems on the whole best to follow him in so doing as the entire period of the reign on earth of the first of the heaven descended gods is thus included in one section on the other hand the descent from heaven which gives its name to the preceding sect cannot properly be said to be accomplished until the end of this first sentence of sect xxxiv it will be remembered that the japanese name of this first deity king is in its abbreviated and most commonly used form hiko ho no ni nigi motowori proposes to suppress the character commanded in this clause and the character and at the beginning of the next and to take the prince as the subject of the whole sentence this would be convenient but the charactersandare in all the texts his place in heaven the original japanese of the term isama no ikakura the translator has adopted the interpretation proposed by hirata the only commentator who gives an acceptable view of this extremely difficult clause which motowori admitted that he did not understand it must be remembered that hirata identifies the floating bridge of heaven with the heavenly rock boat for details see his exposition of the ancient histories vol xxvii pp

idea that oho kume and oho tomo were two distinct personages the elaborate and interesting note on this subject in his examination of difficult words vol ii pp is well worth consulting the only point in which the present writer differs from him is with regard to the etymology of the wordkume which moribe connects withkumi company andkuma bravo whereas in the opinion of the former it is probably nothing more nor less than an ancient mispronunciation of the chinese wordchun modern japanesegun army troops the auxiliary numeral here used is that properly denoting human beings not deities futari

motowori however though not daring actually to alter the characters assumes that they are corrupt and in his kane rendering gives us this instead thereupon passing searchingly through bare backed empty country he arrived at the august cape of kasasa and said this land is land whereon the morning sun shines straight etc his evident reason for wishing to alter the reading is simply and solely to concealp the fact that korea is mentioned in not unfriendly manner in the traditional account of the divine age long before the epoch of itsso calledrevelation and conquest by the empress jin go see sect xcvi to xcviii that the parallel passage of the chronicles lends some sanction to his view is no excuse for so dishonest treatment of the text he undertakes to commentate for the records and the chronicles often differ greatly in the accounts they have preserved one of motowori arguments is that as kasasa is said to have been in the province of hiuga it could not have been opposite to korea seeing that hiuga faces east and not west he here forgets that little later on in his own same commentary vol xvii he asserts that hiuga in ancient times included the provinces of ohosumi and satsuma the latter of which does face west he built himself palace to dwell in conf sect xxxii note next section xxxv —the duchess of saru the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com

the women are duchesses of saru see sect xxxiii from little before note to note instead of the men being dukes as would be more natural the title was confined to females see sect xxxiii note next section xxxvi —the deity prince of saruta at azaka the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com now when this deity prince of saruta dwelt at azaka he went out fishing and had his hand caught by ahirabushell fish and was drowned in the brine of the sea so the name by which he was called when he sank to the bottom was the bottom touching august spirit the name by which he was called when the sea water gurgled up was the gurgling up august spirit the name by which he was called when the bubbles formed was the bubble bursting august spirit thereupon her augustness the heavenly alarming female having escorted back the deity prince of saruta came back and at once drove together all the things broad of fin and the things narrow of fin and asked them saying will ye respectfully serve the august son of the heavenly deities —upon which all the fishes declared that they would respectfully serve him only the bèche de mer said nothing then her augustness the heavenly alarming female spoke to the bèche de mer saying ah this mouth is mouth that gives no reply —and with these words slit the mouth with her stiletto so at the present day the bèche de mer has slit mouth wherefore from august reign to august reign when the offerings of the first fruits of shima are presented to the emperor portion of them is granted to the duchesses of saru etymology unknown what species was denoted by this ancient name is not clear but one of motowori suggestion to the effect that it may have been identical with the modernsarubo yahi shell of familyarcadæ probablyarca subcrenata the origin of whose name would thus be traced up to the mythological age is at least ingenious soko daku mi tama tsubu tatsu mi tama aka saku mi tama sakumight be translated by opening forming etc it is the same word as that used to express the blossoming of flower the characters rendered came back are motowori and hirata believeto be put erroneously for which would give the sense of arrived there and would thus enable us to locate the episode of the fishes at ise instead of in hiuga which would better suit the concluding clause of this section narrating the participation of the duchesses of sara in the first fruits of the province of shims if the word shima however here means not the province of that name but simply islands in general there is nothing to be gained by the pro posed emendation which has moreover no sanction from any text and it may be added that no notice is to be found in any history of the custom here said to have existed all the fishes both great and small literally small string sword supposed to have been so called from its having been carried inside the garments attached to the under belt the smallest of the japanese provinces situated to the east of ise the name signifies island and it is possible that it ought here to be taken in that sense as common noun next section xxxvii —the curse of the deity great mountain possessor the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com hereupon his augustness heaven sun height prince rice ear ruddy plenty met beautiful person at the august cape of kasasa and asked her whose daughter she was she replied saying am daughter of the deity great mountain possessor and my name is the divine princess of ata another name by which am called being princess blossoming brilliantly

quomodo videtur she replied saying am not able to say my father the deity great mountain possessor will say so he sent request for her to her father the deity great mountain possessor who greatly delighted respectfully sent her off joining to her her elder sister princess long as the rocks and causing merchandise to be carried on tables holding an hundred so then owing to the elder sister being very hideous his augustness prince rice ear ruddy plenty was alarmed at the sight of her and sent her back only keeping the younger sister princess blossoming brilliantly like the flowers of the trees whom he wedded for one night then the deity great mountain possessor was covered with shame at princess long as the rocks being sent back and sent message to his augustness prince rice ear ruddy plenty saying my reason for respectfully presenting both my daughters together was that by sending princess long as the rocks the august offspring of the heavenly deity though the snow fall and the wind blow might live eternally immovable like unto the enduring rocks and again that by sending princess blossoming brilliantly like the flowers of the trees they might live flourishingly like unto the flowering of the blossoms of the trees to insure this offered them but owing to thy thus sending back princess long as the rocks and keeping only princess blossoming brilliantly like the flowers of the trees the august offspring of the heavenly deity shall be but as frail as the flowers of the trees so it is for this reason that down to the present day the august lives of their augustnesses the heavenly sovereigns are not long see sect vi note kamu ata tsu hime atais place in satsuma or tree ka no hama saku ya hime perhaps though there is no native authority for doing so we might rather

signification in this and similar names it will be remembered that there was another sister named princess falling like the flowers of the trees see sect xx note or perhaps so written the original expression were here better rendered by sisters as enduring as the rocks the original name isiha naga hime the character used here and immediately below for the first personal pronoun is servant every kind of goods as dowry for his daughters the usual word child is employed in the text but it here almost certainly has as motowori suggests more extended meaning and signifies the posterity of the sun goddess or of prince rice ear ruddy plenty generally the emperors of japan the vaguer term offspring is therefore nearer to the author intention either of the sun goddess or of prince rice ear ruddy plenty there is no difference in the sense whichever of these two deities we take the speaker to refer to the sun goddess was his ancestress and he was ancestor of the japanese emperors or snow and rain the reading being uncertain or having sworn this or pledged myself to the accomplishment of this the chinese characters used are those properly denoting the presenting of tribute motowori proposes an emendation in this passage oftowhich would not materially alter the sense the precise meaning of the syllablesa ma hi no mi here rendered by the words but as frail in accordance with motowori and moribe tentative interpretation is extremely obscure the parallel passage in the chronicles is fading and falling like the flowers of the trees the characters rendered heavenly sovereign are common japanese designation of the emperor it would especially in the later volumes of this work where the expression is repeated on almost every page be more convenient to translate by the single word emperor but the commentators lay great stress on the high significance of the component portions of the title which they contend was not borrowed from china but was first used in japan it is first met with in chinese history in the middle of the seventh century of our era just early enough indeed for it to have been borrowed before the time of the compilation of these records but as there was no difficulty in putting together the two component parts heavenly sovereign it is possible that the contention of the japanese commentators is correct the ancient pure native term seems to have beensumera mikoto for which mr satow has proposed the rendering of sovereign augustness next section xxxviii —the august child bearing of princess blossoming brilliantly like the flowers of the trees

western corner of japan which was subsequently divided into the provincesp of satsuma and ohosumi and came by metonymy to be used to denote the province of satsuma itself for which reason it remained as the pillow word for the word satsuma even after the exclusive use of this latter name had been established in after times thehayabito also contracted tohayatoandhaito were chiefly known as forming the infantry of the imperial guard curious choice of provincials for which mythological sanction was invoked they are also said to have furnished the performers of symbolic dance mentioned at the end of sect xli see note to that sect in later sections of this work the translator has ventured to renderhayabitoby man at arms ho suseri no mikoto the honorific is doubtless prefixed in this case and not in the others because it was to this prince or deity that the imperial house traced its descent motowori skanareading which prefixes honorifics to all such names indifferently obliterates this delicate distinction ho wori no mikoto the derivation of this name is less clear than that of his elder brothers motowori proposal to consider it as corruption ofho yohari fire weakening is however plausible and as this triad of names is evidently intended to paint the stages in the progress of the conflagration the import of the third must be something very like what motowori suggests even if his guess at the original form of the word be not quite correct the names of all three brethren differ more or less in the parallel passage of the chronicles ama tsu hi daka hiko ho ho de mi no mikoto

exchange of luck the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com so his augustness fire shine was prince who got his luck on the sea and caught things broad of fin and things narrow of fin his augustness fire subside was prince who got his luck on the mountains and caught things rough of hair and things soft of hair then his augustness fire subside said to his elder brother his augustness fire shine let us mutually exchange and use each other luck nevertheless though he thrice made the request his elder brother would not accede to it but at last with difficulty the mutual exchange was obtained then his augustness fire subside undertaking the sea luck angled for fish but never got single fish and moreover he lost the fish hook in the sea thereupon his elder brother his augustness fire shine asked him for the fish hook saying mountain luck is luck of its own and sea luck is luck of its own let each of us now restore to the other his luck to which the younger brother his augustness fire subside replied saying as for thy fish hook did not get single fish by angling with it and at last lost it in the sea but the elder brother required it of him the more urgently so the younger brother breaking his ten grasp sabre that was augustly girded on him made of the fragments five hundred fish hooks as compensation but he would not take them again he made thousand fish hooks as compensation but he would not receive them saying still want the real original fish hook for the archaic japanese worksachi here rendered luck there is no satisfactory english equivalent its original and most usual signification is luck happiness then that which man is lucky in or skilful at —his forte and finally that which he procures by his luck or skill and the implements which he uses in procuring it the exchange negotiated below was doubtless that of the bow and arrows of one deity for the other deity fish hook some men are naturally good hunters and others naturally good fishermen let us therefore restore to each other the implements necessary to the successful following of our respective avocations —the clause rendered let each of us now restore to the other his luck is little confused in the original but thekanareadings both old and new agree in interpreting it as has here been done see sect viii note next section xl —the palace of the ocean possessor the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com hereupon as the younger brother was weeping and lamenting by the sea shore the deity salt possessor came and asked him saying what is the cause of the sky sun height weeping and lamentation he replied saying had exchanged fish hook with my elder brother and have lost that fish hook and as he asks me for it have given him many fish hooks as compensation but he will not receive them saying still want the original fish hook so weep and lament for this then the deity salt possessor said will give good counsel to thine augustness —and there with built stout little boat without interstices and set him in the boat and instructed him saying when shall have pushed the boat off go on for some time there will be savoury august road and if thou goest in the boat along that road there will appear palace built like fishes scales —which is the palace of the deity ocean possessor when thou reachest the august gate of that deity palace there will be multitudinous ly branching cassia tree above the well at its side so if thou sit on the top of that tree the sea deity daughter will see thee and counsel thee so following these instructions his augustness fire subside went little way and everything happened as the deity salt possessor had said and he forthwith climbed the cassia tree and sat there then when the hand maidens of the sea deity daughter luxuriant jewel princess bearing jewelled vessels were about to draw water there was light in the well on looking up there was beautiful young man they thought it very strange paragraph continues then his augustness fire subside saw the handmaidens and begged to be given some water the handmaidens at once drew some water put it into jewelled vessel and respectfully presented it to him then without drinking the water he loosened the jewel at his august neck took it in his mouth and spat it into the jewelled vessel thereupon the jewel adhered to the vessel and the handmaidens could not separate the jewel from the vessel so they took it with the jewel adhering to it and presented it to her augustness luxuriant jewel princess then seeing the jewel she asked her hand maidens saying is there perhaps some one outside the gate they replied saying there is some one sitting on the top of the cassia tree above our well it is very beautiful young man he is more illustrious even than our king lo as he begged for water we respectfully gave him water but without drinking the water he spat this jewel into the vessel as we were not able to separate this from the other we have brought the vessel with the jewel in it to present to thee then her augustness luxuriant jewel princess thinking it strange went out to look and was forthwith delighted at the sight they exchanged glances after which she spoke to her father saying there is beautiful person at our gate then the sea deity him self went out to look and saying this person is the sky sun height the august child of the heaven sun height led him into the interior of the palace and spreading eight layers of rugs of sea asses skins and spreading on the top other eight layers of silk rugs and setting him on the top of them arranged merchandise on tables holding an hundred made an august banquet and forthwith gave him his daughter luxuriant jewel princess in marriage so he dwelt in that land for three years hereupon his augustness fire subside thought of what had gone before and heaved one deep sigh so her augustness luxuriant jewel princess hearing the sigh informed her father saying though he has dwelt three years with us he had never sighed but this night he heaved one deep sigh what may be the cause of it the great deity her father asked his son in law saying this morning heard my daughter speak saying though he has dwelt three years with us he had never sighed but this night he heaved one deep sigh what may the cause be moreover what was the cause of thy coming here then his augustness fire subside told the great deity exactly how his elder brother had pressed him for the lost fish hook thereupon the sea deity summoned together all the fishes of the sea great and small and asked them saying is there perchance any fish that has taken this fish hook so all the fishes replied lately thetahi has complained of something sticking in its throat preventing it from eating so it doubtless has taken the hook on the throat of thetahibeing thereupon examined there was the fish hook in it being forthwith taken it was washed and respectfully presented to his augustness fire subside whom the deity great ocean possessor then instructed saying what thou shalt say when thou grantest this fish hook to thine elder brother is as follows this fish hook is big hook an eager hook poor hook silly hook having thus spoken bestow it with thy back hand having done thus —if thine elder brother make high fields do thine augustness make low fields and if thine elder brother make low fields do thine augustness make high fields if thou do thus thine elder brother will certainly be impoverished in the space of three years owing to my ruling the water if thine elder brother incensed at thy doing thus should attack thee put forth the tide flowing jewel to drown him if he express grief put forth the tide ebbing jewel to let him live thus shalt thou harass him with these words the sea deity gave to his augustness fire subside the tide flowing jewel and the tide ebbing jewel —two in all —and forthwith summoned together all the crocodiles and asked them saying the sky sun height august child of the heaven sun height is now about to proceed out to the upper land who will in how many days respectfully escort him and bring back report so each according to the length of his body in fathoms spoke fixing certain number of days —one of them crocodile one fathom long saying will escort him and come back in one day so then the sea deity said to the crocodile one fathom long if that be so do thou respectfully escort him while crossing the middle of the sea do not alarm him forthwith he seated him upon the crocodile head and saw him off so the crocodile respectfully escorted him home in one day as he had promised when the crocodile was about to return his augustness fire subside untied the stiletto which was girded on him and setting it on the crocodile neck sent the latter back so the crocodile one fathom long is now called the deity blade possessor shiho tsuchi no kami the view of the meaning of this name which has here been taken is founded on the persistent use in all documents of the character salt to write the first element of the compound and of varying characters to write the syllablestsuandchi an indication that the latter are to be taken phonetically and may therefore be interpreted to signifytsu mochi possessor of as in numerous other instances the fact that this god is known as the god of salt manufacturers see tanigaha shinsei perpetual commentary on the chronicles of japan vol vii adds another reason for rejecting both motowori far fetched derivation of the name forshiri oho tsu mochi great possessor of knowledge and his assertion that it denotes noindividualdeity but any one gifted with superior wisdom sora tsu hi daka it will be remembered thatama tsu hi daka heaven sun height was the first part of prince fire subsides alternative name see sect xxxviii note the distinction between these two almost identical appellations would seem to be that the former is used of the heir apparent the latter of

shadow the parallelp passage in the chronicles having human shadow and his view is absolved from unreasonableness by the fact of the confusion between light and shade which has always existed in japanese phraseology thushi kagemay signify either sunlight or shadow cast by the sun it is safest however to adhere to the chinese characters employed by the author and in this special instance we may well suppose him to have intended to say that celestial light shone from the body of the god in question such an idea is not foreign to classical japanese ways of thought and expression see also sect xlvi note or taking the characteras an initial particle so as we were not able to separate one from the other see note to this section this is literal translation of the chinese characters by

things as the character for one is thrice repeated in this passage motowori is probably right in saying that it should be given its proper signification and the translator therefore renders it by the

the familysparoidei the former being thepagrus cardinalis the latter probably the major or of fish bone in its throat tanigaha shisei quoting from urabe no kaneyoshi comments thus on the parallel passage in the chronicles where the whole of this legend is given several times in slightly varying forms by big hook is meant one that will not serve its purpose because too big eager signifies that which endeavours to but cannot advance silly means unintelligent hence we have hook which not serving its purpose will be of no use whatever but rather road to lead him who possesses it to poverty poor outwardly and inwardly silly he will be the most useless creature in the empire it should be noted however that motowori interprets in the sense of gloomy and moribe in the sense of drowning the phonetically written and obscure word obo here rendered great with thy hand behind thy back this is supposed by the commentators to have been sort of charm by which evil was averted from the person of him who practised it and they point out that izanagi the male who invites brandished his sword behind him when he was pursued by the hosts of hades see sect ix note by high fields and low fields are

to which the verbs are to be taken in causative sense to the following effect had always wished to let people comep and go across the sea path probably it was only in order to make this clause fit in better with the following sentence in which we are told that the crocodile princess closed the sea boundary and with the fact that there is at present no path leading to the sea god palace that motowori was induced to sanction such view of the grammar of this passage this is motowori interpretation of the clause he having emended action doing which is found in the older editions shame faced

which would have no evident personal applicability legend in the chronicles connects the name of this place with the wordtobi kite it being there related that miraculous gold coloured kite came and

to be an interpolation motowori avers that the character cross has no importance and should be neglected in reading but this assertion seems gratuitous in the face of for instance such chinese

motowori to supplement an evident lacuna in the text or luckily with morning eyes motowori remarks that even in modern times special joy is felt at good discovery made in the morning next section xlvi —emperor jim mu part iii —the gigantic crow and gods with tails the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com then his augustness the great high integrating deity again commanded

the deity instructions he reached the lower course of the yeshinu river where there was person catching fish in weir then the august child of the heavenly deity asked saying who art thou he replied saying am an earthly deity and am called by the name of nihe motsu no ko this is the ancestor of the cormorant keepers of aha on his augustness kamu yamato ihare biko making his progress thence person

art thou he replied saying am an earthly deity and my name is iha oshi waku no ko heard just now that the august son of the heavenly deity was making his progress so it is for that that have come to meet thee this is the ancestor of the territorial owners of yeshinu thence his augustness kamu yamato ihare biko penetrated over on foot to uda so they say the ugachi of uda the intention of the writer is here obscure but he probably meant the following passage to form part of the dream as is the case in the parallel passage of the chronicles the inverted commas are therefore continued in the translation the characters ya to garasu with which the original of this expression is written combined with the mention in the preface of the great crow have determined the translator to adopt the interpretation favoured by tanigaha shisei viz crow eight feet long motowori understands the expression to mean an eight headed crow for the arguments on both sides see the perpetual commentary on the chronicles of japan vol vii and motowori commentary vol xviii pp and vol viii pp see also for the translation of parallel passage sect xvi note better known by the classical and modern form of the name yoshino it seems to signify good moor yoshino which is in the province of yamato has from the earliest times been renowned for the beauty of its cherry blossoms and also figures largely in the early and mediaeval history motowori points out geographical difficulties in the imperial progress as here detailed in the chronicles the verisimilitudes of the journey are better observed the character here rendered weir for want of better word is defined as signifying bamboo trap for catching fish the first personal pronoun is here represented by the humble character servant the other tailed deity mentioned immediately below uses the same expression see sect note and sect xliv note for the considerations that make it better to translate thus than to render by am deity of the land offering bearing child here and elsewhere the wordko child as part of proper name should be understood as kind of honorific employed probably in imitation of chinese usage adanou kaki this must be understood to be gentile name kabane the etymology of ada is uncertain the practice of fishing with the help of cormorants though now almost obsolete seems to have been very common in japan down to the middle ages commenting on similar passage little further on motowori naively remarks it appears that in very ancient times such persons were occasionally to be met with it should be added that they are also mentioned in chinese literature well shine yeshinu no obito for yeshinu see note disappearing among the mountains yeshinu no kuzu kuzuis contraction ofkuni nushi properly with which characters the name is found written at the commencement of sect cviii though elsewhere the semi phonetic renderingoris employed etymologyobscure uda no ugachi the meaning of the sentence is hence the name of the ugachi of uda ugachisignifies to penetrate but the etymology seems forced one and motowori is probably correct in identifying this gentile name with that of ukashi mentioned in the next sentence next section xlvii —emperor jim mu part iv —the ukashi brethren the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com so then there were in uda two persons ukashi the elder brother and ukashi the younger brother so paragraph continues his augustness kamu yamato ihare biko sent the crow eight feet long in advance to ask these persons saying the august child of the heavenly deity has made progress hither will ye respectfully serve him hereupon ukashi the elder brother waited for and shot at the messenger with whizzing barb to make him turn back so the place where the whizzing barb fell is called kabura zaki saying that he intended to wait for and smite his augustness kamu yamato ihare biko he tried to collect an army but being unable to collect an army he said deceitfully that he would respectfully serve his augustness kamu yamato ihare biko and built great palace and in that palace set pitfall and waited then ukashi the younger brother came out to his augustness kamu yamato ihare biko beforehand and made obeisance saying mine elder brother ukashi the elder brother has shot at and turned back the messenger of the august child of the heavenly deity and intending to wait for and attack thee has tried to collect an army but being unable to collect it he has built great palace and set gin within it intending to wait for and catch thee so have come out to inform thee of this then the two persons his augustness michi no omi ancestor of the ohotomo chieftains and his augustness ohokume ancestor of the kume lords summoned ukashi the elder brother and reviled him saying into the great palace which thou hast built to respectfully serve his augustness kamu yamato ihare biko be thou the first to enter and declare plainly the manner in which thou intendest respectfully to serve him —and forthwith grasping the hilts of their cross swords playing with their spears and fixing arrows in their bows they drove him in whereupon he was caught in the gin which he himself had set and died so they forthwith pulled him out and cut him in pieces so the place is called uda no chihara having done thus his augustness kamu yamato ihare biko bestowed on his august army the whole of the great banquet presented to him by ukashi the younger brother at this time he sang saying the woodcock for which laid wood cock snare and waited in the high castle of uda strikes not against it but valiant whale strikes against it if the elder wife ask for fish slice off little like the berries of the stand soba if the younger wife ask for fish slice off quantity like the berries of the vigoroussasaki ugh pfui dolt this is saying thou rascal ah pfui dolt this is laughing him to scorn so ukashi the younger brother he is the ancestor of the water directors of uda ye ukashiandoto ukashi ukashi as in the other compounds where it occurs is probably in reality the name of place its etymology is doubtful barb point or cape or hall the original has respectful expression which is elsewhere translated waited on the first personal pronoun is represented by the respectful character servant literally spread this gin is supposed to have been of the kind whose top closes down after the man or animal has fallen into it grandee of the way this gentile name is said in the chronicles to have been bestowed on this worthy in consideration of the services as guide to his master the emperor on the occasion of the latter progress eastward see sect xxxiv note perhaps great round eyes supposed to be descendant of his augustnessama tsu kume see however sect xxxiv note for discussion of the etymology ofkume see sect xxxiv note the expressioni ga here rendered thou is as motowori remarks extremely hard to understand and its interpretation as an insulting form of the second personal pronoun is merely tentative perhaps the text is corrupt the insulting second pronounoreis here employed here again we have an expression written phonetically and of uncertain import the translator has followed motowori in tentatively rendering it according to the ideographic reading of the parallel passage of the chronicles literally struck by uda blood plain this song is unusually difficult of comprehension and the latest important commentator moribe seems to show satisfactorily that all his predecessors motowori included more or less misunderstood it he had at least the advantage of coming after them and the translator has followed his interpretation excepting with regard toisukukashi the pillow word for whale which is here rendered valiant in accordance with the traditional view of its signification thesobatree is identified by motowori with thekaname mochi photinia glabra thissaka ki taken together with its prefixichi here rendered vigorous is supposed in this place to signify not the usualcleyera japonica but another species popularly known as thebishiya gaki whose english or latin name the translator has failed to ascertain it has large berry whereas the soba has small one the following is the gist of moribe exposition of the general signification of the song if for ukashi mean design to kill the emperor in gin there be sought term of comparison in the whales and woodcock forming the imperial banquet then in lieu of the woodcock that he expected to catch in the trap that he set that great whale the imperial host has rushed up against it again if as the fishermen wives might do your you soldiers wives ask youp for fish then let each of you give to his elder wife of whom he must have grown weary only small and bony portion and to his younger wife who is doubtless his heart favourite good fleshy piece so jocular guess at the penchantsof the young warriors excites their ardour which they give vent to in the following shouts some of the japanese originals of this string of interjections are of uncertain import the translator has been guided by motowori conjectures with which moribe mostly agrees the exclamations are supposed not to form part of the actual song but to proceed from the mouths of the imperial soldiers the words rendered this is saying thou rascal such is apparently their meaning and those rendered this is laughing him to scorn seem to be glosses as old as the text which had already been obscure in the eighth century they are not written altogether phonetically uda na mohitori this tribe or guild of water directors was entrusted with the charge of the water the ice and the gruel used in the imperial household in later times the wordmohitoriwas corrupted tomondo next section xlviii —emperor jim mu part —the earth spider of the cave of osaka the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com when his augustness kamu yamato ihare biko made his progress and reached the great cave of osaka earth spiders with tails namely eighty bravoes were in the cave awaiting him so then the august son of the heavenly deity commanded that banquet be bestowed on the eighty bravoes thereupon he set eighty butlers one for each of the eighty bravoes and girded each of them with sword and instructed the butlers saying when ye hear me sing cut them down simultaneously so the song by which he made clear to them to set about smiting the earth spiders said into the great caveofosaka people have entered in abundance and arep there though people have entered in abundance and are there the children of the augustly powerful warriors will smite and finish them with their mallet headed swords their stone mallet swords the children of the augustly powerful warriors with their mallet headed swords their stone mallet swords would now do well to smite having thus sung they drew their swords and simultaneously smote them to death the etymology of this name is not clear but readers will of course not confound it with that of the modern town of ohosaka ozaka the character rendered cave signifies simply apartment but the traditional reading ismuro which means cave or pit dug in the earth that the latter is the idea which the author wishes to convey becomes clear by comparison with greater number of passages in the older literature for more particular discussion of this subject see mr milne paper entitled notes on stone implements from otaru and hakodate published in vol viii part of these transactions et seq where number of passages relative to the earth spiders are likewise brought together tsuchi gumo generally written but here semi phonetically there is little doubt that by this well known name which has given rise to much conjecture race of cave dwelling savages or class of cave dwelling robbers is intended motowori supposes that their name had its origin in comparison of their habits with those of the spider but it were surely more rational to regard it as corruption oftsuchi gomori earth hiders designation as obvious as it is appropriate the chronicles describe one tribe of them as being short in stature and having long arms and legs like pigmies for further discussion of the subject see motowori commentary vol xix pp the perpetual commentary on the chronicles of japan vol viii the tou ya vol xx kumoand the examination of difficult words vol pp et seq the original term istakeru which might also be rendered bandit or robberchief the import of this poem is too clear to stand in need of explanation the wordmitsumitsushi here rendered augustly powerful in accordance with moribe view is understood by motowori to mean perfectly full in allusion to the fully or perfectly round eyes of the deity kume to whose name he supposes there to be reference mabuchi on the other hand explains the word to signify young and flourishing but moribe view both of this and of the import ofkumeas warriors seems so greatly preferable to any other that the translator has not hesitated to follow him conf sect xxxiv note the childrenof the warriors are of course the warriors themselves with regard to the signification of the two kinds of swords here mentioned it has however been thought best to adhere to the usual view and note to sect xxxiv should be referred to next section xlix —emperor jim mu part vi —the prince of tomi and the shiki brethren the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com after this when about to smite the prince of tomi he sang saying the children of the augustly powerful army will smite and finish the one stem of smelly chive in the millet field —the stem of its root both its root and shoots again he sang the ginger which the children of the augustly powerful army planted near the hedge resounds in the mouth shall not forget it will smite and finish it again he sang saying like theturbinidæcreeping round the great rock in the sea of ise on which blows the divine wind so will we creep round and smite and finish them again when he smote shiki the elder brother and shiki the younger brother the august army was temporarily exhausted then he sang saying as we fight placing our shields in row going and watching from between the trees on mount inasa oh we are famished ye keepers of cormorants the birds of the island come now to our rescue see sect xliv notes et seq the apparent want of sequence in this portion of the narrative is not noticed by motowori we might endeavour to harmonize it by supposing that after having slain the earth spiders etc the emperor jim mu turned round again to fight with the prince of tomi who had harassed him in the earlier portion of his career as conqueror of central japan the wild chive growing among the millet is of course the enemy the prince of tomi and his host and the gist of the song is that the imperial troops will smite and destroy them root and branch the commentators suppose the simile to have been taken from the fields of millet which jim mu troops planted for their subsistence during the long drawn out campaigns of early days —the stem of its root so ne ga moto is curious expression which is perhaps best accounted for by moribe supposition that we have here pun onsune ga moto sune house sune being natural abbreviation ofnagasune the name of the prince of tomi see sect xliv note the sense of this song is shall not forget the bitterness of seeing my brother slain by prince nagasune arrow see the latter part of sect xliv the word hazhikami here rendered ginger in accordance with motowori dictum is taken by moribe to signify the xanthoxylon resounding in the mouth is curious phrase here used to express bitterness motowori thus paraphrases this song as the innumerableturbinidæ shells creep round the great rock so will with the myriads of the imperial host encompass the prince of tomi on every side that there may be no outlet whereby he can escape the shell here mentioned is kind of small conch kama kazo no lit of divine wind is the pillow word for ise and is of disputed derivation as is the word ise itself the curious reader should refer to fujihara no hikomaro inquiry into the meaning of the names of all the provinces for the legend to which the name of ise and its pillow word were anciently traced and other conjectures on the point the great rock here mentioned is not otherwise known ye shikiandotoshiki shiki is the name of district in the province of yamato this song is request for provisions made by the emperor to some fishermen who were working their cormorants along the mountain streams moribe refers it to an incident not in the war but in the hunt and interprets differently the word here in accordance with its usual meaning and with older authority rendered as we fight he attributes to it the sense of as we put our shields together and thinks that the poet may have compared to shields the trunks of the trees according to this view the song should be viewed rather as joke it may be mentioned that there is good authority for considering the wordtata namete placing shields in row as punning preface or pillow word for words commencing withi ibeing the root ofiru to shoot so that moribe explanation need not involve any tautology it seems however somewhat far fetched —the position of mount inasa is uncertain and the name itself of obscure derivation next section —emperor jim mu part vii —the empire pacified the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com so then his augustness nigi hayabi waited on and said to the

yamato ihare biko dwelt at the palace of kashibara near unebi and ruled the empire the component parts of this name rendered according to the analogy of that in sect xxxiii note may be interpreted to signify plenty swift the genealogy of this god is not known the swords quivers bow and arrows mentioned in sect xxxiii as having been brought down from heaven by the divine attendants of the emperor jim mu grandfather tomi ya bime the syllableyais inexplicable but perhaps merely an expletive the signification of this name is by no means clear but rendered according to the characters with which it is written in the chronicles it would mean savoury true hand mononobe no murazhi this and the two following are of course gentile names hodzumi no omi hodzumi which is the name of place signifies rice ears piled up une be no omi the interpretation of this name is given according is motowori who explains that the members of this family —in particular the female members —waited at the emperor table and wore veils over their necks when so employed the name is commonly corrupted touneme better known as kashihabara the name signifies oak moor or rather place planted with oaks this is usually though without sufficient foundation reckoned the earliest of the historical capitals of japan it is in yamato unebi is the name of hill in yamato the etymology of the word is obscure ruled the empire from

children there were two —his augustness tagishi mimi next his augustness kisu mimi but when he sought for beautiful maiden to make her his chief empress his augustness oho kume said there is here beauteous maiden who is called the august child of deity the reason why she is called the august child of deity is that the princess seya datara daughter of mizokuhi of mishima was admired on account of her beauty by the great master of things the deity of miwa qui quum pulchra puella oletum fecit in sagittam rubro colore fucatam se convertit et ab inferiori parte cloacae ad usum faciendi oleti virginis privatas partes transfixit tunc pulchra virgo consternata est et surrexit et trepide fugit statim sagittam attulit et juxta thalamum posuit subito sagitta formosus adolescens facta est qui

abhorruit facere mentionem privatarum partium so therefore she is called the august child of deity hereupon seven beauteous maidens were out playing on the moor of takasazhi and suke yori hime was among them his augustness ohokume seeing suke yori hime spoke to the heavenly sovereign in song saying seven maidens on the moor of takasazhi in yamato —which shall be interlaced then suke yori hime was standing first among the beauteous maidens forthwith the heavenly sovereign having looked at the beauteous maidens and knowing in his august heart that suke yori hime was standing in the very front replied by song saying even after nought but fragment ary glimpse will intertwine the lovely one standing in the very front then his augustness ohokume informed suke yori hime of the heavenly sovereign decree whereupon she seeing the slit sharp eyes of his augustness ohokume sang in her astonishment saying wherefore the slit sharp eye then his augustness ohokume replied by song saying my slit sharp eyes are in order to find the maiden immediately so the maiden said that she would respectfully serve the heavenly sovereign hereupon the house of her augustness suke yori hime was on the back of the river sawi the heavenly sovereign made progress to the abode of suke yori hime and augustly slept there one night the reason why that river was called the river sawi was that on the river banks the mountain lily plant grew in abundance so the name of the mountain lily plant was taken and the designation of river sawi bestowed the name by which the mountain lily plant was originally called wassawi afterwards when suke yori hime came and entered into the palace the heavenly sovereign sang augustly saying in damp hut on the reed moor having spread layer upon layer of sedge mats we

the elder scholars who fancied they saw in the distinction of red and black some mysterious import connected with the four cardinal points in the old printed edition the text of this passage differs slightly from that adopted by motowori but the meaning is exactly the same large lacuna here occurs in the old printed edition in which the four hundred and forty five chinese characters forming the original of the following part of the translation from the words in consequence of this down to the words immediately preceding methinks this is sign on are missing both the editor of and motowori are

text next section lxv —emperor sū jin part iii story of oho tata ne ko birth the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com the reason why this person called oho tata ne ko was known to be deity child was that the above mentioned iku tama yori bime was regularly beautiful whereupon divine youth who thought the majesty of her appearance without comparison in the world came suddenly to her in the middle of the night so as they loved each other and lived in matrimony together the maiden ere long was pregnant then the father and mother astonished at their daughter being pregnant asked her saying thou art pregnant by thyself how art thou with child without having known man she replied saying have naturally conceived through beautiful young man whose name know not coming here every evening and staying with me therefore the father and mother wishing to know the man instructed their daughter saying sprinkle red earth in front of the couch and pass skein of hemp through needle and pierce therewith the skirt of his garment so she did as they had instructed and on looking in the morning the hemp that had been put in the needle went out through the hole of the door hook and all the hemp that remained was three twists only then forthwith knowing how he had gone out by the hook hole they went on their quest following the thread which reaching mount miwa stopped at the shrine of the deity so they knew that oho tata neko was the child of the deity residing there so the place was called by the name of miwa on account of the three twists of hemp that had remained his augustness oho tata ne ko here referred to was the ancestor of the dukes of miwa and of the dukes of kamo it is not easy to render literally into english the force of the characters

sequel and is therefore pointless the same japanese wordkagi which is used as the equivalent of the chinese character hook came in latter times to denote key three threads are in japanesemi wa whence

the modern kadzusa shimofusa and aha hitachi and michinoku vague name for the north eastern portions of the main island of the whole east and north east of the country he likewise supposes the use of the word road for circuit or province to have had its origin in the road along which the imperial officers despatched to the outlying provinces had to travel to reach their post and remarks very pertinently in another passage of his commentary that the term road denotes province more especially from the point of view of its subjugation or government his explanation is however rendered untenable by the fact that the division of the country into such roads or circuits was an idea evidently borrowed from the neighbouring peninsula of korea at first as in this passage somewhat vaguely used in the sense of province it settled down into the designation of set of adjacent provinces thus the tō kai dō or eastern maritime circuit includes fifteen provinces the hoku roku dō or northern

this reign the pool of yosami was made moreover the pool of sakawori at karu was made district forming the southern part of the modern province of ihashiro in north eastern japan the derivation here given fromahi dzu meeting port seems fanciful taxes levied on the produce of the chase by which the men gained their livelihood and on the domestic handwork of the women motowori has not particularly satisfactory note in which he endeavours to explain this obscure phrase the word first should evidently qualify the verb ruled and not the substantive land and the applicability of the saying to sovereign of whom it is not recorded that he initiated anything save the taxes is not apparent the author of the chronicles observes the verisimilitudes better by applying synonymous designation to the first earthly emperor jim mu see sect lxii note reference to the parallel passage of the chronicles shows that probably couple of words are here omitted from the text which should read the pool of

and the empress saho bime the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com when this heavenly sovereign made saho bime his empress her augustness saho bime elder brother king saho biko asked his younger sister saying which is dearer to thee thine elder brother or thy husband she replied saying mine elder brother is dearer then king saho biko conspired saying if be truly the dearer to thee let me and thee rule the empire and forthwith he made an eight times tempered stiletto and handed it to his younger sister saying slay the heavenly sovereign in his sleep with this small knife so the heavenly sovereign not knowing of this conspiracy was augustly sleeping with the empress’ august knees as his pillow then the empress tried to cut his august throat with the stiletto but though she lifted it thrice she could not cut the throat for an irrepressible feeling of sadness and she wept tears which fell overflowing onto the heavenly sovereign august face straightway the heavenly sovereign started up and asked the empress saying have had strange dream violent shower came from the direction of saho and suddenly wetted my face again small damask coloured snake coiled itself round my neck of what may such dream be the omen then the empress thinking it improper to dispute forthwith informed the heavenly sovereign saying mine elder brother king saho biko asked me saying which is dearer to thee thy husband or thine elder brother so as was embarrassed by this direct question replied saying oh mine elder brother is the dearer then he charged me saying and thou will together rule the empire so the heavenly sovereign must be slain —and so saying he made an eight times tempered stiletto and handed it to me therefore wanted to cut thine august throat but though thrice lifted the weapon feeling of regret suddenly arose so that could not cut thy throat and the tears that wept fell and wetted thine august face the dream was surely the omen of this then the heavenly sovereign said how nearly have been destroyed and forthwith he raised an army to smite king saho biko whereupon the king made rice castle to await the fray at this time her augustness saho bime unable to forget her elder brother fled out through the back gate of the palace and came into the rice castle for stiletto see above sect xxxvi note the curious word ya shio wori in the text seems to have the sense of eight times tempered tempered over and over again which motowori assigns to it the same expression is used in sect xviii note to denote the refining of rice liquor this word overflowing is more appropriately placed in the version of the story given in the chronicles where the author makes her tears first fill her sleeve common japanese figure of speech and thence overflow on to the sleeping monarch face seeing that it would be vain in deny the truth the first personal pronoun is written with the self depreciatory character concubine or enticed this expression which is repeated elsewhere is one which has given rise to considerable amount of discussion the chronicles tell us expressly that rice stalks were piled up to make castle —an assertion which as motowori remarks is simply incredible he therefore adopts mabuchi suggestion that castlelikea rice castle is what is intended rice castle being taken to mean rice store or granary such granaries having probably been stoutly built in order to protect them from thieves the historian of the tang dynasty quoted in the exposition of the foreign notices of japan says that the japanese had no castles but only palisades of timber the latter might well however have been called castles by the japanese though theywouldnot have been accounted such by the chinese who already built theirs of stone next section lxxi —emperor sui nin part iii —birth of prince homu chi wake and death of the conspirators the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com at this time the empress was pregnant thereupon the heavenly sovereign could not restrain his pity for the empress who was pregnant and whom he had loved for now three years so he turned his army aside and did not hasten the attack during this delay the august child that she had conceived was born so having put out the august child and set it outside the rice castle she caused these words to be said to the heavenly sovereign if this august child be considered to be the heavenly sovereign august child let him deign to undertake it hereupon the heavenly sovereign said although detesting the elder brother yet cannot repress my love for the empress and forthwith planned to secure the empress wherefore choosing from among his warriors band of the strongest and deftest he charged them saying when ye take the august child likewise abduct the queen its mother whether by the hair or by the hands or wherever ye may best lay hold of her clutch her and drag her out then the empress knowing his intention beforehand shaved off all her hair and covered her head with her hair and likewise made her jewel string rotten and wound it thrice round her arm and moreover made her august garments rotten by means of rice liquor and put on the garments as if they were whole having made these preparations she took the august child in her arms and pushed it outside the castle then the strong men taking the august child forthwith clutched at the august parent then on their clutching her august hair the august hair fell off of itself on their clutching her august arms the jewel string likewise snapped on their clutching her august garments the august garments at once tore therefore they obtained the august child but did not get the august parent so the warriors came back to the sovereign and reported saying on account of her august hair falling off of itself of her august garments easily tearing and moreover of the jewel string which was wound round her august hand at once snapping we have not got the august parent but we have obtained the august child then the heavenly sovereign sorry and angry hated the people who made the jewels and deprived them all of their lands so the proverb says landless jewels makers again did the heavenly sovereign cause the empress to be told saying child name must be given by the mother by what august name shall this child be called then she replied saying as he was born now at the time of the castle being burnt with fire and in the midst of the fire it were proper to call him by the august name of prince homu chi wake and again he caused her to be asked how shall he be reared she replied saying he must be reared by taking an august mother and fixing on old bathing women and young bathing women so he was respectfully reared in accordance with the empress instructions again he asked the empress saying who shall loosen the fresh small pendant which thou elitist make fast she replied saying it were proper that ye hime and oto hime daughters of king tatasu michi no ushi prince of taniha should serve thee for these two queens are of unsullied parentage so at last the heavenly sovereign slew king saho biko and his younger sister followed him her augustness saho bime who was the subject of the preceding sentence the sovereign the import of this passage is according to motowori that the empress imagined that her own conduct might perhaps influence the emperor to refuse to give the child she bore him its proper rank —not from doubts as to its legitimacy but as having rebel mother by undertaking the child is of course meant undertaking the care and education of it motowori supposes the chinese character rendered said to be an error and prefers to consider this clause as containing not the words but the thought of the monarch it would certainly be more convenient to adopt this view if it were sanctioned by any text or as motowori prefers to read deprived them of all theirlands there is nowhere else any reference to this saying motowori supposes it to point to those who hoping for reward get punishment instead these jewellers having doubtless rotted the string on which the beads were strung by special desire of the empress whereas they ended by getting nothing but confiscation for their pains motowori following mabuchi is evidently correct in supposing the characterin this place and again little further on to be copyist error for caused and the translator has rendered it accordingly prince is here written this name may also be readho muchi wake and is in the chronicles given asho muchi wakewhile it appears ashomuchi wakeat the commencement of sect lxix the first two elements apparently signify fire possessing whilewakeis the frequently recurring honorific signifying either lord or young and flourishing lit his days be reverently prolonged the same expression is repeated thrice below foster mother the charactersused in the original of this passage would if they stood alone be of difficult interpretation but comparison with the passage in one account of chronicles which relates the nursing offuki ahezu no mikoto the father of the first earthly emperor jim mu leaves no doubt that the author intended to speak of bathing women attached to the service of the imperial infant the wordsmidzu no wo himo literally rendered fresh small pendant call for some explanation midzu which includes in singlep term the ideas of youth freshness and beauty is here used as an honorific the small pendant is interpreted by mabuchi and motowori to signify the inner girdle which held together the under garment of either sex the old literature of japan teems with allusions to the custom of lovers or spouses making fast each other inner girdle which might not be untied till they met again and the poets perpetually make lover ask some such question as when am far from thee who shall loosen my girdle the translator cannot refrain from here quoting for the benefit of the lover of japanese verse though he will not attempt to translate them the two most graceful of the many stanzas from the collection of myriad leaves brought together by motowori to illustrate this passage wagimoko gayuhiteshi

they led about and amused the august child was by making two forked boat out of two forked cryptomeria from ahidzu in wohari bringing it up and floating it on the pool of ichishi and on the pool of karu in yamato thus leading about and amusing the august child nevertheless the august child spoke never word though his eight grasp beard reached to the pit of his stomach so it was on hearing the cry of high flying swan that he made his first utterance then the heavenly sovereign sent yamanobe no ohotaka this is name of person to catch the bird so this person pursuing the swan arrived in the land of harima from the land of ki and again in his pursuit crossed over to the land of inaba then reaching the land of taniba and the land of tajima thence pursuing round to the eastward he reached the land of afumi and thereupon crossed over into the land of minu and passing along by the land of wohari pursued it into the land of shinanu and at length reaching in his pursuit the land of koshi spread net in the estuary of wanami and having caught the bird brought it up to the capital and presented it to the sovereign so that estuary is called the estuary of wanami it had been thought that on seeing the bird again he would speak but he did not speak as had been thought hereupon the heavenly sovereign deigning to be grieved augustly fell asleep when in an august dream he was instructed saying if thou wilt build my temple like unto thine august abode the august child shall surely speak when he had been thus instructed the heavenly paragraph continues sovereign made grand divination to seek what deity desire this might be then it was discovered that the curse was the august doing of the great deity of idzumo so when about to send the august child to worship at that great deity temple he made divination to discover by whom it were well to have him attended then the lot fell on king ake tatsu so he made king ake tatsu swear saying if there is truly to be an answer to our adoration of this great deity may the heron dwelling on the tree by the pool of sagisu here fall through my oath when he thus spoke the heron that had been sworn by fell to the ground dead again on his commanding it to come to life in answer to his oath it then came to life again moreover he caused to wither by an oath and again brought to life again by an oath broad foliaged bear oak on cape amakashi then the heavenly sovereign granted to prince ake tatsu the name of prince yamato oyu shiki tomi tomi toyo asakura ake tatsu so when the august child was sent off with the two princes prince ake tatsu and prince una kami as his attendants it was divined that if they went out by the nara gate they would meet lame person and blind person if they went out by the ohosaka gate they would likewise meet lame person and blind person and that only the ki gate —a side gate —would be the lucky gate and when they started off they established the homuji clan in every place they arrived at so when they had reached idzumo and had finished worshipping the great deity and were returning up to the capital they made in the middle of the river hi black plaited bridge and respectfully offered temporary palace for the august child to dwell in then when the ancestor of the rulers of the land of idzumo whose name was kihisa tsu mi having made an imitation green leafed mountain placed it in the lower reach of the river and was about to present the great august food the august child spoke saying what here resembles green leafed mountain in the lower reach of the river looks like mountain but is not mountain is it perchance the great court of the deacons who holds in reverence the great deity ugly male of the reed plains that dwells in the temple of so at ihakuma in idzumo thus he deigned to ask then the kings who had been sent in august attendance on him hearing with joy and seeing with delight set the august child to dwell in the palace of nagaho at ajimasa and despatched courier to inform the heavenly sovereign then the august child wedded princess hinaga for one night so on looking privately at the beautiful maiden he found her to be serpent at the sight of which he fled away alarmed then princess hinaga was vexed and illuminating the sea plain pursued after them in ship and they more and more alarmed at the sight pulled the august vessel across the mountain folds and went fleeing up to the capital thereupon they made report saying we have come up to the capital because thy great and august child has become able to speak through worship ping the great deity so the heavenly sovereign delighted forthwith sent king unakami back to build the deity temple thereupon the heavenly sovereign on account of this august child established the totori clan the torikahi clan the homuji clan the ohoyuwe and the wakayuwe from comparison with passage in the chronicles where the same expression occurs one is led to suppose that the craft here mentioned was sort of double boat in each half of which passengers could sit nothing is known of any place called ahidzu in the province of wohari karu has been mentioned in sect lvii note the pool of ihare lit in front of his heart this phrase descriptive of long beard has already occurred at the commencement of sect xii motowori reasonably supposes the characterin this sentence to be copyist error for the emphatic and the translation has been made accordingly the original has the character which is now applied to small species of swan cignus minor pallas cygnus bewickii yarrell but it is uncertain what bird is intended by the author more or less inarticulate utterance is probably meant but the expression in the original is obscure motowori supposes the note in the original to refer only to the word ohotaka while he takes yamamobe to be the name of place already mentioned in sect lxviii note the surname of ohotaka signifying great hawk was according to the same commentator giver to the worthy here mentioned in consequence of the incident related in the text as the bird was not hawk this does not seem very convincing and motowori apparent idea that the man was likened to hawk because he pursued the other bird as hawk would do is extremely far fetched it is moreover doubtful whether the name should not be readoho washi this is mabuchi reading great the chronicles give an altogether different name viz ame no yukata tana no such place is now known the name may be interpreted to mean snare net in allusion to this story as stated in the next sentence of the text the various texts and printed editions all differ slightly in their reading of this passage and from some it might be gathered that the prince did indeed speak as it had been thought that he would do could not speak freely the translation follows motowori emended text literally heart oho kuni nushi the master of the great land the aboriginal monarch of idzumo the descendant of the sun goddess whosep abdication of the sovereignty of japan in favour of the descendant of the sun goddess forms the subject matter of sect xxxii the wordtatari here written with the chinese characterand rendered curse signifies properly the vengeance of spirit either of deity or of the ghost of dead man the word translated doing is literally heart that some such words must be supplied is evident and the translator has followed mabuchi and motowori in supplying them lit king ake tatsu at the divination remember that the original wordukehicombines the meanings of our words wager oath pledge curse etc —being in fact general name for all words to which any mysterious importance attaches lit sign proof sagisu no ike pool in yamato sagi su signifies heron nest the reading of the characters rendered then in this passage has been crux to all the editors fortunately they make no difference to the sense amakashi no saki perhaps amakashi point would be better rendering if as motowori supposes an inland place in the province of yamato is meant it might be the point or extremity of hill or bluff ame kashisignifies literally sweet oak the broad foliaged bear oak mentioned immediately above is supposed by motowori to be the usual evergreen oak and not any special kind the epithet broad foliaged is not as he remarks specially appropriate and he moreover supposes the wordkuma bear to be corruption ofkumiorkumori words which would refer to the thick luxuriance of the foliage the dictionaries do not help us much to decision on the point the component parts of this tremendous name which is happily abbreviated to ake tatsu in the subsequent portions of the text are somewhat obscure especially the wordoyu whose reading rests only on conjecture of motowori who emends the evidently erroneous characterto oyu old toyo luxuriant is an honorific akeandtatsusignify respectively dawn and rise while the rest seem to be names of places of which this prince may be supposed to have been the possessor or the prince of unakami as unakami is the name of place kadzusa shown by divination nara in yamato which is here mentioned for the first time was the capital of japan from to and has always been famous in japanese history and literature the name is derived by the author of the chronicles from the verbnarasu to cause to resound the hosts of the emperor su jin having it is said caused the earth to resound with their trampling when they went out to do battle with haniyasu more probable derivation is fromnara the name of kind of deciduous oak thequercus glandulifera the word rendered gate should possibly be taken simply in the sense of exit or approach or lamepeopleand blind people peculiarly unlucky omen for travellers to whom as motowori remarks sound feet and good eye sight are indispensable to carry them on their way see sect lxiv note in the text the word gate is here by copyist error written moon when the author says that the ki gate gate or exit leading to the province of ki as side gate he means that it was not the one by which travellers would naturally have left the town —the province of ki indeed is to the south of yamato where the capital was whereas the province of idzumo whither they were bound was to the north west this road into ki over matsuchi yama is one famous in the classical poetry of japan homuji be the meaning of the clause is that they granted the surname of homuji to persons in every important locality through which they passed on their journey see sect xviii note the signification of this passage is they built as temporary abode for the prince house in the river hi whether with its foundations actually in the water or on an island is left undetermined connecting it with the main land by bridge made of branches of trees twisted together and with their bark left on them this is here the import of the word black such bridges have been met with by the translator in the remote northern province of deha where the country people call themshiba bashi or rather in their patoissuba bashi twig bridge the traveller is so likely to fall through interstices into the stream below that it is not to be wondered at that they should now be confined to the rudest localities motowori supposeskihisato be the name of place andtsu mito stand as usual fortsu mochi possessor according to which view the name would mean lord or possessor of kihisa no book of reference with which the translator is acquainted throws any light on this curious expression and there is no parallel passage in the chronicles to look for help viz to the prince the august child the preparations whichkihisa tsu miis here said to have made are supposed by motowori to have been prompted by desire to add beauty to the feast but the whole passage is very obscure viz the court in

of the everlasting fragrant tree is what is now called the orange the meaning of this name which is written phonetically both here and in the chronicles has given rise to differences of opinion some deriving it from the name of the province of tajima itself of obscure origin and from the wordmori keeper while others think it comes fromtachibana the japanese word for orange with reference to the story here told the supporters of the former view on the other hand derive thetachibanafromtajima mori miyake no murazhi whethermiyakeis simply the name of place or whether it should be taken in the

timeless the whole of this circumlocution for the orange has indeed to be interpreted by the help of the chronicles it being here written phonetically and offering some difficulties as it stands this corrupt and obscure passage seems to be well restored by motowori whose explanation of it is likewise as convincing as it is ingenious the expression clubmoss oranges signifies oranges as they grow on the branch surrounded by leaves while spear oranges are the same divested of leaves and hanging to the bate twig thus the words clubmoss and spear come to be used as auxiliary numerals for oranges plucked in these two different manners viz says motowori princess hibasu who however according to the account in the chronicles was already dead at this time the wordtachibana written in the text should probably be taken as specific and not as general term in modern usage it designates thecitrus japonica but it is matter of dispute whether the application of the term has not altered since

row counted the days was curiously misunderstood and subjected to various far fetched interpretations there can however be no doubt but that motowori is right —the reason why the old man is said to

to warrant the continuous translation above given the word post though such use of it is very curious must beunderstoodto denote not dead but living trunk or rather the stem of some delicate plant or grass which falls beneath the sickle of the mower on mount kagu in heaven or as it may better be understood on the heavenly mount kagu in yamato gourd shaped is the translation ofhisa kata noorhisa gata no the pillow word for heaven its meaning is disputed but mabuchi in his dictionary of pillow words and motowori agree in giving to it the sense here adopted see the above mentioned paper on the

shite here rendered lifted up words very frequently has the signification of lifting up prayer to some superhuman being in this passage however it conveys no more than its proper etymological meaning viz the god of mount ibuki perhaps hail may be intended by this expression and so motowori decides but this interpretation of the term seems to agree well with the song in sect cxlii the commentators disagree as to whether this note should or should not be considered to form part of the original text motowori so considers it he however in the opinion of the translator is not happy in his

native commentators tzuwe tsuki zaka the pass of leaning on staff it is in the province of ise between yokaichi and ishi yakushi wotsu no saki in the province of ise the name probably signifies harbour of the mountain declivity the former portion of the text tells us nothing either of the meal or of the sword here mentioned this quaintly simple and apparently very ancient poem needs no elucidation in ise mihesignifies three fold this is the literal rendering of the text motowori thinks however that we should understand that there were various swellings on his legs such as would be produced if the limb were tightly tied round with cord in three places nobo unin the province of ise the name seems to signify the moor of mounting the chinese character here used signifies simply thinking of but in such context its common japanese interpretation is loving or regretting and so motowori means us to understand it when he readsshinukashite viz yamato this song and the two following form but one in the pages of the chronicles where they appear with several verbal differences and are attributed not to the prince but to his father the emperor moribe decides that in the latter particular the text of these records gives the preferable account but that the chronicles are right in making the three songs one continuous poem the expression this song is land regretting song strongly supports this view for though we might also render in the plural these songs are etc such translation would be less natural as in similar cases the numeral is used thusp thesetwosongs are etc the expression this is an incomplete song points asdecidedlyto some mutilation of the original document from which the compiler of the records copied this passage taking then the three songs as one the entire drift is that of paean on yamato the poet native land which he could not hope ever to see again —commencing by praising its still seclusion as it lies there behind its barrier of protecting mountains he goes on to mention the rural pleasures enjoyed by those who wandering over the hill sides deck their hair with garlands of leaves and flowers for himself indeed these delights are no more but says he do you ye children full of health and happiness pursue your innocent enjoyment in conclusion he lovingly apostrophises the clouds which rising up from the south west are as it were messengers from home the wordmahoroha rendered secluded is great crux to the commentators and motowori examination of the synonyms of japan pp and moribe idzu no koto waki vol iii should be consulted by the student desirous of forming his own opinion on the point another apparent difficulty is the wordgomoreru whose position in the sentence motowori seems to have misunderstood by following moribe and taking it as compound with the wordawogaki yamaintoawogaki yama gomoreruthe difficulty vanishes and we are likewise relieved from the necessity of supposing anything so highly improbable as that the verbkomoreruwhen not compounded should have commenced with anigori’ed syllable complete signifies healthy mount heguri is preceded in the original bytatamikomo moribe

will never revisit song of loving regret for his native land incomplete song mustbe understood as the designation of poem of certain number of lines viz three and was probably given by comparison with the greater length of poetical compositions in general this poem is an exclamation of distress at the thought of the sword which he had left with his mistress princess miyazu and which if he had had it with him would doubtless have preserved him from the evil influences of the god of mount ibuki which were the beginning ofp his end sabre sword tsurugino tachi is curious expression which moribe thinks means double edged sword next section xc —emperor kei kō part xv —yamato take turns into white bird the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com thereupon his empresses and likewise his august children who dwelt in yamato all went down and built an august mausoleum and forthwith crawling hither and thither in the rice fields encompassing the mausoleum sobbed out song saying thedioscorea quinquelobacrawling hither and thither among the rice stubble among the rice stubble in the rice fields encompassing the mausoleum thereupon the dead prince turning into white dotterel eight fathoms long and soaring up to heaven flew off towards the shore then the empress and likewise the august children though they tore their feet treading on the stubble of the bamboo grass forgot the pain and pursued him with lamentations at that time they sang saying our loins are impeded in the plain over grown with short bamboo grass we are not going through the sky but oh we are on foot again when they entered the salt sea and suffered as they went they sang saying as we go through the sea our loins are impeded —tottering in the sea like herbs growing in great river bed again when the bird flew and perched on the sea side they sang saying the dotterel of the beach goes not on the beach but follows the seaside these four songs were all sung at yamato take august interment so to the present day these songs are sung at the great interment of heavenly sovereign so the bird flew off from that country and stopped at shiki in the land of kafuchi so they made an august mausoleum there and laid yamato take to rest forthwiththat august mausoleum was called by the name of the august mausoleum of the white bird nevertheless the bird soared up thence to heaven again and flew away wives it will be remembered that the historian habitually mentions yamato take as if he had been emperor to the land of ise the drift of the song is comparison of the helpless wanderings of the mourners in the neighbourhood of the tomb to the convolutions of thedioscorea quinqueloba creeping plant growing among the rice in the adjacent fields but there are evidently some lines omitted if we were to adopt the elegant verses conjecturally supplied by moribe the entire translation would run thus thedioscorea quinquelobacrawl hither and thither among the rice stubble among the rice stubble in the rice fields encompassing the mausoleum but though like it we crawl hither and thither and weep and speak to thee thou answerest not word —moribe supposes this poem to be the empress composition and the following three to have proceeded from the children as usual when the word chidori defined as any kind of dotterel plover or sandpiper is used it is doubtful what bird is really intended at the end of this section we are told that the mausoleum was called the mausoleum of the white bird specifically however these characters are used with their sinico japanese pronunciation ofhaku choas the name of the swan but as swans are nowhere else mentioned in these records and as moreover their habits are notp such as to accord with the legend here narrated it will perhaps be safer to retain dotterel in the translation heron also has been suggested the signification of this song is it is easy enough for thee thou bird spirit to fly through the air but remember that we are on foot and that our feet are getting torn by the short stubble of the bamboo grass bambusa shino when the bird flew over the sea they too waded after it through the waves the signification of the song is as we pursue thee through the sea we sink in the waves up to our middles and totter like the water plants against which strikes the current of great river —the worduwe gusa lit herbs planted is curious but it simply means herbs growing as in the translation conf our word plant the latter part of the poem is in the original highly elliptical the point of the song seems to rest on delicate distinction between the wordshama beach andiso seaside which does not obtain in the later japanese language any more than it does in english bothhamaandiso beach and seaside denote the boundary line between sea and land but we must suppose with the commentators that while the former was used with special reference to the land the latter considered the idea so to speak from the point of view of the sea the import of the song is therefore to upbraid the bird for flying over the waves instead of flying along the adjacent shore says motowori from ise not to be confounded with the shiki in yamato which is written with different phonetic character the verb used in the original isshizumeru to repress to quiet to lay to establish hence to build temple to god to worship the grammatical vagueness of the japanese language helps in all this passage to preserve the connection of ideas in manner which it is difficult to render in an english translation using no pronouns it does not require to specialise in each instance whether it is the bird that is meant or yamato take but the two are confounded together in language as they were in thought shira tori no

the sense of thinking as already frequently remarked the japanese mind does not occupy itself much with the distinction to us all important of singular and plural the reason why the translator renders

petitioned the empress saying from this time forward obedient to the heavenly sovereign commands will feed his august horses and will marshal vessels every year nor ever let the vessels keels dry or their poles and oars dry and will respectfully serve him without drawing back while heaven and earth shall last so therefore the land ofshiragi was constituted the feeder of the august horses and the land of kudara was constituted the crossing store then the empress stuck her august staff on the gate of the chieftain of shiragi and having made the rough august spirits of the great deities of the inlet of sumi the guardian deities of the land she laid them to rest and crossed back so while this business was yet unconcluded the child with which she was pregnant was about to be born forthwith in order to restrain her august womb she took stone and wound it round the waist of her august skirt and the august child was born after she had crossed back to the land of tsukushi so the name by which

previous to motowori have king instead of but as the latter character is used in all parallel passages of this work we must attribute the occurrence of the former in this single place to copyist error and accuse the author rather than his commentator of the ill natured degradation of the korean king into mere chieftain more literally master the character which is here used is that employed in speaking of subject addressing his sovereign literally bellies literally with heaven and earth see note the sea store the author means to say that from the land of kudara tribute was to be paid with

floated above the imperial junk to protect it were the gentle august spirits while the rough august spirits presided at the empress feats of arms and kept the enemy in subjection motowori warns us not to fall into the mistake of supposing that the rough and gentle spirits of god were separate individualities they being only according to him various manifestations of the same individuality the student is advised to consult his beautifully written note on the subject of these spirits in vol xxx pp of his commentary see sect note literally established and worshipped motowori says that this mention of their being laid to rest is made with an implied reference to the journey on which the deities in question had accompanied the imperial army he also tries to prove that this laying to rest of the deities must have occurred after the return of the empress to japan as it is not possible to suppose that the gods could find home in foreign land but the wording of the text is against him literally government as motowori suggests she wrapped the stone up and tied it into the waist of her skirt in something resembling sash in south western japan bearing the word however also signifies

king oshikuma having heard of the circumstance thought to waylay her went forth to the moor of toga and hunted for an omen then king kagosaka climbed up an oak tree and then large and angry boar came forth dug up the oak tree and forthwith devoured king kagosaka his younger brother king oshikuma undaunted by this circumstance raised an army and lay in wait for the empress to close with the mourning vessel as being an empty vessel then an army was landed from the mourning vessel and joined in combat with the opposing forces at this time king oshikuma made the noble isahi ancestor of the kishi clan of naniha his generalissimo and on the august side of the heir apparent his augustness naniha ne ko take furu kuma ancestor of the grandees of wani was made generalissimo so when the

old name of the sea and river shore on which now stands the town of ohosaka the name kishi is said by motowori to be properly korean official designation but it is one whose origin is to be sought in china shōgun this is the earliest mention of this office which passing from the military to the political sphere played such great part in the mediaeval and modern history of japan the signification of all the elements of this compound name is not clear but it is partly honorific and descriptive of the bravery of its bearer wani no omi see sect lxii note the text is here somewhat obscure and the

marvellous etymology of this name which the author seems to adopt will be found at the end of the section note the compiler of the chronicles is probably nearer the truth when he derives it fromtsunu ga horned stag for the meaning of this curious expression see sect lx note the commentators give no explanation of this one of the three names of the deity in question it would appear to be made up of word expressive of solicitation and of portion of the heir apparent name thus signifying perhaps come on wake give me thy name with reference to the legend here narrated to which of the two personages of the legend is not clear motowori however prefers to suppose that it was to take uchi as if the prince himself were intended the word dream would probably receive the honorific or reverence thy commands motowori supposes that they were caught by being speared in the nose fish that would naturally have formed part of thine august food is less good to translate by fish formineaugust food as usual the original japanese text has no personal pronouns to guide the reader but though emperors are sometimes made to use the honorific in speaking of themselves this is not the custom in the case of princes and jin is supposed to have not yet assumed the imperial dignity mi ke tsu oho kami motowori mentions several deities of this name who were according to him separate beings kehi no oho kami the meaning of the syllablehi rendered by wondrous in accordance with motowori suggestion is not certain the strand of blood fromchi uramotowori is obliged to derive tsunuga as well as he can in order

august deity suku na biko no who dwells forever in unshaken power and who sendsp it to thee with endless congratulation come on come on drink deeply —some of the expressions in this song are subject of debate among the commentators excepting the clause partake not shallowly in which the translator has adopted the opinion of the author of the explanation of the songs in the chronicles of japan moribe interpretation has been followed throughout the latter critic would identifyasazu not slowly withamasazu without leaving anything but there seems no warrant for supposing such an elision of the syllablesa the use of the expressionkaruhoshiandmotohoshito express reiteration is worthy of notice it will be remembered that the deity mentioned was the microscopic personage who came riding over the waves to share the sovereignty of idzumo with the deity master of the great land see sect xxvii this song signifies such joyful feast must surely have been preceded by joyful distilling of the liquor for it continue to drink oh prince —the commentators disagree on the subject of one or two of the words of this song in which the translator has followed motowori interpretation throughout the words that drum are the chief difficulty motowori supposes that drums being originally unknown in japan were first seen by the japanese on the occasion of the conquest of korea in this very reign and he thinks that the drum would be placed by the side of the mortar during the pounding of the rice out of which the liquor was to be made that drum means the drum belonging to the pounder of the rice

the numerous and prosperous homesteads of the people see the most fertile portion of the country —on this view chiba is identified with toba the name of district and the wordho rendered acme is taken to mean the best highest most showy part of anything for motowori opinion which is that of the older commentators as well thatchi bais pillow word there is much to be said and if we followed it we should have to render the first two lines thus as look on the thousand leafed pueraria moor etc kadzusignifying pueraria motowori explanation ofmomo chi dare here rendered by hundred thousand fold

nushi ya kata hime miya nushiis priestess or more literally temple guardian for the rest of the name see sect xxvi note though the personages are of course meant to be different that day having passed by the emperor came on the next day according to his promise motowori supposes with apparent reason that the character augustness has only crept into the text through the attraction of the following character made which it resembles in appearance it must be understood that in this song the imperial singer commences by referring to what doubtless formed part of the feast —a crab —and thence passes on by an imperceptible transition to allude to his own adventure with the maiden as the crab when alive walked sideways so was the emperor zigzagging up and down the road that lines the shore of lake biwa pursuing his breathless course like that of the busy grebe that perpetually plunges into the water when the maiden met him near kohata beautiful indeed was she her back straight as shield her teeth like row of acorns and the artificial eye brows painted dark colour on her forehead drawn low down in perfect crescent shape she had been careful in selecting the clay to make the paint rejecting the upper layer of earth for that was of too bright red rejecting likewise the lower layer for that was too dark but taking the middle which was of the correct blue tint and drying it not in the fierce but in mildly tempered sun light and now this maiden for whom his heart had been panting and turning this way and that ever since the previous day is actually seated opposite to him nay at his very side and he is feasting in her sweet company —tsunuga is the name of place in the province of echizen far distant is an imperfect attempt at rendering the force of the pillow wordmomo dzutafu which implies that the traveller must pass through hundred other places before reaching his destination whither reaches its sideward motion signifies whither is it going with its sideward motion ichiji shima and mishima are places of which nothing is known so that the allusion to them is obscure at this point motowori interpretation diverges from that of moribe which has been followed throughout sasanami here rendered wavelets is taken by him as by the older commentators as the name of place and the description of the maiden teeth is misunderstood to signify that she had beak filled with row of teeth like the water caltrop motowori also would here divide the song in two proceeding for which there is not sufficient warrant on other minor points too his decisions do not seem so happy as moribe the view of both commentators will be found at length in motowori commentary vol xxxii pp and in moribe idzu no kato waki in loco three chestnuts mitsu guri no is common pillow word

augustly sang saying come on children oh the fragrant flowering orange tree on my way as go to pluck the wild garlic —to pluck the garlic —has its uppermost branches withered by birds perching on them and its lowest branches withered through people plucking from them but the budding fruit on the middle branch like three chestnuts —the ruddy maiden oh if thou lead her off with thee it will be good

summoned her up the same phrase occurs immediately below mabuchi thinks that august child should be substituted for the reading in the text but motowori insists that the title translated heir apparent was anciently borne by all the sons of an emperor and that consequently no emendation is called for the emperor orders the native term translated copious feast istoyo no akari variously written with the characters etc etc it literally signifies copious brightness in allusion to the ruddy glow which wine gives to the faces of the revellers and henceforward perpetually recurs in this history in later times it specifically denoted the festival of the tasting of the first rice but anciently its meaning was not thus limited motowori note on the subject in vol xxxii pp of his commentary may be consulted with advantage an oak leaf which was used as cup to sip out of leaf plattersp for food have already been mentioned motowori says that the wordkashika properly the name of deciduous oak thequercus dentata was employed to denote any kind of leaf thus used the whole gist of this song is contained in the last three lines the ruddy maiden oh if thou lead her off with thee it will be good —i thou and the maiden will form fitting couple all that goes before is what is technically called preface though its bearing is so clear as to admit of translation and even in english to form an appropriate introduction to the song —it is not the stinking garlic but the fragrant orange that the singer has met by the way and it is the choicest young fruit in the very middle of the tree that forms suitable comparison for the lovely young girl —with the favourite allusion to upper middle and lower the reader is already familiar and the pillow word three chestnuts was explained in the note on theprecedingsong sect cvi note the gist of the song is knew not that thou my son hadst conceived secret passion for the maiden but am now conscious of my own mistake and my foolish old heart is ashamed of itself with this explanation the elaborate comparison between the state of the monarch mind and the condition of the peasant driving piles for the foundation of dyke and having his feet either lacerated by the stumps of the water caltrop or made slimy by brushing against the roots of thebrasenia peltataat the bottom of the water becomes intelligible and appropriate —the wordkuri rendered roots perplexed motowori who suggests that it may be but second name of thebrasenia appended to the first but moribe suggestion that it is to be identified withkori and taken in the signification of roots though not quite convincing is at least more plausible the text of this song is corrupt in these records and has to be corrected by comparison with that of the chronicles moribe goes into an amusing ecstasy over the picture of ancient manners which it presents and lauds the simplicity of days when father and son could so peacefully woo the same maiden without mutual concealment or disastrous consequences the meaning of this song is at first heard of the maiden of kohada in the furthest parts of himuka as one hears the distant thunder but now she is mine and we sleep locked in each other arms —this kohada in himuka must not be confounded with the kohata in yamashiro mentioned in the preceding section the back of the road means the remotest portion conf sect lx note the thunder must be understood to refer to very faint and distantp sound the prince had first heard of the maiden vaguely but now she is his and has been his for some time for this song must be supposed to have been composed after the occasion of the feast with the story of which it is here connected the meaning of this song is love this maiden of kohada in himuka who disputed not my

’tis like the icicles on the plants that cluster about the trunks of the dead trees in winter almost every line however excepting those giving the name and title of the prince is subject of controversy and the gō gan shō in locoand motowori commentary vol xxxiii pp should be consulted for keichiū mabuchi and motowori views on the disputed point —the expression solar august child signifies sun descended prince in allusion to the supposed descent of the japanese monarchs from the sun goddess yoko usuoryokusu it is not plain what sort of mortar the author intended to designate by this term motowori supposes it to mean broad flat mortar in contradistinction to high and narrow one keichiū sview which he quotes to the effect that it was mortar that had been carved out of the block against the grain of the wood seems an equally good guess where all is guess work in the song this same name is readkashinofu but the commentators tell us that the genitive particleno of is simply inserted for the sake of rhythm and it is not unlikely that they are right the name seems to signify place where oak trees grow see sect xviii note the character rendered by distil or brew

conformity with the heavenly sovereign commands ceded the empire to uji no waki iratsuko thereupon his augustness ohoyama mori disobeying the heavenly sovereign commands and anxious in spite thereof to obtain the empire had the design to slay the prince his younger brother secretly raised an army and prepared to attack him then his augustness oho sazaki hearing that his elder brother had prepared an army forthwith despatched messenger to apprise uji no waki iratsuko so startled at the news the latter set troops in ambush by the river bank and likewise after having drawn fence of curtains and raised tent on the top of the hill placed there publicly on throne one of his retainers to pretend that he was the king the manner in which all the officials reverentially went and came being just like that usual in the king presence and moreover preparing for the time when the king his elder brother should cross the river he arranged and decorated boat and oars and moreover ground in mortar the root of thekadzura japonica and having taken the slime of its juice rubbed therewith the grating inside the boat so as to make any who should tread on it fall down and then himself put on cloth coat and trowsers and having assumed the appearance of common fellow stood in the boat holding the oar hereupon when the king his elder brother having hid his troops in ambush and put on armour beneath his clothes reached the river bank and was about to get into the boat he gazed at the grandly decorated place on the hill thought the king his younger brother was sitting on the throne being altogether ignorant of the fact that he was standing in the boat holding the oar and forthwith asked the fellow who was holding the oar saying it has been reported to me that on this mountain there is large and angry boar wish to take that boar shall peradventure get that boar then the fellow holding the oar replied saying thou canst not again he asked saying for what reason the boat man answered saying he is not to be got however often and in however many places he be chased wherefore say that thou canst not catch him either when they had crossed as far as the middle of the river prince uji no waki iratsuko caused the boat to be tilted over and his elder brother to fall into the water then forthwith he rose to the surface and floated down with the current forthwith as he floated he sang saying whoever is swiftest among the boatmen of the uji ferry will come to me thereupon the troops that had been hidden on the river bank rose up simultaneously on this side and on that side and fixing their arrows in their bows let him go floating down so he sank on reaching kawara paragraph continues point so on their searching with hooks the place where he had sunk the hooks struck on the armour inside his clothes and made rattling sound so the place was called by the name of kawara point then when they hooked up his bones the younger king sang saying catalpabow evonymusstanding by the ferry bank of uji my heart had thought to cut you my heart had thought to take you but at the base methought of the lord at the extremity methought of the younger sister grievously methought of this sorrowfully methought of that and came back without cutting it —thecatalpabow theevonymus so the bones of his augustness oho yama mori were buried on the nara mountain his augustness oho yama mori was the ancestor of the dukes of hijikata the dukes of heki and the dukes of harihara this is the only passage in the work where this expression occurs uji no waki iratsukois the personage thus designated the same expression has been in sect xxxi near note rendered couch the characters in the original areor uji na maki iratsuko the chinese phrase the hundred officials is here used his augustness oho yama mori the text has the character which in combination with the preceding words oars gives the sense of oarsman boatman but motowori reasonably suggests that it is an error for the grass hand forms of the two characters closely resembling each other andmaking much better sense for who would talk of decorating an oarsman bamboo grating literally that king son it must be understood that uji no waki iratsuko and his men having planned to act thus were on their guard and did not fall into the water as did oho yama mori who was taken unawares this is motowori view of the meaning of the song which he interprets as request for help to some friendly boatman moribe adopts quite different view and thinks that the drowning prince is rather giving vent to sentiments of pride and defiance he says speaking in the prince name it is not that have been capsized out of the boat into the river but that am swimming off after pole which has fallen into the water if there be any strong and willing fellows among my partizans let them swim after me it must be explained that the word rendered boatmen in the translation is literally pole takers or according to moribe view to take pole motowori interpretation seems to do less violence to the wording of the original and moribe has not even the merit of accounting for the use of the futurekomuwhere the imperativekonewould be what we should naturally expect —ujiis preceded by the in this context untranslatable pillow wordchihayaburu see dictionary of pillow words kawara no saki the author in the next sentence derives this name from the rattling sound made by the books as they struck on the armour but there seems great deal to be said in favour of arawi hakuseki view thatkawarais an old word itself signifying armour the wordkagihere used occurs elsewhere to denote the hooks employed for fastening doors and in later times took the specific meaning of key literally soundedkawara the text has the characters but motowori says thatstands for and that we must interpret the passage to mean that they scratched about to find and take out his corpse the signification of this song is came here meaning to kill thee as might cut down and kill thatcatalpatree thatevonymus growing on the river bank but the thought of our father and of thy sister or wife touched me with pity and return without having drawn my bow at thee —uji is preceded by the untranslatable pillow wordchihayahito see dictionary of pillow words —motowori reads itchihaya hitowithout thenigori —the wordsadzusa yumi ma yumi here respectively rendered catalpabow and evonymus are difficult and the doubt as to whether we should understand the prince to be speaking simply of the trees or to intend likewise to allude to his bow which was made of the wood of one of those trees is probably not to be settled as thewordsin question have always oscillated between the twop meanings and here evidently contain double allusion motowori thinks that the first of the two forms only sort of pillow word for the second —the word rendered bank in accordance with moribe suggestion is literally reach —no special importance must be attached to the expressions base or main part and extremity though they may doubtless be thought to allude to the father and sister the recollection of whom softened the victorious younger brother heart the wordiranakeku rendered grievously is of not quite certain interpretation —it must be understood that though by overturning the boat uji no waki iratsuko did constructively cause oho yama mori death he did not actually shoot at and slay him when in the water but followed down the river side lamenting over what had happened —this song is singled out by moribe for special praise see sect lxxii note tohotafumi tōtōmi in the

fisherman wept from the fatigue of going backwards and forwards so the proverb says paragraph continues ah the fisherman weeps on account of his own things ameanwhile uji no waki iratsuko died early

accept the imperial dignity or some fishermen and similarly in the plural throughout came to present fish to his majesty amotowori is probably right in saying that the point of this proverb lies in the consideration that whereas people in general weep for that which they have not this fisherman wept on account of the trouble which was caused to him by the fish which he had or died first the use in this place of the character properly confined to the meaning of the death of an emperor is remarkable see motowori observations on the point in vol xxxiii pp next section cxiv —emperor jin part xi —ama no hi boko crosses over to japan the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com moreover of old there had been man called by the name of ama no hi boko child of the ruler of

bank of this lagoon certain poor girl was taking her midday sleep tunc solis radii coelesti arcui similes in privatas partes impegerunt again there was certain poor man who thinking this occurrence bstrange constantly watched the woman behaviour so the woman having conceived from the time of that midday sleep gave birth to red jewel then the poor man who had watched her begged to be allowed to take the jewel and kept it constantly wrapped up by his side this person having planted rice field in valley had loaded cow with food for the labourers and was getting into the middle of the valley when he met the ruler son ama no hi boko who thereupon asked him saying why enterest thou the valley with load of food upon cow thou wilt surely kill this cow and eat her forthwith he seized the man and was about to put him into prison when the man replied saying was not going to kill the cow was simply taking food to the people in the fields but still the ruler child would not let him go then he undid the jewel which hung at his side and therewith bribed the ruler child so the latter let the poor man go brought the jewel home and placed it beside his couch forthwith it was trans formed into beautiful maiden whom he straightway wedded and made his chief wife then the maiden perpetually prepared all sorts of dainties with which she constantly fed her husband so the ruler child grew proud in his heart and reviled his wife but the woman said am not woman who ought to be the wife of such as thou will go to the land of my ancestors —and forthwith she secretly embarked in boat and fled away across here to japan and landed at naniha this is the deity called princess akaru who dwells in the shrine of hime goso at naniha thereupon ame no hi boko hearing of his wife flight forthwith pursued her across hither and was about to arrive at naniha when the deity of the passage prevented his entrance so he went back again and landed in the country of tajima or according to motowori reading ame no hi boko the characters in the next signify heavenly sun spear but the homonymous characters with which the name is written in the gleanings from ancient story and which are approved of both by motowori and by tanigaha shisei signify fisherman chamaecyparis spear apparently nothing more is meant than that there was alagoon but still theone in this context is curious and motowori

plural does not occupy the japanese mind and eight and eight fold are taken to mean much the same thing in the following sentence we find these eight deities or this eight fold deity spoken of in such

the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com so this deity had daughter whose name was the deity maiden of idzushi so eighty deities wished to obtain this maiden of idzushi in marriage but none of them could do so hereupon there were two deities brothers of whom the elder was called the youth of the glow on the autumn mountains and the younger was named the youth of the haze on the spring mountains so the elder brother said to the younger brother though beg for the maiden of idzushi cannot obtain her in marriage wilt thou be able to obtain her he answered saying will easily obtain her then the elder brother said if thou shalt obtain this maiden will take off my upper and lower garments and distil liquor in jar of my own height and prepare all the things of the mountains and of the rivers and give them to thee in payment of the wager then the younger brother told his mother everything that the elder brother had said forthwith the mother having taken wistaria fibre wove and sewed in the space of single night an upper garment and trowsers and also socks and boots and likewise made bow and arrows and clothed him in this upper garment trowsers etc made him take the bow and arrows and sent him to the maiden house where both his apparel and the bow and arrows all turned into wistaria blossoms thereupon the youth of the haze on the spring mountains hung up the bow and arrows in the maiden privy then when the maiden of idzushi thinking the blossoms strange brought them home the youth of the haze on the spring mountains followed behind the maiden into the house and forthwith wedded her so she gave birth to child then he spoke to his elder brother saying have obtained the mayden of idzushi thereupon the elder brother vexed that the younger brother should have wedded her did not pay the things he had wagered then when the younger brother complained to his mother his august parent replied saying during my august life the deities indeed are to be well imitated moreover it must be because he imitates mortal men that he does not pay those things forthwith in her anger with her elder child she took jointed bamboo from an island in the river idzushi and made coarse basket with eight holes and took stones from the river and mixing them with brine wrapped them in the leaves of the bamboo and caused this curse to be spoken like unto the becoming green of these bamboo leaves do thou become green and wither again like unto the flowing and ebbing of this brine do thou flow and ebb again like unto the sinking of these stones do thou sink and be prostrate having caused this curse to be spoken she placed the basket over the smoke therefore the elder brother dried up withered sickened and lay prostrate for the space of eight years so on the elder brother entreating his august parent with lamentations and fears she forthwith caused the curse to be reversed thereupon his body became sound as it had been before this is the origin of the term divine wager payment idzushi wotome no kami literally eighty deities wished to obtain this maiden of idzushi but none could wed her but the sense is that given in the translation ahi yama no shita bi wotoko the explanation of the name is that given by motowori following mabuchi who sees in it reference to the ruddy brilliance of the leaves which is so marked feature of the japanese woods in autumn the chinese characters used have indeed the signification of the lower ice of the autumn mountains but lower ice may well be simply phonetic in this case haru yamu no kasumi wotoko in japanesekohedomo written with the characters perhaps motowori is right in supposing this verb to have been originally identical withkofuru to love whose corresponding form iskofuredomo if so the author may have meant to make his hero say though love the maiden etc but it is better to be guided by the characters and to suppose that he referred to the request made to her mother to grant her to him literally compute the height of my person and distil liquor in jar all the valuable produce of the chase and of the fisheries such as are perpetually mentioned in the shinto rituals as being presented to the gods thus in the service of the goddess of food see mr satow translation in vol vii pt iv of these transactions we read that the worshipper offered as to things which dwell in the mountains—things soft of hair and things rough of hair as to things which grow in the great field plain sweet herbs and bitter herbs as to things which dwell in the blue sea plain—things wide of fin and things narrow of fin down to weeds of the offing and weeds of the shore literally one child the japanese original of the words here unavoidably rendered by mortal men in order to mark the antithesis to the word deities has been more literally translated by living people in an earlier passage of the work see sect ix note the signification of the entire sentence is during my lifetime thy brother should be careful to imitate the upright conduct of the gods for if instead of doing so he be dishonest and untruthful as are the sons of men it will be at his own peril or according to the more usual reading one jointed bamboo but in either case the meaning is obscure motowori who adopts the reading that has been followed in the translation suggests that the expression may simply be periphrasis for the bamboo in general motowori remarks that the word eight in thisp place where to indicate considerable number we should rather expect eighty is curious and he surmises thatmay be an error for large the word coarse itself is sufficient to show that the apertures left in the plaiting of the basket were large scil of which the basket was woven scil by her younger son in this case as motowori remarks it is the sea water that is intended to be spoken of whereas the allusion in the previous sentence is to hard salt but the japanese language uses the same word for both and the same chinese character is here also used in both contexts for this curseconf sect xl note et seq and sect xli scil of the furnace kitchen in the younger brother house as motowori suggests the text has the character which signifies to wither or dry up spoken of trees but the translator agrees with motowori in considering it to be in all probability an error for to be prostrate and in any case it could not here be rendered by either of the verbs dry up or wither without introducing into the english version tautology which does not exist in the japanese original such seems to be the meaning of the obscure originalsono tokohi do wo kahesashimeki motowori would understand it in rather more specialized sense to signify that she caused the implement of the curse the basket to be taken away

chamberlain at sacred texts com thereupon the heavenly sovereign ascending lofty mountain and looking on the land all round spoke saying in the whole land there rises no smoke the land is all poverty stricken so remit all people taxes and forced labour from now till three years hence therefore the great palace became dilapidated and the rain leaked in everywhere but no repairs were made the rain that leaked in was caught in troughs and the inmates removed from its reach to places where there was no leakage when later the heavenly sovereign looked on all the land the smoke was abundant in the land so finding the people rich he now exacted taxes and forced labour therefore the peasantry prospered and did not suffer from forced labour so in praise of that august reign it was called the reign of the emperor sage motowori reading of this verb in the imperative mood as if containing an order addressed by the monarch to his ministers seems less natural than the order reading in the indicative which accordingly the translator has followed there is uncertainty as to the exact character in the original but the older editions read it as the japanese wordhako boxes while motowori prefershi tubes troughs seems to conciliate both views and to be also appropriate to the use mentioned in the text or simply the people but the expressionis generally used in japanese of the peasantry only if following most texts we omitted the final character reign the english translation would be in praise of that august reign the heavenly sovereign was called the emperor sage next section cxxii —emperor nin toku part iv —he loves princess kuro the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com his empress her augustness iha no hime was exceedingly jealous so the concubines employed by the heavenly sovereign could not even peep inside the palace and if anything happened the empress stamped with jealousy then the heavenly sovereign hearing of the regular beauty of princess kuro daughter of the suzerain of ama in kibi and having sent for her employed her but she afraid of the empress jealousy fled down to her native land the heavenly sovereign gazing from an upper story upon princess kuro departure by boat upon the sea sang saying in the offing there are rows of small boats my wife masadzuko of kurozaki goes down towards her native land so the empress was very angry on hearing this august song and sent people to the great strand to drive princess kuro ashore and chase her away on foot thereupon the heavenly sovereign for love of princess kuro deceived the empress saying that he wanted to see the island of ahaji and when he made his progress and was in the island of ahaji he gazing afar sang saying when having departed from the point of wave beaten naniha look at the country —the island of aha the is land of onogoro and also the island of ajimasa are visible the island of saketsu is visible forthwith passing on from that island he made progress to the land of kibi then her augustness princess kuro made him grandly reside at place among the mountain fields and presented to him great august food when for this purpose she plucked cabbage in that place to boil into great august soup the heavenly sovereign went to the place where the maiden was plucking the cabbage and sang saying oh how delightful it is to pluck with person of kibi the cabbage sown in the mountain fields when the heavenly sovereign made his progress up princess kuro presented an august song saying even though the west wind blow up towards yamato and the clouds part and we be separated shall forget thee again she sang saying whose spouse is it that goes towards yamato whose spouse is it that creeps from beneath like hidden water motowori shows by collating various passages in other ancient works that this is the probable signification of the curious expression inp the original kotodateba for the reference of course is to the occurrence of anything noteworthy among the concubines such as the birth of son etc kuro hime black princess probably meaning black haired princess kibi no ama no atahe of this family nothing is known amasignifies fisherman kibiis the name of province thus interpreted according to moribe the general sense of the song is quite clear the wordmasadzuko considered by moribe to be one of the names of princess kuro is however not so understood by motowori who is inclined to see in it rather an honorific description of her kurozakilikewise black cape the wordkuroseemingly containing an allusion to the name of the princess is but the best of many emendations of the name as it stands in the text viz furozaya see motowori commentary vol xxxv for all the possible emendations proposed by him or his predecessors scil of the neighbourhood of naniha or possibleoho ura great strand should be taken as the name of place though motowori does not suggest such view to make her perform the journey on foot see sect note moribe commenting on the import of this song says though the alleged reason was tour of inspection it was truly out of love for princess kuro that the monarch had undertaken the journey when her vessel could no longer be descried he could still alas see the islands that remained behind —the island of aha and the island of ajimasa he could still alas see the islands of onogoro and saketsu alas for him left alone parted

the islands of aha and onogoro see respectively sect iv note and sect iii note of the islands of ajimasa and saketsu nothing is known ajimasais the name of species of palm thelivistona sinensis and motowori supposes that one of the islands in that neighbourhood may anciently have received its name from the palm trees growing on it palms of any kind are however not very common in japan and seem only to grow when specially cultivated motowori thinks we should in this place understand the wordyamagata foryama agata as the name of place but in the songp which immediately follows it must certainly be taken in its etymological sense of mountain fields and it seems therefore quite inconsistent to translate it differently here moreover it is allowed that no such place as yamagata in kibi is anywhere made mention of the import of this song is perfectly clear the person of kibi being of course the imperial poet lady love was about to start back to the capital which was in the province of settsu this honorific seems so out of place seeing that it is not applied to the emperor own songs given in this section that it is supposed by the commentators to be an erroneous addition to the text we might also translate thus even though we be separated as the clouds that part owing to the west wind blowing up towards yamato etc —for the initial lines of the poem which contain the allusion to the wind and to the clouds are simply preface and their import may therefore at will be either considered separately or else made continuous with that of the rest of the poem the meaning of this song is whose spouse is it that returns to yamato whose spouse is it that comes thus secretly to make love to me like stream flowing underground —the allusion contained in the twice repeated words whose spouse is of course to the empress the poetess full of tenderness or the emperor regrets for his sake as well as for her own that he should be the husband of so jealous wife hidden water is the accepted interpretation of the pillow wordkontoridzu no which is with apparent reason supposed to be contraction ofkomori midzu no next section cxxiii emperor nin toku part —the empress retires to yamashiro the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com after this time the empress made progress to the land of ki in order to pluck aralia leaves for copious feast and in the mean while the heavenly sovereign wedded yata no waki iratsume hereupon when the empress was returning in her august vessel loaded full of aralia leaves coolie from kozhima in the land of kibi who was in the service of the superintendent of the water directors being on his way off to his own country met at the great passage of naniha the vessel of lady of the train who had got behind and forthwith told her saying the heavenly sovereign has recently wedded yata no waki iratsume and plays with her day and night it must probably be because the empress has not heard of this thing that she quietly makes progress for pleasure then the lady of the train having heard this narrative forthwith pursued and reached the august vessel and reported everything exactly as the coolie had told it hereupon the empress greatly vexed and angry threw away into the sea all the aralia leaves which she had put on board the august vessel so the place where she did so is called by the name of cape mitsu forthwith without entering the palace but taking her august vessel from it and ascending the channel against the current she made progress up into yamashiro by the river at this time she sang saying oh the river of yamashiro where the seedlings grow in succession as ascend ascend the river oh on the bank of the river there stands growing asashibu —asashibu tree below it stands growing broad foliaged five hundred fold branching true camellia tree oh he who is brilliant like its blossoms widely powerful like its foliage is the great lord forthwith going round by yamashiro and arriving at the entrance of thenaramountain she sang saying oh the river of yamashiro where the seedlings grow in succession as ascend ascend to miya pass nara pass yamato with its shield of mountains and the

which make no sense and motowori following mabuchi reasonably emends it to recently just now mitsu no saki mitsu signifying three is supposed by the author to refer to the three cornered leaves of the

are told that the place was calledkashiha no watari oak passage going on up the river without stopping at naniha where the palace was jr the artificial bed of the river mentioned in sect cxx note the

camellia tree wide spreading and full of blossoms ah how the sight of the sturdy brilliant beauty of this camellia tree brings back my lord and master to my mind —it must be remembered that in japan the camellia trees grow to size far superior to that reached by their representatives in europe tsuginefu rendered according to the view taken by motowori and moribe by the phrase where the seedlings grow in succession is the pillow word for yamashiro and its import is disputed the interpretation here adopted considers it to refer to the regular succession of young trees planted on mountain side when tract of older timber has been cut down mabuchi in his dictionary of pillow words sees in it on the contrary reference to the rising of peak upon peak in mountainous district tsugi ne fu— both interpretations rest on the connection between this term andyama the first half of the name of the province of yamashiro which it qualifies fivehundred fold branching and true are ornamental epithets applied by the poetess to the camellia tree moribe would take the syllablema true in the sense ofha leaf but this seems less good for the straight road from naniha in settsu to nara in yamato would have taken her through the province of kafuchi and not through yamashiro the pass or hill leading from the district of sagara in yamashiro to nara in yamato for nara see sect lxxii note this song expresses the empress desire to return to her parental house at takamiya in the district of kadzuraki —a desire which however her restless frame of mind did not allow her to fulfil —the pillow word for yamashiro which here recurs has already been discussed in note there are two other pillow words in this song —awoniyoshi which is prefixed to nara andwo date orwo date yamaaccording to the old reading orwo date tatsuaccording to another reading which is prefixed to yamato the former of these is so obscure that rather than attempt to render it into english the translator prefers to refer the student to the remarks of the various commentators —mabuchis in his dictionary of pillow words motowori in his commentary vol xxxvi pp and moribein loco wodate yama seems to refer undoubtedly to the circle of mountains that guard the approach to the province of yamato and it has been rendered accordingly the great difficulty of the song lies in the line rendered ascend to miya and the commentators from keichiū downwards make all sorts of efforts to explain it moribe view according to which the word should be regardedp as familiar abbreviation of takamiya naturally used by one whose native place it was seems the most acceptable motowori takes the line to signify when ascend past the palace of naniha korea fornuri no omi the grandee of nuri nuri is probably corrupt form of some korean name or tsudzuki in yamashiro etymology obscure next section cxxiv —emperor nin toku part vi —he follows the empress into yamashiro the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com the heavenly sovereign having heard that the empress had made progress up by yamashiro made person —a retainer called by the name of toriyama —give an august song which said reach her in yamashiro toriyama reach her reach her ah wilt thou reach and meet my beloved spouse again he continued by despatching kuchiko grandee of wani and sang saying wilt thou be without thinking even of the heart that is in the moor of ohowiko the moor of ohowiko that is by takaki at mimoro again he sang saying if indeed had pillowed my head on the white arm like the whiteness of the roots the great roots that were beaten with wooden hoes by the women of yamashiro where the seedlings grow in succession then mightest thou say know thee not so when the grandee of kuchiko was repeating this august song to the empress it was raining heavily then upon his without avoiding the rain coming and prostrating himself at the front door of the palace she on the contrary went out at the back door and on his coming and prostrating himself at the back door of the palace she on the contrary went out at the front door then as he crept backwards and forwards on his knees in the middle of the court the streams of water reached to his loins owing to the grandee being clad in garment dyed green and with red cord the streams of water brushed against the red cord and the green all changed to red colour now the grandee of kuchiko younger sister princess kuchi was in the service of the empress so princess kuchi sang saying oh how tearful is my lord elder brother saying things in the palace of tsutsuki in yamashiro then when the empress asked the reason she replied saying he is my brother the grandee of kuchiko thereupon the grandee of kuchiko and also his younger sister princess kuchi and likewise nurinomi all three took counsel together and sent to report to the heavenly sovereign saying the reason of the empress progress is that there are some insects reared by nurinomi —strange insects changing in three ways once becoming creeping insects once becoming cocoons and once becoming flying birds —and it is only to go and look at them that she has entered into nurinomi house she has no strange intentions when they had thus reported the heavenly sovereign said that being so want to go and see these insects as paragraph continues think they must be strange and with these words he made progress up from the great palace when he entered into nurinomi house nurinomi had already presented to the empress the three fold insects reared by him then the heavenly sovereign augustly stood at the door of the palace where the empress dwelt and sang saying pure as the great roots that were beaten with their wooden hoes by the women of yamashiro where the seedings grow in succession —it is because thou spokest tumultuously that come in here with my retainers numerous as the more and more flourishing trees that look across at these six songs by the heavenly sovereign and by the empress are changing songs which are quiet songs this name signifies bird mountain the commentators presume that it contains an allusion to the fact of its bearer being an imperial courier this is the actual sense conveyed by the original and we naturally infer that toriyama was made the bearer to the empress of the following song the song itself however is addressed not to her but to toriyama on his departure on the other hand the two poems which follow are evidently for the empress and it is impossible to suppose that the first messenger was not likewise intended to convey to her some poetic missive all that we can do is to render the text as it stands and to suppose it corrupt the meaning of this song is toriyama pursue her into yamashiro tremble at the thought of the possibility of thy not finding her wani no omi kuchiko further on he is mentioned askuchiko no omi the grandee of kuchiko kuchi komay be interpretedp to mean mouth child and moribe thinks that this personage was so called on account of the verbal messages of which he was made the bearer the translator would prefer to considerkoas an abbreviation ofhiko prince especially as the sister name iskuchi hime where the word hime must mean princess this song is so obscure that motowori and moribe differ completely as to its interpretation the translator has followed moribe though by no means persuaded that the latter has hit on the proper signification according to this view the emperor makes pun on the word heart which is supposed to have been the name of pool situated on the moor of ohowiko near takaki at mimoro —all names of places with which the empress was familiar —and reproaches her for having no thought of his heart which beats so lovingly for her motowori on the other hand thinks that the poem proper consists only of its last two lines in the english translation they necessarily come first wilt thou be without thinking even of the heart —and that all the rest is preface to the pillow wordkimo mukafuby which the wordkokoro heart is preceded as foroho wi koandtakaki they are taken not as names of places but as common nouns according to this view of the structure of the song it ceases with the exception of its last two lines to have any rational signification and it is needless to attempt to translate it for the english reader persons familiar with japanese are therefore referred to motowori commentary vol xxxvi pp the meaning of this song is if thou and had not so long been spouses then indeed mightest thou break with me and declare that thou knowest me not but how canst thou so far forget our wedded life as to desert me now the great root oho ne is the moderndai kon raphanus sativus kind of radish which is favourite vegetable with the japanese and is distinguished by its brilliantly white appearance beaten here signifies dug up the use of the past tense is curious ko guha here in accordance with motowori view rendered wooden hoes is interpreted by moribe to mean little hoes where the seedlings grow in succession is the english rendering oftsugi ne fu the pillow word for yamashiro see sect cxxiii note the empress was lodging with private individual but her presence warrants the application of the term palace to his house it was raining too hard for the water to stop on the surface in the shape of puddles so it streamed off in little rivulets literally rubbed see introductionp xxx instead of green we might equally well translate by blue the garment intended must be the upper garment or coat kuchi hime literally respectfully served the empress the meaning of these lines which can only be called poetry because they are in metre is plain in them the speaker draws the empress attention to the pitiful condition of the messenger who is doing his best to deliver to her the emperor message probably the reading in our text has been corrupted for that in the chronicles which may be translated thus oh how tearful am when see my lord elder brother etc is much preferable scil of her attendant thus taking the messenger part literally colours this is motowori conjectural restoration of the reading of this word which in all the texts is hopelessly corrupt according to another reading flying insects she is not meditating any evil conduct the song consists of two divisions the first of which is but preface for the second the pivot being formed by the wordsawa sawa ni which has the meaning of pure cool or refreshing with reference to what precedes it and the meaning of tumultuously sawasawa ni—sawagaskiku when taken together with what follows the difficulties which present themselves in the first division have all been explained in note to the lastandnote to the present section the general sense of the second division is plain enough but the precise application of the comparison to the more and more flourishing tree is obscure motowori view has been adopted by the translator and the words in brackets supplemented accordingly moribe prefers to consider that the reference is to the repeated visits first of the emperor messengers and afterwards of the emperor himself the words look across at must be explained by supposing that the trees were in the neighbourhood of nurinomi house they were shoots springing up from roots that had been cut down close to the ground the commentators thus explain these obscure expressions quiet song is one which is sung to tranquil tune changing song is one temporarily sung while the tone mode is changing the six songs in question must be supposed to have combined both characteristics next

iratsume replied in song saying even though the one sedge stem of yata be alone if the great lord say it is right even though it be alone it is right so the yata tribe was established as the august proxy of yata no waki iratsume in this song the emperor condoles with his mistress on her childlessness will the single sedge on the moor of yata die without leaving any offspring sedge indeed yes

spoke to king hayabusa wake saying owing to the violence of the empress the heavenly sovereign has not deigned to take yata no waki iratsume into the palace so will not respectfully serve him will become the wife of thine augustness forthwith they wedded each other wherefore king hayabusa wake made no report to the heavenly sovereign then the heavenly sovereign going straight to the place where queen medori dwelt stood on the door sill of the palace hereupon queen medori being at her loom was weaving garments then the heavenly sovereign sang saying oh for whom may be the garments that my great lady medori weaves queen medori replied in song saying for an august veil for the high going falcon lord so the heavenly sovereign perceiving her feelings returned into the palace at this time when her husband king hayabusa wake came his wife queen medori sang saying the lark flies to heaven oh high going falcon lord catch the wren the heavenly sovereign hearing this song forthwith raised an army wishing to slay king hayabusa and queen medori who then fled away together and ascended mount kurahashi thereupon king hayabusa wake sang saying owing to the steepness of ladder like mount kurahashi being unable to clamber up the rocks oh she takes my hand again he sang saying though ladder like mount kurahashi bep steep it is not steep when ascend it with my younger sister so when they fled thence and reached soni in uda the imperials army pursued overtook and slew them scil of the success of his mediation or for whom is the loom employed with which my great lady medori weaves —the wordhatain archaic japanese signifies both garment and the instrument which is used to weave garment loom and in later times the second meaning has prevailed to the exclusion of the first there is here play on the name of the queen paramour hayabusa wake which signifies falcon lord as in the translation—the parallel passage of the chronicles gives these two songs as single one which is put into the mouth of queen medori handmaidens —is more acceptable version of the incident motowori suspects that there is here an error in the text which should according to him read after this the gist of this song is an instigation to murder the emperor whose name wasoho sazaki great wren conf sect civ note addressed to the singer husband whose name washayabusa wake falcon lord but the allusion to the lake remains obscure keichiū suggests that it is simply mentioned as term of comparison for the falcon power of flight while motowori opines that the meaning rather is the lark flies so high up to heaven that it would be hard to catch it but the wren is an easy prey viz as may be supposed repeated by some fourth person kurahashi yama in yamato the song like the next is too clear to stand in need of explanation ladder like is an attempt to render the force of the pillow wordhashi tate see mabuchi dictionary of pillow words for the exact force attributed to it by mabuchi for uda see sect

astonished at so strange an occurrence as that of wild goose laying an egg in yamato and asks the noble take uchi whether he had ever heard of the like of it before take uchi being at that time more

need explanation as in the preceding one yamato is accompanied by the pillow wordsora mitsu or imperial say motowori and moribe who refer this episode to time previous to nin toku accession the wild goose has laid an egg in token of the future accession to the throne the translator prefers the view expressed by keichiū in hiskō gan shō and adopted in the explanationof the songs in the chronicles of japan that the wordstsuki na at last must here be taken in the sense of long and the song interpreted to mean the wild goose lays an egg as an omen that thy reign will be long one this view is supported by the story in the chronicles which places the song in the emperor fiftieth year and gives him thirty six years of subsequent existence thus making the prophecy amply fulfil itself as one would expect that it should do in the pages of such work according to the other view the text of the chronicles calls for emendation hogi uta no kata uta for incomplete song see sect lxxxix note next

the reign of the emperor jin and the song is attributed to that monarch in this song the sound of the twanging of the lute that had been made from the remnant of the boat karanu is compared to the

by people when shall have slept delightfully if there is the disorder of the cuthydropyrum latifolium let there be disorder —when shall have slept good sleep this is rustic lifting song bp see sect xxxii note the wording of this sentence would make it appear that it was onlyafterthe emperor in giyo death that king karu was chosen to succeed him but probably king karu had been appointed heir apparent during his father life time as is indeed expressly stated in the chronicles and is implied in later passages of this work and what our author meant to say was it was settled that king karu should rule the empire after the former sovereign decease etc the meaning of the song is the sister the mistress whom wooed with such difficulty is now easily mine —the first phrase down to mountain height is but preface to the poem properly so called serving to introduce by ajeu de motsthe wordshita dohi which means not only hidden conduit but hidden wooing at the same time the impliedcomparisonof the poet secret love of one so difficult to obtain as his own sister to the course of the water in hidden conduits which is carried up the mountain side to irrigate field perched in spot almost inaccessible is by no means devoid of aptness the word mountain yama is in the original preceded by the pillow wordashihiki oraskiki no whose signification is obscure and much disputed shirage uta written phonetically the interpretation of the term here adopted is that which has the sanction of motowori and moribe they explain it to signify that the voice rose gradually toward the latter part of the song as in the case of the preceding song the first phrase is but preface which plays on the coincidence in sound between the wordstashi dashi rattling andtashika certainly undisturbedly the signification of the song proper is if shall but have gratified my passion what care however men may plot against me if can but press my beloved to my bosom let all things go to rack and ruin like the hydropyrum latifolium grass which when cut falls into disorder —of the sentiment of the song the less said the better but viewed simply from literary point of view it is certainly one of the most fascinating little productions of the early japanese muse and the literal rendering of it into english does it woful injustice moribe rightly rejects motowori proposal to divide the poem in two after the wordshito hakayu to mo plotted against by people kari komo no of thehydropyrum latifolium is pillow word hinaburi no ageuta the commentators have nothing more precise to tell us concerning the expression lifting song than that it refers to the lifting of the voice in singing next section cxlii —emperor in giyō part vi —war between prince karu and prince anaho the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com therefore all the officials and likewise the people of the empire turned against the heir apparent karu and towards the august child anaho then

insides so those arrows are called by the name of karu arrows prince anaho likewise made implements of war the arrows made by this prince were just the arrows of the present time they are called anaho arrows thereupon anaho raised an army and beleaguered the house of the noble oho make wo mahe then when he reached the gate heavy ice rain was falling so he sang saying come thus under cover of the metal gate of the noble oho mahe wo mahe we will stand till the rain stops then the noble oho mahe came singing lifting his hands striking his knees dancing and waving his arms the song said the courtiers are tumultuous saying that the small bell of the garter of the courtiers has fallen off country people too beware this song is of courtier style singing thus he came near and said august child of our heavenly sovereign come not with arms against the king thine elder brother if thou shouldst come against him with arms people will surely laugh will secure him and present him to thee the prince anaho disbanded his troops and went away so the noble oho make wo mahe secured prince karu and led him forth and presented him to prince anaho the captive prince sang saying maiden of heaven soaring karu if thou cry violently people will know cry quietly like the doves on mount hasa again he sang maiden of heaven soaring karu come and sleep and then pass on oh maiden of karu see sect cxii note oho mahe wo make sukune no omi according to the old readingoho saki wo saki etc motowori considers this double name to denote two brothers the wordsohoandwo great and small naturally lending themselves to the interpretation of elder and younger moribe on the contrary thinks that there was but one and is supported both by the authority of the chronicles of japan and by the fact that except in the chronicles of old matters of former ages which is believed to be forgery no second brother is anywhere mentioned he explains the use of the double name in the prose text as having crept in through the influence of the text of the following song see note below this seems to the translator the better view on this occasion there is here an evident corruption of the text and motowori aptly conjectures that arrow heads or as they are called in japanese arrow points are intended he adds that up till then arrow heads had always been made of iron the author style is here rather at fault for he apparently wishes to say that the arrows employed by prince anaho were those which had been used in ancient times and were still the most universally employed—that in fact they were the usual style of arrow in contradistinction to those of prince karu invention see sect lxxxviii note the prince in this song bids his troops follow his example and take refuge from the rain under cover of the gate of oho mahe house such at least is the actual sense of the words used but motowori sees in them nothing less than slightly veiled exhortation to his followers to attack the castle while moribe on the other hand thinks they were meant to convey to oho mahe hint of his presence and enable the beleaguered prince for whom as being his elder brother prince anaho retained great affection and respect to devise some method of escape this seems extremely far fetched —the word metal probably refers only to the fastenings of the gate and not to its whole structure the exact purport and application of this song is disputed but this much seems clear that the composer of it seeks to quiet both the besieging army out of politeness called courtiers and the peasants who had joined the fray by making light of the whole occurrence which he compares to so trivial an accident as the falling of bell from man garter or leggings the custom of ornamenting this article of dress with smell bell is however not mentioned elsewhere the wordyume which concludes the song and is here rendered beware is identified by motowori and moribe with the imperative of the verbiwu to avoid to shun not to do miya hito buri this is one of the cases which lend support to motowori view that the names of the so called styles of songs are derived from their initial words written with the humble character servant the word used in the text here and also in the next sentence is that which properly denotes the presenting of tribute another reading gives this sense as if the maiden of heaven soaring karu cried violently people would know she cries quietly like the doves on mount hasa paragraph continues according to this reading the poet simply explains the reason of the undemonstrativeness of his mistress grief according to that in the text he implores her not to weep too passionately —amadamuoramadamu ya heaven soaring is the pillow word for karu applied to it punningly on account of its similarity in sound to the wordkari wild goose which well deserves the epithet heaven soaring of mount hasa nothing is known rendered thus according to moribe exegesis which quite approves itself to the translator mind this song signifies oh maiden of karu come and sleep with me but once before my impending banishment renders it hard for us to meet again motowori chooses to interpretneteas crasis ofnayete bending and sees in the song an invitation to the maiden to come quietly so as not to attract observation —the final word translated maiden iswotome domo properly plural but here used in singular sense aswatakuski domo properly we so constantly is in the modern colloquial dialect for the pillow word heaven soaring see preceding note next section cxliii —emperor in giyō part vii —death of

great lord to an island he will indeed make the remaining return voyage beware of my mat mat indeed in words —beware of my spouse this song is of partly lowered rustic style queen so tohoshi presented song to him that song said let not thy feet tread on the oyster shells of the shore of ahine with its summer herbs pass there after having made clear so when afterwards again being unable to restrain her love she went after him she sang saying thy going has become long past will go oh to meet thee wait can not wait what is here calledyama tadzuis what is now known by the name of tatsuge so when in her pursuit she reached the place where prince karu was he who had been pensively waiting sang saying alas beloved spouse who settledst the whereabouts of our grave setting up flags in the great vale setting up flags in the little vale of hatsuse the hidden castle alas beloved spouse whom see after our many troubles prostrate like atsukibow standing like anadzusabow again he sang saying driving sacred piles in the upper reach driving true piles in the lower reach of the river of secluded hatsuse and hanging on the sacrificial piles mirror bunging on the true piles true jewels —if they said that the younger sister whom love like true jewel that the spouse whom love like mirror were there would go home would long for my country having thus sung they forthwith killed themselves together so these two songs are reading songs for iyo see sect note its hot springs are often mentioned in early documents motowori identifies them with place now called dō go the meaning of this song is go where perchance no messengers will reach me but thou must ask tidings of me from the birds ama da buri the title seems to be derived from the initial pillow word of these three songs the meaning of this song seems to the translator to be even if they dare to banish me now shall some day return again respect my mat during my absence mat indeed it is my wife that must be respected the commentators consider the concluding words to be command addressed to the wife and interpret the phrase to mean my spouse beware but surely this makes less good sense and moreover fails to suit the exactly parallel passage in the first song of sect cxxv by the words great lord the princely poet denotes himself —perhaps with touch of anger at the indignity to which he is subjected the difficult expressionfuna amariis here in accordance with moribe view rendered by the words remaining voyage the voyage homeward which is that part of voyage that may be said to remain over for an outward bound vessel when she has reached her destination motowori commentary vol xxxix pp should be consulted for older views of the meaning of the term the expression beware of my mat reminds us that in early days the entire floor of japanese room was not matted according to the modern custom but that each individual had his own mat on which to sit and sleep great care was always taken not to defile another mat conf an elegy from the collection of myriad leaves translated by thepresentwriter in his classical poetry of the japanese hina buri no kata oroshi like most of the names of styles of songs this one is extremely obscure the commentators suppose that one part was sung in lower voice than the rest but they are merely guessing the actual words of the song signify lacerate not thy feet by walking on the unseen oyster shells of the shore of ahine that is covered with the summer herbs but walk there after dawn this is keichiū interpretation of the wordakashite having made clear and is the best in the present writer opinion the latter commentators see in it recommendation to the exiled prince to clear the grass away on either side the wordahinecalls however for special explanation in order that the full import of the poem may be brought out it properly signifies sleeping together or lying on each other and is therefore applicable either to the two spouses or to the summer grass indeed it is doubtful if it be the name of any real place at all the wordnatsu kusamay also be taken simply as pillow word forahine —the total gist of the song is in any case warning from the maiden to her lover to guard himself against the perils of the journey the meaning of this song is it is too long since thy departure can wait no longer but will go and meet thee —the verb to meet mukahe is in the original preceded by the pillow wordyama tadzu which forms the subject of the note appended to the poem by the compiler the commentators are not agreed as to the precise nature of the instrument intended but it seems to have been some kind of axe the cause of its use as pillow word for meeting is equally disputed it only occurs written phonetically the termtatsu ge by which it is explained in the text is there written which does not help us much towards understanding what is meant to be designated so obscure is this song in the original that motowori confesses himself unable to make any sense of it the translator has adopted mortise interpretation according to which the gist of it is this alas my dear wife who wast so willing to be for ever united to me that thou didst even fix on the spot in the funereal vale of hatsuse where we should one day be buried together alas for thee whom at last now see again —in order to arrive at this meaning moribe is obliged to prove more less satisfactorily that the thrice repeated wordwosignifies vale or mountain fold the first two times that it occurs and grave the third and thatkomoriku no hatsuse usually interpreted as secluded hatsuse means the hidden castle the final place the tomb it is also necessary to suppose without authority that the flags mentioned by the poet are meant for funeral flags and that the words prostrate like atsukibow etc which according to the laws of japanese construction precede instead of following the phrase alas beloved spouse etc are but preface for the latter —it will be seen that the foundation on which moribe interpretation rests is slight and that motowori was scarcely to be blamed for pronouncing the song incomprehensible at the same time the translator has thought it better by following moribe to givesometranslation of it than to leave the passage blank with this warning the student may search for other possible meanings if he pleases —hatsuse is still existent and celebrated place among the mountains of yamato the etymology of the name unless we accept moribe mentioned above is obscure it is now usually pronouncedhase thetsukiis said to be almost indistinguishable from thekeyakitree zelkowa keaki theadzusaseems to be thecatalpa kaempferi but some believe it to be the cherry tree the first half of this song down to the words hanging on the true piles true jewels is preface for what follows the significationp of the rest is if my dearly loved sister wife were still at hatsuse in yamato would fly to her either in thought or deed but now that she has followed me into exile the land of exile is good enough —moribe while allowing the first half of the song to be preface for the rest contends that it also should be credited with signification bearing on the subject matter of the main part of the song he supposes namely the religious ceremony whatever it was of driving piles into the bed or bank of the river and of decorating them with beads and mirror to have been one really performed by princess so tohoshi to compass her lover return in the translator opinion it is more elegant and more in accordance with archaic usage to consider the preface as having no special significance or connection otherwise than verbal with the rest of the poem the wordi kuhiori guhi rendered sacred piles occasions some difficulty for it is not certain whether motowori is right in giving to the initial syllableithe meaning of sacred it may be simply what has been termed an ornamental prefix devoid of meaning motowori however points out that this usage of it is restricted to verbs and does not occur with substantives komoriku no the pillow word for hatsuse is rendered by secluded in accordance with mabuchi usually accepted derivation

commands have already passed many years and as my face and form are lean and withered there is no longer any hope nevertheless if do not show the heavenly sovereign how truly have waited my disappointment will be unbearable —and so saying she caused merchandise to be carried on tables holding an hundred and came forth and presented these gifts as tribute thereat the heavenly sovereign who had quite forgotten what he had formerly commanded asked akawi ko saying what old woman art thou and why art thou come hither then akawiko replied saying having in such and such month of such and such year received the heavenly sovereign commands have been reverently awaiting the great command until this day and eighty years have past by now my appearance is quite decrepit and there is no

age and could not make the marriage but he conferred on her an august song that song said how awful is the sacred oak tree the oak tree of the august dwelling maiden of the oak plain again he sang saying the younger chestnut orchard plain of hiketa —o si dormivissem cum iliâ in juventâ oh how old she has become then the tears that akawi ko wept quite drenched the red dyed sleeve that she had on in reply to the great august song she sang saying left over from the piling up of the jewel wall piled up round the august dwelling —to whom shall the person of the deity temple go again she sang

appearance of the sacred tree in the temple grounds and is moved by this religious thought to repent of his neglectful treatment as her who had so patiently waited for him through so many years motowori on the contrary sees in the words nothing more than comparison of the old woman to some sacred tree of immemorial age and the aversion felt by the monarch to an union with her —the oak mentioned the kashi quercus myrsinæfolia is an evergreen species both motowori and moribe consider thatmimoroin the original japanese of this song should be taken not as proper name see sect xxviii notes and but simply as signifying sacred dwelling as miwa is mentioned in the earlier part of the story it might seem more natural to regardmimoroas likewise being proper name but the word mimoro itself signifying sacred spot the difference between the two views does not amount to much and it is best to follow native authority oak plain kashi hara means place planted with oak trees the first sentence of the song must be looked on as sort of preface to the second the first words of this song down to the colon and dash are preface to the song proper whose meaning stands in need of no explanation —moribe surmises that the wordkuri chestnut was formerlyp general name for all sorts of fruits somewhat like ourenglishword berry the drenching of the sleeve with tears is common figure in japanese poetry or we might following moribe render thus left over from the guarding of the jewel grove guard at the august dwelling etc the wording of his song is far from clear while motowori sees in it reference to the construction of wall round the ground of temple the overplus of the materials for which sacred wall could not it may be presumed be applied to any profane purpose moribe disputes the propriety of such an interpretation of the wordkakiwhich according to him denotes the grove planted in temple grounds temples never having been surrounded by walls such as motowori assumes the existence of nor even by hedges or fences which is the more usual acceptation of the term he thinks therefore that the superficial signification of the actual words of the song is that the priest who has all his life been in the service of one particular shrine cannot desert it for the adoration of some other deity the underlying deeper significance of the little poem is in either case the same akawi ko had during her long waiting of eighty years remained true to her first love the emperor for every reason it had been impossible for her ever to give her affections to another and she had now come up to the capital to demonstrate to him who had forgotten her the unchangeable nature of her feelings this pretty little poem is too clear to need any comment moribe supposes that some lotuses brought from kusaka may have been among the presents made by akawi ko to the emperor in the original japanese the reference to the lotuses comes first as sort of preface to the rest of the

nu akidzu nu see note to this section bor bit the signification of the greater portion of this song is clear enough and is sufficiently explained by the context the word who however admits of two interpretations motowori taking it to signify some one whereas moribe keeping the literal meaning of who sees in it an angry exclamation of the monarch at having been brought out to the hunt under exaggerated promises of game womuro means little cave but is here proper name mi yeshinuis form of the word yoshino which is frequently met with in poetry the syllable mi being probably as mabuchi tells us in his commentary on the collection of myriad leaves equivalent toma and therefore simply an ornamental prefix the phrase tranquilly carries on the government represents the japaneseyasumishishi the pillow word forwa go oho kimi our great lord which latter phrase descriptive of the sovereign is here put into the sovereign own mouth of white stuff shiro tahe no is another pillow word the only real difficulty in this song meets us is the interpretation of its concluding sentence the meaning apparently intended to be conveyed is that it was in order to prove itself worthy of its name that the dragon fly performed the loyal deed which forms the subject of the tale but it so the author forgets that it was not the dragon fly that was called after japan but japan that was called after the dragon fly akidzushima dragon fly island fromakidzu dragon fly what should be the point of the whole poem therefore fails of application the name island of the dragon fly has

the hundred branchingtsuki tree there fell leaf and floated in the great august cup the female attendant not knowing that the fallen leaf was floating in the cup did not desist from presenting the great august liquor to the heavenly sovereign who perceiving the leaf floating in the cup knocked the female attendant down put his sword to her neck and was about to cut off her head when the female attendant spoke to the heavenly sovereign saying slay me not there is something that must say to thee and forthwith she sang saying the palace of hishiro at makimuku is palace where shines the morning sun palace where glistens the evening sun palace plentifully rooted as the root of the bamboo palace with spreading roots like the roots of the trees palace pestled with oh eight hundred loads of earth as for the branches of the hundred fold flourishingtsuki tree growing by the house of new licking at the august gate made of chamæcyparis wood the uppermost branch has the sky above it the middle branch has the east above it the lowest branch has the country above it leaf from the tip of the uppermost branch falls against the middle branch leaf from the tip of the middle branch falls against the lowest branch leaf from the tip of the lowest branch falling into the oil floating in the fresh jewelled goblet which the maidp of mihe is lifting up all goes curdle curdle ah this is very awful august child of the high shining sun the tradition of the thing too this so on her presenting this song her crime was pardoned then the empress sang her song said present the luxuriant august

growing by the house of new licking in this high metropolis of yamato on this high timbered mound of the metropolis the tradition of this thing too this forthwith the heavenly sovereign sang saying the people of the great palace having put on scarfs like the quail birds having put their tails together like wagtails and congregated together like the yard sparrows may perhaps to day be truly steeped in liquor —the people of the palace of the high shining sun the tradition of the thing too this these three songs are songs of heavenly words so at this copious feast this female attendant from mihe was praised and plentifully endowed bp said to be scarcely distinguishable from thekeyaki zelkowa keaki bsee sect lxxxix note literally still presented to understand the allusion at the beginning of this song to the palace of hishiro at makimuku which had been the residence of the emperor kei kō see sect lxxvi note it must be known that in the account of the reign of that monarch as given in the chronicles there is story which like that in the text turns on carelessness in dealing with goblet —carelessness which kei kō graciously pardoned moreover the scene of the incident here related was in the immediate neighbourhood of the old palace of hishiro there was therefore double reason for referring to that place and the under current of insinuation is that as kei kō in the olden time forgave the courtiers who forgot his goblet will not the present sovereign forgive the maid of mihe for letting leaf fall into his the poetess after describing the splendour and solidity of the imperial abode passes on to mention of the luxuriant and many branchingtsuki tree growing near the house of new licking the sacred hall where the sovereign performed each year the ceremony of tasting the first fruits of the harvest the gate may either be taken in its literal acceptation or else regarded as used by metonymy for the palace itself the description of that which the middle and lowest branches have above them is somewhat obscure and perhaps the words should not be too strictly pressed for perfectly rational meaning their chief use being as metrical parallelisms the supposition of the commentators is however that the poetess in speaking of this immense tree meant to say that the middle branch or branches spread eastward and the lowest branches westward next we are told of the fall of the fatal leaf into the oil into the liquor contained in the imperial goblet and the poetess before acknowledging the awfulness of her misdemeanour skilfully brings in an allusion to the japanese account of the creation when the drops that fell from the spear used by the creator and creatrix izanagi and izanami to make the brine go curdle curdle did very good work indeed for they were piled up and became the first formed island for the japanese archipelago see sect iii for drops to fall down or for leaves to fall into drops of wine must therefore surely be good omen rather than crime conformably with the hesitating nature of her allusion the maiden leaves it quite uncertain what is conceived of as going curdle curdle in the present instance in fact neither must the thought be pressed too far nor the sentence searched too rigorously from grammatical point of view such intentional vagueness is one of the specific characteristics of great deal of the poetry of japan the words the tradition of the thing too this which conclude the poem are obscure in another and more usual sense but having been already treated of in note to sect xxiv they need not detain us here they do not affect the sense of the rest of the poem two points more remain to be noticed one is that the wordmiheandhi no mi hado august gate ofchamæcyparis are respectively preceded by the pillow wordsariginu no whose signification is disputed andmakisaku which signifies splitting true trees the other that the original of the word glistens near the commencement of the poem only has that sense if followingmoribe we identifyhi gakeruwithhi kagayakeru as it stands the wordkakerulends itself more naturally to the interpretation of sets but the logical difficulty of accepting the phrase where the sun sets in such context where on the contrary some phrase of good omen is alone appropriate seems greater than the philological difficulty of derivinghi gakeruby process of contraction fromhi kagayakeru the designation of the emperor or heir apparent by the title of august child of the high shining sun has been met with before and needs no explanation when the solar ancestry claimed by the japanese monarchs is called to mind the gist of this song which must be supposed to be addressed to the female attendant is simply present the goblet full of liquor to the emperor —in accordance with the rules of japanese construction the imperative present which is the chief verb of the sentence comes last and is preceded by the comparison of the monarch to the leaves and flowers of the camellia tree while the comparatively unimportant words describing the position of the tree come at the beginning thus in literal english translation the climax is necessarily spoilt through the reversal of the order of the words the broad leafed camellia has already appeared in sect cxxiii note the house of new licking has been explained in the note immediately preceding the present one and the incomprehensible concluding exclamation has been discussed in sect xxiv note the high metropolis of yamato is of course the then capital there is however some doubt whether the word take chi which is here thus rendered should not rather be considered as proper name the expressionko dakaru rendered high timbered is also doubtful motowori interprets it simply as slightly high moribe seems right in explaining the wordtsukasato mean mound this song is here out of place and is supposed by motowori to have been composed not by the emperor but by some court lady who was absent from the feast the meaning simply is ah yes ’tis to day that the court ladies are drinking their fill of rice liquor —andp would that were with them —the picture here presented of the manners of the court is not attractive but the comparison of the ladies appearance with that of various birds is quaint the commentators tell us thattheappropriateness of the use of the word scarfs as applied to the quail lies in the peculiar plumage of that bird which makes it look as if it had scarf on having put their tails together means standing with their trains in row the epithet yard applied to the sparrows paints the habits of that bird the words great palace are in the original preceded by the pillow wordmomoshiki no whose signification is disputed after lines kefu mo ka mosaka mi dzuku rashi rendered may perhaps to day be truly steeped in liquor moribe would like to consider the lines asu ma komasaka mi dzuku rashi may perhaps to morrow be truly steeped in liquor to have been accidentally omitted there is no doubt but that their insertion would add to the effect of the poem from the point of view of style readama koto uta this expression is altogether obscure and the commentators differ in their interpretations of it mabuchi following the characters sees in them an allusion to the words august child of the high shining sun which recurs in each of the three songs thus bracketed together motowori thinks thatama kotoshould be regarded as standing foramari goto surplus words in allusion to the meaninglessrefrainwith which the songs in question terminate other songs however which end in the same manner are not thus designated moribe exegesis though founded on motowori is preferable to it acceptingama kotoas contraction ofamari goto he would take the second half of the compound in the sense of things not words not and regard the whole as signifying that the songs were composed or sung after the conclusion of the actual feast against this view must be set the fact that the chinese characters lend it no support the translator has as usual when in doubt preferred to adhere to the sense given by the characters next section clxi —emperor yū riyaku part xii —songs

maiden to hold firmly the flagon containing the intoxicating liquor and motowori is as moribe remarks putting more into the words than they are really meant to convey when he says that they implypraiseon the monarch part —the english words grandee daughter represent the japaneseomi no omina somewhat remarkable expression which is interpreted by motowori to signify attendant maiden the translator prefers the view propounded in moribe comment on this song and has therefore adopted it the expression is in the original preceded by the untranslatable pillow wordminasossoku moribe reads the last syllable with thenigori —gu the word rendered excellent flagon isho dari the first element of the compound being explained by the commentators in the sense of excellent big while the second is the same as the modern wordtaru cask in ancient times however the signification oftariortaruwas that of vessel to pour liquor from notp to store liquor in —i flagon not cask the words quite firmly more and more firmly represent the japaneseshita gataku ya gatakuaccording to moribe exegesis motowori interpretation of them in the sense of take the bottom firmly and the top firmly is less acceptable thus does the editor of who is followed by moribe understand the original expressionuki uta motowori interpretation floating song seems less good so enamoured is the maiden of the sovereign that shewouldfain be even the board of the arm rest on which he leans —the expression lower board is misleading for it refers simply to the self evident fact that the board forming the top of the little low table used as an arm rest by one squatting on his mat is below the arm as whose support it serves the words stands leaning must probably be understood to signify sits or squats leaning the expression our great lord who tranquilly carries on the government is frequently recurring periphrasis for the word emperor and has been explained in sect lxxxvii note the words at morn and at eve are literally in the original at morning doors and at evening doors the reference being to the fact that the doors of house are respectively opened and closed in the early morning and at nightfall the

were at their height they all danced in turn so two young children employed to light the fire sat beside the furnace these young children were made to dance then one of the young children said do thou the elder brother dance first the elder brother likewise said do thou the younger brother dance first when they thus yielded to each other the people who were met together laughed at their manner of yielding to each other so at last the elder brother danced and when he had finished the younger when about to dance chanted saying on the bamboos on the mountain slopes behind which are hidden as soon as they appear my warrior mate sword on whose hilt red earth was daubed for whose cord red cloth was cut and his red flags that were set up —beggarly descendants of king ichinobe no oshiha august child of the heavenly sovereign izaho wake who ruled the empire as it were cutting the bamboos roots and bending down their extremities and like playing on an eight stringed lute then forthwith chief wodate starting at the sound of these words and rolling off his couch drove away the people of the cave and having set the two princes one on his left knee and the other onhisright and wept and

the feast the word can scarcely here have its common signification of kitchen range at the fact of their being so courteous to each other this so called chant —it is not song because not in metre and is accordingly not transcribed syllabically —is at first sight so difficult as to seem to defy translation and to make the student apply to the whole of his interpretation motowori closing remark on his exegesis of one of phrases contained in it this is mere guess work and the text demands further consideration little inspection shows however that the drift of the words is by no means so inscrutable as its partly ideographic and partly phonetic transcription makes it appear the first part down to the colon and dash is preface to the second the pivot joining the two parts in the original japanese being the word bamboos the laws of english construction unfortunately do not admit of the force of theoriginal which entirely depends on the position of the words being rendered into our language the appropriateness of the preface to the body of the chant rests on the consideration that the bright articles mentioned in it viz the sword painted and decorated with red streamers or perhaps tied on with red sash and also the red banners are easilyhiddenbehind the thick leaves of bamboo grove just as the imperial origin of the two young princes was hidden beneath the vile office which they filled in shizhimu household the clause cutting the bamboos roots and bending down their extremities forms the chief difficulty indeed the word roots is supplied by motowori and his interpretation of the phrase is merely tentative we may however until some better explanation is offered see in it reference to the energetic manner in which the empire was ruled by the young princes grandfather the emperor izaho wake chiū or else perhaps by their father ichinobe no oshiha this latter view is preferred by motowori though according to the history ichinobe no oshiha never actually ascended the throne the position of the verb ruled in the japanese text permits of either interpretation the comparison of the government of the empire to playing on lute is poetical and appropriate itshouldbe noticed that in the japanese text the construction of the sentence forming the main body of the chant is the reverse of what it is made to appear to be in the translation the words beggarly descendants by which as climax the singer reveals his own and his brother illustrious descent therefore come last of all and produce on wodate the startling effect which we read of in the next sentence or seat in ancient times each person in room sat on special mat and it is that small mat which is here meant the numeral is accompanied by the auxiliaryhashira properly used for gods and

later at the commencement of the reign of the emperor mu retsu and not only do many of the details disagree but the arrangement and number of the songs is different it is impossible to make consistent whole out of the story as here given so while noticing the linguistic peculiarities of each of the songs in the order in which they appear in the present text the translator has thought it advisable following moribe to give in note consistent scheme of interpretation for the whole the small roman numbers placed in brackets at the commencement of each song indicate its place in the text as restored by moribe by one or other of the two princes ohoke and woke each we are afterwards told ceded the empire to the other and it therefore remained for some time uncertain which was to be the

ascertain heguri no omi conf sect lxi note uda no obito ra udais the name of place in yamato big fish but see the remark on this name in note uta gaki the derivation of this curious expression is

charactersoris supposed to signify pent roof or the eaves of the roof or else an out house connected by slanting roof with the main building the great palace is the palace of prince woke the great

shall be broken the great fish ofuwo yo shi is the pillow word forshibi tunny the word he which might also be rendered it —the original being so must be taken to refer both to the fish itself and to the grandee shibi the grandee tunny who bore its name —following moribe acceptable restoration of the original story which is founded on comparison of the text of these records with that of the chronicles of japan we find that in the first song of the series the young prince half jokingly remarks on the fact of the grandee shibi appearing in public with the damsel who was to have been his the prince bride shibi name which as already stated signifies tunny furnishes the occasion for the marine metaphors borrowed from the current and the breakers shibi answer song ii —in the records wrongly ascribed to the prince takes up the same strain but in moredauntingtone the prince is likened to fisherman who would fain make futile attempt to spear the great tunny and his the tunny the grandee shibi presence must indeed be pain and grief to him in third song which is given in the chronicles but not in the records the prince retorts that he relies on his good sword to win the girl for him in the end and in song iv the grandee jeers at the dilapidated condition of his palace and by implication at the sorry state of his fortunes —a taunt to which the prince replies in song by saying that if the palace is dilapidated and the empire in disorder the fault belongs to none other than to the grandeehimself songs vi and vii which are not found in the records only serve to continue the growing war of words which in song vii in the records wrongly attributed to the grandee comes to climax by the prince exclaiming that if he does not force his way into the grandee mansion to seize his lady love it is only on account of the magnanimity of his disposition to this the grandee replies in song ix in the records erroneously attributed to the prince by sort oftu quoque vowing that he will cut and burn his way into the prince palace this is not the end of the dispute in the pages of the chronicles but it is all that need detain the reader of the records it should however be mentioned that in the chronicles the name of the girl iskage hime ofuwo big fish which is here given would seem to be nothing morep than nickname which perhaps arose from the incidents of this metrics

wide kindness so he built house for the old woman to dwell in dose to the palace and always sent for her every day so he hung bell by the door of the great hall and always rang it when he wished to

version of the story he tells us that as support to the infirm old lady the emperor had string or rope stretched as sort of hand rest along the way she was obliged to pass in order to reach the imperial apartments and that at the end of the rope was bell whose tinkling notified the emperor of her approach the conjectural exclamation whichclosesthe little poem has therefore an obvious sense which would be wanting if the bell were at the other end as in the version here given for the emperor would not give expression to surprise at her approach if he had himself just rung for her to come far distant is an imperfect attempt to represent the pillow wordmomo dzutafu which here alludes to the stagesp along which the old woman may be supposed to be travelling the valley and the moor overgrown with short grass form an allusion to the way —long and arduous for her —which oki me had to traverse to reach the imperial apartments and they contain possibly further allusion to

disfigured the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com the heavenly sovereign deeply hating the heavenly sovereign oho hatsuse who had slain the king his father wished to be revenged on his spirit so when wishing to destroy the august mausoleum of the heavenly sovereign oho hatsuse he was about to send people to execute this design his elder brother his augustness ohoke addressed him saying to demolish this august mausoleum thou shouldst not send other people none but myself shall go and will demolish it according to the heavenly sovereign august heart then the heavenly sovereign commanded make thy progress then according to thy decree wherefore his augustness ohoke having proceeded down himself slightly excavated the side of the august mausoleum and returned up to the capital and reported that he had dug up and demolished it then the heavenly sovereign astonished at the quickness of his return up asked how he had demolished it he replied saying slightly excavated the earth at the side of the august mausoleum the heavenly sovereign said wishing to be revenged on the enemy of the king our father had counted on the complete demolition of the mausoleum why hast thou only slightly excavated it he replied saying the reason why did so was that the wish to be revenged on the spirit of the foe of the king our father is truly just nevertheless the heavenly sovereign oho hatsuse though he were our father foe was still our uncle and moreover was an heavenly sovereign who ruled the empire so if we now simply from the consideration of his having been our father enemy were completely to demolish the mausoleum of an heavenly sovereign who ruled the empire after generations would surely revile us meanwhile the wrongs of the king our father must not be unrevenged so slightly excavated the side of the mausoleum this insult will quite suffice as token to future ages on his thus addressing him the heavenly sovereign said this also is

few various readings of the text of these poems where any occur the translator has been guided by the decisions of motowori and moribe occasionally these two authorities differ as to the division of the words into lines and moribe in particular does not hesitate to propose such emendations as seem to him necessary the translator has in almost all cases adhered to the traditional text but gives in foot notes such emendations as appear worthy of notice moribe division of the lines being in almost every case preferable to motowori it has however here been generally adopted motowori readsmagishi atane tsukias two lines motowori readssagiri ni tatamu zoas two lines motowori readsmitani futa watarasuas two lines motowori readsuda no taka ki nias two lines moribe emendsharutohari motowori divides these lines thus tachi soba no mi no nakeku we motowori readsgomoreruas line by itself and similarlyuruhashias line by itself moribe restores the reading of the first line of this poem tonaduzki ta no and both he and motowori suggest conjectural concluding lines to supplement the evidently incomplete text moribe are very elegant shi ga tsura no hahi motohori motohorite ne naki tohedomo koto mo norasanu moribe readsumi ga ha isahofuas one line it is difficult on any method of division to find rhythm in this song motowori strangely makesmi ki noaya niinto two lines the syllablekiin the last line of the song is supplied by moribe motowori divides these lines thus han ami ha shihishi nasu he also proposes here to divide the poem in two motowori divides these lines thus mayo gaki ko ni kaki tare the defective text of this line is restored by the help of the parallel passage in the chronicles moribe proposes to emend the second half of this poem to koto nagushi we kokoro gushi we ware wehi ni keri near the commencement of this song motowori divides the lines thus watari ze ni tateru adzusa yumi mo yumi and again at the end kirazu zo kuru adzusa yumi ma yumi see sect cxxii note for this doubtful word motowori divides this line in two thus habiro yutsuma tsubaki instead of these concluding long lines motowori divides thus wa ga mikahoshi kumi ha kadzuraki taka miya wagihe no atari motowori reads the wordshara ni aruas separate line moribe following the reading in the chronicles omits the postpositionnoafterkaru and motowori readshato noas line by itself to the wordashimoribe would prefix the honorificmiwhich he finds in an old ms the metre would gain by this emendation of the line this is moribe emendation of usual readingka motowori dividesari to ihaba koso niinto two lines after the particleto and moribe omits the particleniafterkoso it seems less good to divide thus with motowori tare zo oho mahe ni mawosu or thus with mabuchi tare zo oho maye ni mawosu motowori divides the lines of this song thus yasumishishi wa ga oho kimi no asobashishi shishi no yami shishi no utaki kashikomi wa ga nike noborishi ari wo no hari no hi no yeda motowori divides this line in two thus mina koworo koworo ni motowori divides this line in two after the wordha biro moribe proposal to emendyakemutoyaremuwould be acceptable if it were supported by the authority of any texts motowori edition and most other texts haveshibias the final word but moribe emendation toamais necessary to the sense and has at least the authority of one ms to support it next appendix ii chronology of sovereigns mentioned in the kojiki and nihongi the kojiki translated by basil hall chamberlain at sacred texts com the hitherto accepted chronology of the early japanese sovereigns mentioned in the records of ancient matters ko ji ki and in the chronicles of japan ni hongi this accepted chronology is contained in the first three columns of figures whereof the first two giving the corresponding dates according to the european reckoning are transcribed from some comparative chronological tables by mr ernest satow printed for private distribution in the ages of the monarchs in the third column are from the digest of the imperial pedigree work published by the imperial japanese government is and therefore carrying with it the weight of authority it might perhaps be too much to say that even its decisions are universally bowed to by the nativeliterati but the differences between various writers are all slight and excepting on points that affect only very few years the chronology contained in the first three columns may justly be styled the accepted chronology both as far as natives and as far as foreigners are concerned it will be seen that it is founded in the main on the statements contained in the chronicles of japan though sometimes differing therefrom as well as from the records the fourth column contains the ages of the monarchs according to the records and the fifth their ages according to the chronicles the portion printed in italics and including little over thousand years is that which has been shown in section of the
