language which everyone can understand and which no one can misunderstand like quran sura peace in mind sometimes written peaceinmind in mind is prohept peace in mind is muslim sura al fatiha the opening in the name of allah the beneficent the merciful praise be to allah lord of the worlds the beneficent the merciful master of the day of judgment thee alone we worship thee alone we ask for help show us the straight path the path of those whom thou hast favoured not the path of those who earn thine anger nor of those who go astray sura al baqara the cow alif lam mim this is the scripture whereof there is no doubt guidance unto those who ward off evil who believe in the unseen and establish worship and spend of that we have bestowed upon them and who believe in that which is revealed unto thee muhammad and that which was revealed before thee and are certain of the hereafter these depend on guidance from their lord these are the successful as for the disbelievers whether thou warn them or thou warn them not it is all one for them they believe not allah hath sealed their hearing and their hearts and on their eyes there is covering theirs will be an awful doom and of mankind are some who say we believe in allah and the last day when they believe not they think to beguile allah and those who believe and they beguile none save themselves but they perceive not in their hearts is disease and allah increaseth their disease painful doom is theirs because they lie and when it is said unto them make not mischief in the earth they say we are peacemakers only are not they indeed the mischief makers but they perceive not and when it is said unto them believe as the people believe they say shall we believe as the foolish believe are not they indeed the foolish but they know not and when they fall in with those who believe they say we believe but when they go apart to their devils they declare lo we are with you verily we did but mock allah himself doth mock them leaving them to wander blindly on in their contumacy to do list find references with punishment for apostasy and abolish them explicitly allow apostasy things and more these are they who purchase error at the price of guidance so their commerce doth not prosper neither are they guided their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindleth fire and when it sheddeth its light around him allah taketh away their light and leaveth them in darkness where they cannot see deaf dumb and blind and they return not or like rainstorm from the sky wherein is darkness thunder and the flash of lightning they thrust their fingers in their ears by reason of the thunderclaps for fear of death allah encompasseth the disbelievers in his guidance his omniscience and his omnipotence the lightning almost snatcheth away their sight from them as often as it flasheth forth for them they walk therein and when it darkeneth against them they stand still if allah willed he could destroy their hearing and their sight lo allah is able to do all things mankind worship your lord who hath created you and those before you so that ye may ward off evil who hath appointed the earth resting place for you and the sky canopy and causeth water to pour down from the sky thereby producing fruits as food for you and do not set up rivals to allah when ye know better and if ye are in doubt concerning that which we reveal unto our slave muhammad then produce surah of the like thereof and call your witness beside allah if ye are truthful and if ye do it not and ye can never do it then guard yourselves against the fire prepared for disbelievers whose fuel is of men and stones and give glad tidings muhammad unto those who believe and do good works that theirs are gardens underneath which rivers flow as often as they are regaled with food of the fruit thereof they say this is what was given us aforetime and it is given to them in resemblance there for them are pure companions there for ever they abide lo allah disdaineth not to coin the similitude even of gnat those who believe know that it is the truth from their lord but those who disbelieve say what doth allah wish to teach by such similitude he misleadeth many thereby and he guideth many thereby and he misleadeth thereby only miscreants those who break the covenant of allah after ratifying it and sever that which allah ordered to be joined and who make mischief in the earth those are they who are the losers how disbelieve ye in allah when ye were dead and he gave life to you then he will give you death then life again and then unto him ye will return he it is who created for you all that is in the earth then turned he to the heaven and fashioned it as seven heavens and he is knower of all things and when thy lord said unto the angels lo am about to place viceroy in the earth they said wilt thou place therein one who will do harm therein and will shed blood while we we hymn thy praise and sanctify thee he said surely know that which ye know not and he taught adam all the names then showed them to the angels saying inform me of the names of these if ye are truthful they said be glorified we have no knowledge saving that which thou hast taught us lo thou only thou art the knower the wise he said adam inform them of their names and when he had informed them of their names he said did not tell you that know the secret of the heavens and the earth and know that which ye disclose and which ye hide and when we said unto the angels prostrate yourselves before adam they fell prostrate all save iblis he demurred through pride and so became disbeliever and we said adam dwell thou and thy wife in the garden and eat ye freely of the fruits thereof where ye will but come not nigh this tree lest ye become wrong doers but satan caused them to deflect therefrom and expelled them from the happy state in which they were and we said fall down one of you foe unto the other there shall be for you on earth habitation and provision for time then adam received from his lord words of revelation and he relented toward him lo he is the relenting the merciful we said go down all of you from hence but verily there cometh unto you from me guidance and whoso followeth my guidance there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve but they who disbelieve and deny our revelations such are rightful peoples of the fire they will abide therein children of israel remember my favour wherewith favoured you and fulfil your part of the covenant shall fulfil my part of the covenant and fear me and believe in that which reveal confirming that which ye possess already of the scripture and be not first to disbelieve therein and part not with my revelations for trifling price and keep your duty unto me confound not truth with falsehood nor knowingly conceal the truth establish worship pay the poor due and bow your heads with those who bow in worship enjoin ye righteousness upon mankind while ye yourselves forget to practise it and ye are readers of the scripture have ye then no sense seek help in patience and prayer and truly it is hard save for the humbleminded who know that they will have to meet their lord and that unto him they are returning children of israel remember my favour wherewith favoured you and how preferred you to all creatures and guard yourselves against day when no soul will in aught avail another nor will intercession be accepted from it nor will compensation be received from it nor will they be helped and remember when we did deliver you from pharaoh folk who were afflicting you with dreadful torment slaying your sons and sparing your women that was tremendous trial from your lord and when we brought you through the sea and rescued you and drowned the folk of pharaoh in your sight and when we did appoint for moses forty nights of solitude and then ye chose the calf when he had gone from you and were wrong doers then even after that we pardoned you in order that ye might give thanks and when we gave unto moses the scripture and the criterion of right and wrong that ye might be led aright and when moses said unto his people my people ye have wronged yourselves by your choosing of the calf for worship so turn in penitence to your creator and kill the guilty yourselves that will be best for you with your creator and he will relent toward you lo he is the relenting the merciful and when ye said moses we will not believe in thee till we see allah plainly and even while ye gazed the lightning seized you then we revived you after your extinction that ye might give thanks and we caused the white cloud to overshadow you and sent down on you the manna and the quails saying eat of the good things wherewith we have provided you they wronged us not but they did wrong themselves and when we said go into this township and eat freely of that which is therein and enter the gate prostrate and say repentance we will forgive you your sins and will increase reward for the right doers but those who did wrong changed the word which had been told them for another saying and we sent down upon the evil doers wrath from heaven for their evil doing and when moses asked for water for his people we said smite with thy staff the rock and there gushed out therefrom twelve springs so that each tribe knew their drinking place eat and drink of that which allah hath provided and do not act corruptly making mischief in the earth and when ye said moses we are weary of one kind of food so call upon thy lord for us that he bring forth for us of that which the earth groweth of its herbs and its cucumbers and its corn and its lentils and its onions he said would ye exchange that which is higher for that which is lower go down to settled country thus ye shall get that which ye demand and humiliation and wretchedness were stamped upon them and they were visited with wrath from allah that was because they disbelieved in allah revelations and slew the prophets wrongfully that was for their disobedience and transgression lo those who believe in that which is revealed unto thee muhammad and those who are jews and christians and sabaeans whoever believeth in allah and the last day and doeth right surely their reward is with their lord and there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve and remember children of israel when we made covenant with you and caused the mount to tower above you saying hold fast that which we have given you and remember that which is therein that ye may ward off evil then even after that ye turned away and if it had not been for the grace of allah and his mercy ye had been among the losers and ye know of those of you who broke the sabbath how we said unto them be ye apes despised and hated and we made it an example to their own and to succeeding generations and an admonition to the allah fearing and when moses said unto his people lo allah commandeth you that ye sacrifice cow they said dost thou make game of us he answered allah forbid that should be among the foolish they said pray for us unto thy lord that he make clear to us what cow she is moses answered lo he saith verily she is cow neither with calf nor immature she is between the two conditions so do that which ye are commanded they said pray for us unto thy lord that he make clear to us of what colour she is moses answered lo he saith verily she is yellow cow bright is her colour gladdening beholders they said pray for us unto thy lord that he make clear to us what cow she is lo cows are much alike to us and lo if allah wills we may be led aright moses answered lo he saith verily she is cow unyoked she plougheth not the soil nor watereth the tilth whole and without mark they said now thou bringest the truth so they sacrificed her though almost they did not and remember when ye slew man and disagreed concerning it and allah brought forth that which ye were hiding and we said smite him with some of it thus allah bringeth the dead to life and showeth you his portents so that ye may understand then even after that your hearts were hardened worse than rocks for hardness for indeed there are gush and indeed there are rocks which split asunder them and indeed there are rocks which fall down for not unaware of what ye do and became as rocks or rocks from out which rivers so that water floweth from the fear of allah allah is have ye any hope that they will be true to you when party of them used to listen to the word of allah then used to change it after they had understood it knowingly and when they fall in with those who believe they say we believe but when they go apart one with another they say prate ye to them of that which allah hath disclosed to you that they may contend with you before your lord concerning it have ye then no sense are they then unaware that allah knoweth that which they keep hidden and that which they proclaim among them are unlettered folk who know the scripture not except from hearsay they but guess therefore woe be unto those who write the scripture with their hands and then say this is from allah that they may purchase small gain therewith woe unto them for that their hands have written and woe unto them for that they earn thereby and they say the fire of punishment will not touch us save for certain number of days say have ye received covenant from allah truly allah will not break his covenant or tell ye concerning allah that which ye know not nay but whosoever hath done evil and his sin surroundeth him such are rightful owners of the fire they will abide therein and those who believe and do good works such are rightful owners of the garden they will abide therein and remember when we made saying worship none save allah and to orphans and the needy and and pay the poor due then after averse covenant with the children of israel only and be good to parents and to kindred speak kindly to mankind and establish worship that ye slid back save few of you being and when we made with you covenant saying shed not the blood of your people nor turn party of your people out of your dwellings then ye ratified our covenant and ye were witnesses thereto yet ye it is who slay each other and drive out party of your people from their homes supporting one another against them by sin and transgression and if they came to you as captives ye would ransom them whereas their expulsion was itself unlawful for you believe ye in part of the scripture and disbelieve ye in part thereof and what is the reward of those who do so save ignominy in the life of the world and on the day of resurrection they will be consigned to the most grievous doom for allah is not unaware of what ye do such are those who buy the life of the world at the price of the hereafter their punishment will not be lightened neither will they have support and verily we gave unto moses the scripture and we caused train of messengers to follow after him and we gave unto jesus son of mary clear proofs of allah sovereignty and we supported him with the holy spirit is it ever so that when there cometh unto you messenger from allah with that which ye yourselves desire not ye grow arrogant and some ye disbelieve and some ye slay and they say our hearts are hardened nay but allah hath cursed them for their unbelief little is that which they believe and when there cometh unto them scripture from allah confirming that in their possession though before that they were asking for signal triumph over those who disbelieved and when there cometh unto them that which they know to be the truth they disbelieve therein the curse of allah is on disbelievers evil is that for which they sell their souls that they should disbelieve in that which allah hath revealed grudging that allah should reveal of his bounty unto whom he will of his slaves they have incurred anger upon anger for disbelievers is shameful doom and when it is said unto them believe in that which allah hath revealed they say we believe in that which was revealed unto us and they disbelieve in that which cometh after it though it is the truth confirming that which they possess say unto them muhammad why then slew ye the prophets of allah aforetime if ye are indeed believers and moses came unto you with clear proofs of allah sovereignty yet while he was away ye chose the calf for worship and ye were wrong doers and when we made with you covenant and caused the mount to tower above you saying hold fast by that which we have given you and hear our word they said we hear and we rebel and worship of the calf was made to sink into their hearts because of their rejection of the covenant say unto them evil is that which your belief enjoineth on you if ye are believers say unto them if the abode of the hereafter in the providence of allah is indeed for you alone and not for others of mankind as ye pretend then long for death for ye must long for death if ye are truthful but they will never long for it because of that which their own hands have sent before them allah is aware of evil doers and thou wilt find them greediest of mankind for life and greedier than the idolaters each one of them would like to be allowed to live thousand years and to live thousand years would be no means remove him from the doom allah is seer of what they do say muhammad to mankind who is an enemy to gabriel for he it is who hath revealed this scripture to thy heart by allah leave confirming that which was revealed before it and guidance and glad tidings to believers who is an enemy to allah and his angels and his messengers and gabriel and michael then lo allah himself is an enemy to the disbelievers verily we have revealed unto thee clear tokens and only miscreants will disbelieve in them is it ever so that when they make covenant party of them set it aside the truth is most of them believe not and when there cometh unto them messenger from allah confirming that which they possess party of those who have received the scripture fling the scripture of allah behind their backs as if they knew not and follow that which the devils falsely related against the kingdom of solomon solomon disbelieved not but the devils disbelieved teaching mankind magic and that which was revealed to the two angels in babel harut and marut nor did they the two angels teach it to anyone till they had said we are only temptation therefore disbelieve not in the guidance of allah and from these two angles people learn that by which they cause division between man and wife but they injure thereby no one save by allah leave and they learn that which harmeth them and profiteth them not and surely they do know that he who trafficketh therein will have no happy portion in the hereafter and surely evil is the price for which they sell their souls if they but knew and if they had believed and kept from evil recompense from allah would be better if they only knew ye who believe say not unto the prophet listen to us but say look upon us and be ye listeners for disbelievers is painful doom neither those who disbelieve among the people of the scripture nor the idolaters love that there should be sent down unto you any good thing from your lord but allah chooseth for his mercy whom he will and allah is of infinite bounty nothing of our revelation even single verse do we abrogate or cause be forgotten but we bring in place one better or the like thereof knowest thou not that allah is able to do all things knowest thou not that it is allah unto whom belongeth the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and ye have not beside allah any guardian or helper or would ye question your messenger as moses was questioned aforetime he who chooseth disbelief instead of faith verily he hath gone astray from plain road many of the people of the scripture long to make you disbelievers after your belief through envy on their own account after the truth hath become manifest unto them forgive and be indulgent toward them until allah give command lo allah is able to do all things establish worship and pay the poor due and whatever of good ye send before you for your souls ye will find it with allah lo allah is seer of what ye do and they say none entereth paradise unless he be jew or christian these are their own desires say bring your proof of what ye state if ye are truthful nay but whosoever surrendereth his purpose to allah while doing good his reward is with his lord and there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve and the jews say the christians follow nothing true and the christians say the jews follow nothing true yet both are readers of the scripture even thus speak those who know not allah will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that wherein they differ and who doth greater wrong than he who forbiddeth the approach to the sanctuaries of allah lest his name should be mentioned therein and striveth for their ruin as for such it was never meant that they should enter them except in fear theirs in the world is ignominy and theirs in the hereafter is an awful doom unto allah belong the east and the west and whithersoever ye turn there is allah countenance lo allah is all embracing all knowing and they say allah hath taken unto himself son be he glorified nay but whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth is his all are subservient unto him the originator of the heavens and the earth when he decreeth thing he saith unto it only be and it is and those who have no knowledge say why doth not allah speak unto us or some sign come unto us even thus as they now speak spake those who were before them their hearts are all alike we have made clear the revelations for people who are sure lo we have sent thee muhammad with the truth bringer of glad tidings and warner and thou wilt not be asked about the owners of hell fire and the jews will not be pleased with thee nor will the christians till thou follow their creed say lo the guidance of allah himself is guidance and if thou shouldst follow their desires after the knowledge which hath come unto thee then wouldst thou have from allah no protecting guardian nor helper those unto whom we have given the scripture who read it with the right reading those believe in it and whoso disbelieveth in it those are they who are the losers children of israel remember my favour wherewith favoured you and how preferred you to all creatures and guard yourselves against day when no soul will in aught avail another nor will compensation be accepted from it nor will intercession be of use to it nor will they be helped and remember when his lord tried abraham with his commands and he fulfilled them he said lo have appointed thee leader for mankind abraham said and of my offspring will there be leaders he said my covenant includeth not wrong doers and when we made the house at makka resort for mankind and sanctuary saying take as your place of worship the place where abraham stood to pray and we imposed duty upon abraham and ishmael saying purify my house for those who go around and those who meditate therein and those who bow down and prostrate themselves in worship and when abraham prayed my lord make this region of security and bestow upon its people fruits such of them as believe in allah and the last day he answered as for him who disbelieveth shall leave him in contentment for while then shall compel him to the doom of fire hapless journey end and when abraham and ishmael were raising the foundations of the house abraham prayed our lord accept from us this duty lo thou only thou art the hearer the knower our lord and make us submissive unto thee and of our seed nation submissive unto thee and show us our ways of worship and relent toward us lo thou only thou art the relenting the merciful our lord and raise up in their midst messenger from among them who shall recite unto them thy revelations and shall instruct them in the scripture and in wisdom and shall make them grow lo thou only thou art the mighty wise and who forsaketh the religion of abraham save him who befooleth himself verily we chose him in the world and lo in the hereafter he is among the righteous when his lord said unto him surrender he said have surrendered to the lord of the worlds the same did abraham enjoin upon his sons and also jacob saying my sons lo allah hath chosen for you the true religion therefore die not save as men who have surrendered unto him or were ye present when death came to jacob when he said unto his sons what will ye worship after me they said we shall worship thy god the god of thy fathers abraham and ishmael and isaac one allah and unto him we have surrendered those are people who have passed away theirs is that which they earned and yours is that which ye earn and ye will not be asked of what they used to do and they say be jews or christians then ye will be rightly guided say unto them muhammad nay but we follow the religion of abraham the upright and he was not of the idolaters say muslims we believe in allah and that which is revealed unto us and that which was revealed unto abraham and ishmael and isaac and jacob and the tribes and that which moses and jesus received and that which the prophets received from their lord we make no distinction between any of them and unto him we have surrendered and if they believe in the like of that which ye believe then are they rightly guided but if they turn away then are they in schism and allah will suffice thee for defence against them he is the hearer the knower we take our colour from allah and who is better than allah at colouring we are his worshippers say unto the people of the scripture dispute ye with us concerning allah when he is our lord and your lord ours are our works and yours your works we look to him alone or say ye that abraham and ishmael and isaac and jacob and the tribes were jews or christians say do ye know best or doth allah and who is more unjust than he who hideth testimony which he hath received from allah allah is not unaware of what ye do those are people who have passed away theirs is that which they earned and yours that which ye earn and ye will not be asked of what they used to do the foolish of the people will say what hath turned them from the qiblah which they formerly observed say unto allah belong the east and the west he guideth whom he will unto straight path thus we have appointed you middle nation that ye may be witnesses against mankind and that the messenger may be witness against you and we appointed the qiblah which ye formerly observed only that we might know him who followeth the messenger from him who turneth on his heels in truth it was hard test save for those whom allah guided but it was not allah purpose that your faith should be in vain for allah is full of pity merciful toward mankind we have seen the turning of thy face to heaven for guidance muhammad and now verily we shall make thee turn in prayer toward qiblah which is dear to thee so turn thy face toward the inviolable place of worship and ye muslims wheresoever ye may be turn your faces when ye pray toward it lo those who have received the scripture know that this revelation is the truth from their lord and allah is not unaware of what they do and even if thou broughtest unto those who have received the scripture all kinds of portents they would not follow thy qiblah nor canst thou be follower of their qiblah nor are some of them followers of the qiblah of others and if thou shouldst follow their desires after the knowledge which hath come unto thee then surely wert thou of the evil doers those unto whom we gave the scripture recognise this revelation as they recognise their sons but lo party of them knowingly conceal the truth it is the truth from thy lord muhammad so be not thou of those who waver and each one hath goal toward which he turneth so vie with one another in good works wheresoever ye may be allah will bring you all together lo allah is able to do all things and whencesoever thou comest forth for prayer muhammad turn thy face toward the inviolable place of worship lo it is the truth from thy lord allah is not unaware of what ye do whencesoever thou comest forth turn thy face toward the inviolable place of worship and wheresoever ye may be muslims turn your faces toward it when ye pray so that men may have no argument against you save such of them as do injustice fear them not but fear me and so that may complete my grace upon you and that ye may be guided even as we have sent unto you messenger from among you who reciteth unto you our revelations and causeth you to grow and teacheth you the scripture and wisdom and teacheth you that which ye knew not therefore remember me will remember you give thanks to me and reject not me ye who believe seek help in steadfastness and prayer lo allah is with the steadfast and call not those who are slain in the way of allah dead nay they are living only ye perceive not and surely we shall try you with something of fear and hunger and loss of wealth and lives and crops but give glad tidings to the steadfast who say when misfortune striketh them lo we are allah and lo unto him we are returning such are they on whom are blessings from their lord and mercy such are the rightly guided lo the mountains as safa and al marwah are among the indications of allah it is therefore no sin for him who is on pilgrimage to the house of allah or visiteth it to go around them as the pagan custom is and he who doeth good of his own accord for him lo allah is responsive aware lo those who hide the proofs and the guidance which we revealed after we had made it clear to mankind in the scripture such are accursed of allah and accursed of those who have the power to curse except those who repent and amend and make manifest the truth these it is toward whom relent am the relenting the merciful lo those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers on them is the curse of allah and of angels and of men combined they ever dwell therein the doom will not be lightened for them neither will they be reprieved your allah is one allah there is no allah save him the beneficent the merciful lo in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the difference of night and day and the ships which run upon the sea with that which is of use to men and the water which allah sendeth down from the sky thereby reviving the earth after its death and dispersing all kinds of beasts therein and in the ordinance of the winds and the clouds obedient between heaven and earth are signs of allah sovereignty for people who have sense yet of mankind are some who take unto themselves objects of worship which they set as rivals to allah loving them with love like that which is the due of allah only those who believe are stauncher in their love for allah oh that those who do evil had but known on the day when they behold the doom that power belongeth wholly to allah and that allah is severe in punishment on the day when those who were followed disown those who followed them and they behold the doom and all their aims collapse with them and those who were but followers will say if return were possible for us we would disown them even as they have disowned us thus will allah show them their own deeds as anguish for them and they will not emerge from the fire mankind eat of that which is lawful and wholesome in the earth and follow not the footsteps of the devil lo he is an open enemy for you he enjoineth upon you only the evil and the foul and that ye should tell concerning allah that which ye know not and when it is said unto them follow that which allah hath revealed they say we follow that wherein we found our fathers what even though their fathers were wholly unintelligent and had no guidance the likeness of those who disbelieve in relation to the messenger is as the likeness of one who calleth unto that which heareth naught except shout and cry deaf dumb blind therefore they have no sense ye who believe eat of the good things wherewith we have provided you and render thanks to allah if it is indeed he whom ye worship he hath forbidden you only carrion and blood and swineflesh and that which hath been immolated to the name of any other than allah but he who is driven by necessity neither craving nor transgressing it is no sin for him lo allah is forgiving merciful lo those who hide aught of the scripture which allah hath revealed and purchase small gain therewith they eat into their bellies nothing else than fire allah will not speak to them on the day of resurrection nor will he make them grow theirs will be painful doom those are they who purchase error at the price of guidance and torment at the price of pardon how constant are they in their strife to reach the fire that is because allah hath revealed the scripture with the truth lo those who find cause of disagreement in the scripture are in open schism it is not righteousness that ye turn your faces to the east and the west but righteous is he who believeth in allah and the last day and the angels and the scripture and the prophets and giveth wealth for love of him to kinsfolk and to orphans and the needy and the wayfarer and to those who ask and to set slaves free and observeth proper worship and payeth the poor due and those who keep their treaty when they make one and the patient in tribulation and adversity and time of stress such are they who are sincere such are the allahfearing ye who believe retaliation is prescribed for you in the matter of the murdered the freeman for the freeman and the slave for the slave and the female for the female and for him who is forgiven somewhat by his injured brother prosecution according to usage and payment unto him in kindness this is an alleviation and mercy from your lord he who transgresseth after this will have painful doom and there is life for you in retaliation men of understanding that ye may ward off evil it is prescribed for you when death approacheth one of you if he leave wealth that he bequeath unto parents and near relatives in kindness this is duty for all those who ward off evil and whoso changeth the will after he hath heard it the sin thereof is only upon those who change it lo allah is hearer knower but he who feareth from testator some unjust or sinful clause and maketh peace between the parties it shall be no sin for him lo allah is forgiving merciful ye who believe fasting is prescribed for you even as it was prescribed for those before you that ye may ward off evil fast certain number of days and for him who is sick among you or on journey the same number of other days and for those who can afford it there is ransom the feeding of man in need but whoso doeth good of his own accord it is better for him and that ye fast is better for you if ye did but know the month of ramadan in which was revealed the qur an guidance for mankind and clear proofs of the guidance and the criterion of right and wrong and whosoever of you is present let him fast the month and whosoever of you is sick or on journey let him fast the same number of other days allah desireth for you ease he desireth not hardship for you and he desireth that ye should complete the period and that ye should magnify allah for having guided you and that peradventure ye may be thankful and when my servants question thee concerning me then surely am nigh answer the prayer of the suppliant when he crieth unto me so let them hear my call and let them trust in me in order that they may be led aright it is made lawful for you to go in unto your wives on the night of the fast they are raiment for you and ye are raiment for them allah is aware that ye were deceiving yourselves in this respect and he hath turned in mercy toward you and relieved you so hold intercourse with them and seek that which allah hath ordained for you and eat and drink until the white thread becometh distinct to you from the black thread of the dawn then strictly observe the fast till nightfall and touch them not but be at your devotions in the mosques these are the limits imposed by allah so approach them not thus allah expoundeth his revelation to mankind that they may ward off evil and eat not up your property among yourselves in vanity nor seek by it to gain the hearing of the judges that ye may knowingly devour portion of the property of others wrongfully they ask thee muhammad of new moons say they are fixed seasons for mankind and for the pilgrimage it is not righteousness that ye go to houses by the backs thereof as do the idolaters at certain seasons but the righteous man is he who wardeth off evil so go to houses by the gates thereof and observe your duty to allah that ye may be successful fight in the way of allah against those who fight against you but begin not hostilities lo allah loveth not aggressors no please don kill anyone thanks but if they desist then lo allah is forgiving merciful and fight them until persecution is no more and religion is for allah but if they desist then let there be no hostility except against wrong doers the forbidden month for the forbidden month and forbidden things in retaliation and one who attacketh you attack him in like manner as he attacked you observe your duty to allah and know that allah is with those who ward off evil spend your wealth for the cause of allah and be not cast by your own hands to ruin and do good lo allah loveth the beneficent perform the pilgrimage and the visit to makka for allah and if ye are prevented then send such gifts as can be obtained with ease and shave not your heads until the gifts have reached their destination and whoever among you is sick or hath an ailment of the head must pay ransom of fasting or almsgiving or offering and if ye are in safety then whosoever contenteth himself with the visit for the pilgrimage shall give such gifts as can be had with ease and whosoever cannot find such gifts then fast of three days while on the pilgrimage and of seven when ye have returned that is ten in all that is for him whoso folk are not present at the inviolable place of worship observe your duty to allah and know that allah is severe in punishment the pilgrimage is in the well known months and whoever is minded to perform the pilgrimage therein let him remember that there is to be no lewdness nor abuse nor angry conversation on the pilgrimage and whatsoever good ye do allah knoweth it so make provision for yourselves hereafter for the best provision is to ward off evil therefore keep your duty unto me men of understanding it is no sin for you that ye seek the bounty of your lord by trading but when ye press on in the multitude from arafat remember allah by the sacred monument remember him as he hath guided you although before ye were of those astray then hasten onward from the place whence the multitude hasteneth onward and ask forgiveness of allah lo allah is forgiving merciful and when ye have completed your devotions then remember allah as ye remember your fathers or with more lively remembrance but of mankind is he who saith our lord give unto us in the world and he hath no portion in the hereafter and of them also is he who saith our lord give unto us in the world that which is good and in the hereafter that which is good and guard us from the doom of fire for them there is in store goodly portion out of that which they have earned allah is swift at reckoning remember allah through the appointed days then whoso hasteneth his departure by two days it is no sin for him and whoso delayeth it is no sin for him that is for him who wardeth off evil be careful of your duty to allah and know that unto him ye will be gathered and of mankind there is he whoso conversation on the life of this world pleaseth thee muhammad and he calleth allah to witness as to that which is in his heart yet he is the most rigid of opponents and when he turneth away from thee his effort in the land is to make mischief therein and to destroy the crops and the cattle and allah loveth not mischief and when it is said unto him be careful of thy duty to allah pride taketh him to sin hell will settle his account an evil resting place and of mankind is he who would sell himself seeking the pleasure of allah and allah hath compassion on his bondmen ye who believe come all of you into submission unto him and follow not the footsteps of the devil lo he is an open enemy for you and if ye slide back after the clear proofs have come unto you then know that allah is mighty wise wait they for naught else than that allah should come unto them in the shadows of the clouds with the angels then the case would be already judged all cases go back to allah for judgment ask of the children of israel how many clear revelation we gave them he who altereth the grace of allah after it hath come unto him for him lo allah is severe in punishment beautified is the life of the world for those who disbelieve they make jest of the believers but those who keep their duty to allah will be above them on the day of resurrection allah giveth without stint to whom he will mankind were one community and allah sent unto them prophets as bearers of good tidings and as warners and revealed therewith the scripture with the truth that it might judge between mankind concerning that wherein they differed and only those unto whom the scripture was given differed concerning it after clear proofs had come unto them through hatred one of another and allah by his will guided those who believe unto the truth of that concerning which they differed allah guideth whom he will unto straight path or think ye that ye will enter paradise while yet there hath not come unto you the like of that which came to those who passed away before you affliction and adversity befell them they were shaken as with earthquake till the messenger of allah and those who believed along with him said when cometh allah help now surely allah help is nigh they ask thee muhammad what they shall spend say that which ye spend for good must go to parents and near kindred and orphans and the needy and the wayfarer and whatsoever good ye do lo allah is aware of it warfare is ordained for you though it is hateful unto you but it may happen that ye hate thing which is good for you and it may happen that ye love thing which is bad for you allah knoweth ye know not they question thee muhammad with regard to warfare in the sacred month say warfare therein is great transgression but to turn men from the way of allah and to disbelieve in him and in the inviolable place of worship and to expel his people thence is greater with allah for persecution is worse than killing and they will not cease from fighting against you till they have made you renegades from your religion if they can and whoso becometh renegade and dieth in his disbelief such are they whose works have fallen both in the world and the hereafter such are rightful owners of the fire they will abide therein lo those who believe and those who emigrate to escape the persecution and strive in the way of allah these have hope of allah mercy allah is forgiving merciful they question thee about strong drink and games of chance say in both is great sin and some utility for men but the sin of them is greater than their usefulness and they ask thee what they ought to spend say that which is superfluous thus allah maketh plain to you his revelations that haply ye may reflect upon the world and the hereafter and they question thee concerning orphans say to improve their lot is best and if ye mingle your affairs with theirs then they are your brothers allah knoweth him who spoileth from him who improveth had allah willed he could have overburdened you allah is mighty wise wed not idolatresses till they believe for lo believing bondwoman is better than an idolatress though she please you and give not your daughters in marriage to idolaters till they believe for lo believing slave is better than an idolater though he please you these invite unto the fire and allah inviteth unto the garden and unto forgiveness by his grace and expoundeth his revelations to mankind that haply they may remember they question thee muhammad concerning menstruation say it is an illness so let women alone at such times and go not in unto them till they are cleansed and when they have purified themselves then go in unto them as allah hath enjoined upon you truly allah loveth those who turn unto him and loveth those who have care for cleanness your women are tilth for you to cultivate so go to your tilth as ye will and send good deeds before you for your souls and fear allah and know that ye will one day meet him give glad tidings to believers muhammad and make not allah by your oaths hindrance to your being righteous and observing your duty unto him and making peace among mankind allah is hearer knower allah will not take you to task for that which is unintentional in your oaths but he will take you to task for that which your hearts have garnered allah is forgiving clement those who forswear their wives must wait four months then if they change their mind lo allah is forgiving merciful and if they decide upon divorce let them remember that allah is hearer knower women who are divorced shall wait keeping themselves apart three monthly courses and it is not lawful for them that they should conceal that which allah hath created in their wombs if they are believers in allah and the last day and their husbands would do better to take them back in that case if they desire reconciliation and they women have rights similar to those of men over them in kindness and men are degree above them allah is mighty wise divorce must be pronounced twice and then woman must be retained in honour or released in kindness and it is not lawful for you that ye take from women aught of that which ye have given them except in the case when both fear that they may not be able to keep within the limits imposed by allah and if ye fear that they may not be able to keep the limits of allah in that case it is no sin for either of them if the woman ransom herself these are the limits imposed by allah transgress them not for whoso transgresseth allah limits such are wrong doers and if he hath divorced her the third time then she is not lawful unto him thereafter until she hath wedded another husband then if he the other husband divorce her it is no sin for both of them that they come together again if they consider that they are able to observe the limits of allah these are the limits of allah he manifesteth them for people who have knowledge when ye have divorced women and they have reached their term then retain them in kindness or release them in kindness retain them not to their hurt so that ye transgress the limits he who doeth that hath wronged his soul make not the revelations of allah laughing stock by your behaviour but remember allah grace upon you and that which he hath revealed unto you of the scripture and of wisdom whereby he doth exhort you observe your duty to allah and know that allah is aware of all things and when ye have divorced women and they reach their term place not difficulties in the way of their marrying their husbands if it is agreed between them in kindness this is an admonition for him among you who believeth in allah and the last day that is more virtuous for you and cleaner allah knoweth ye know not mothers shall suckle their children for two whole years that is for those who wish to complete the suckling the duty of feeding and clothing nursing mothers in seemly manner is upon the father of the child no one should be charged beyond his capacity mother should not be made to suffer because of her child nor should he to whom the child is born be made to suffer because of his child and on the father heir is incumbent the like of that which was incumbent on the father if they desire to wean the child by mutual consent and after consultation it is no sin for them and if ye wish to give your children out to nurse it is no sin for you provide that ye pay what is due from you in kindness observe your duty to allah and know that allah is seer of what ye do such of you as die and leave behind them wives they the wives shall wait keeping themselves apart four months and ten days and when they reach the term prescribed for them then there is no sin for you in aught that they may do with themselves in decency allah is informed of what ye do there is no sin for you in that which ye proclaim or hide in your minds concerning your troth with women allah knoweth that ye will remember them but plight not your troth with women except by uttering recognised form of words and do not consummate the marriage until the term prescribed is run know that allah knoweth what is in your minds so beware of him and know that allah is forgiving clement it is no sin for you if ye divorce women while yet ye have not touched them nor appointed unto them portion provide for them the rich according to his means and the straitened according to his means fair provision this is bounden duty for those who do good if ye divorce them before ye have touched them and ye have appointed unto them portion then pay the half of that which ye appointed unless they the women agree to forgo it or he agreeth to forgo it in whose hand is the marriage tie to forgo is nearer to piety and forget not kindness among yourselves allah is seer of what ye do be guardians of your prayers and of the midmost prayer and stand up with devotion to allah and if ye go in fear then pray standing or on horseback and when ye are again in safety remember allah as he hath taught you that which heretofore ye knew not in the case of those of you who are about to die and leave behind them wives they should bequeath unto their wives provision for the year without turning them out but if they go out of their own accord there is no sin for you in that which they do of themselves within their rights allah is mighty wise for divorced women provision in kindness duty for those who ward off evil thus allah expoundeth unto you his revelations so that ye may understand bethink thee muhammad of those of old who went forth from their habitations in their thousands fearing death and allah said unto them die and then he brought them back to life lo allah is lord of kindness to mankind but most of mankind give not thanks fight in the way of allah and know that allah is hearer knower who is it that will lend unto allah goodly loan so that he may give it increase manifold allah straiteneth and enlargeth unto him ye will return bethink thee of the leaders of the children of israel after moses how they said unto prophet whom they had set up for us king and we will fight in allah way he said would ye then refrain from fighting if fighting were prescribed for you they said why should we not fight in allah way when we have been driven from our dwellings with our children yet when fighting was prescribed for them they turned away all save few of them allah is aware of evil doers their prophet said unto them lo allah hath raised up saul to be king for you they said how can he have kingdom over us when we are more deserving of the kingdom than he is since he hath not been given wealth enough he said lo allah hath chosen him above you and hath increased him abundantly in wisdom and stature allah bestoweth his sovereignty on whom he will allah is allembracing all knowing and their prophet said unto them lo the token of his kingdom is that there shall come unto you the ark wherein is peace of reassurance from your lord and remnant of that which the house of moses and the house of aaron left behind the angels bearing it lo herein shall be token for you if in truth ye are believers and when saul set out with the army he said lo allah will try you by the ordeal of river whosoever therefore drinketh thereof he is not of me and whosoever tasteth it not he is of me save him who taketh thereof in the hollow of his hand but they drank thereof all save few of them and after he had crossed the river he and those who believed with him they said we have no power this day against goliath and his hosts but those who knew that they would meet allah exclaimed how many little company hath overcome mighty host by allah leave allah is with the steadfast and when they went into the field against goliath and his hosts they said our lord bestow on us endurance make our foothold sure and give us help against the disbelieving folk so they routed them by allah leave and david slew goliath and allah gave him the kingdom and wisdom and taught him of that which he willeth and if allah had not repelled some men by others the earth would have been corrupted but allah is lord of kindness to his creatures these are the portents of allah which we recite unto thee muhammad with truth and lo thou art of the number of our messengers of those messengers some of whom we have caused to excel others and of whom there are some unto whom allah spake while some of them he exalted above others in degree and we gave jesus son of mary clear proofs of allah sovereignty and we supported him with the holy spirit and if allah had so wiled it those who followed after them would not have fought one with another after the clear proofs had come unto them but they differed some of them believing and some disbelieving and if allah had so willed it they would not have fought one with another but allah doeth what he will ye who believe spend of that wherewith we have provided you ere day come when there will be no trafficking nor friendship nor intercession the disbelievers they are the wrong doers allah there is no deity save him the alive the eternal neither slumber nor sleep overtaketh him unto him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth who is he that intercedeth with him save by his leave he knoweth that which is in front of them and that which is behind them while they encompass nothing of his knowledge save what he will his throne includeth the heavens and the earth and he is never weary of preserving them he is the sublime the tremendous there is no compulsion in religion the right direction is henceforth distinct from error and he who rejecteth false deities and believeth in allah hath grasped firm handhold which will never break allah is hearer knower allah is the protecting guardian of those who believe he bringeth them out of darkness into light as for those who disbelieve their patrons are false deities they bring them out of light into darkness such are rightful owners of the fire they will abide therein bethink thee of him who had an argument with abraham about his lord because allah had given him the kingdom how when abraham said my lord is he who giveth life and causeth death he answered give life and cause death abraham said lo allah causeth the sun to rise in the east so do thou cause it to come up from the west thus was the disbeliever abashed and allah guideth not wrongdoing folk or bethink thee of the like of him who passing by township which had fallen into utter ruin exclaimed how shall allah give this township life after its death and allah made him die hundred years then brought him back to life he said how long hast thou tarried the man said have tarried day or part of day he said nay but thou hast tarried for hundred years just look at thy food and drink which have not rotted look at thine ass and that we may make thee token unto mankind look at the bones how we adjust them and then cover them with flesh and when the matter became clear unto him he said know now that allah is able to do all things and when abraham said unto his lord my lord show me how thou givest life to the dead he said dost thou not believe abraham said yea but ask in order that my heart may be at ease his lord said take four of the birds and cause them to incline unto thee then place part of them on each hill then call them they will come to thee in haste and know that allah is mighty wise the likeness of those who spend their wealth in allah way is as the likeness of grain which groweth seven ears in every ear hundred grains allah giveth increase manifold to whom he will allah is all embracing allknowing those who spend their wealth for the cause of allah and afterward make not reproach and injury to follow that which they have spent their reward is with their lord and there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve kind word with forgiveness is better than almsgiving followed by injury allah is absolute clement ye who believe render not vain your almsgiving by reproach and injury like him who spendeth his wealth only to be seen of men and believeth not in allah and the last day his likeness is as the likeness of rock whereon is dust of earth rainstorm smiteth it leaving it smooth and bare they have no control of aught of that which they have gained allah guideth not the disbelieving folk and the likeness of those who spend their wealth in search of allah pleasure and for the strengthening of their souls is as the likeness of garden on height the rainstorm smiteth it and it bringeth forth its fruit twofold and if the rainstorm smite it not then the shower allah is seer of what ye do would any of you like to have garden of palm trees and vines with rivers flowing underneath it with all kinds of fruit for him therein and old age hath stricken him and he hath feeble offspring and fiery whirlwind striketh it and it is all consumed by fire thus allah maketh plain his revelations unto you in order that ye may give thought ye who believe spend of the good things which ye have earned and of that which we bring forth from the earth for you and seek not the bad with intent to spend thereof in charity when ye would not take it for yourselves save with disdain and know that allah is absolute owner of praise the devil promiseth you destitution and enjoineth on you lewdness but allah promiseth you forgiveness from himself with bounty allah is allembracing all knowing he giveth wisdom unto whom he will and he unto whom wisdom is given he truly hath received abundant good but none remember except men of understanding whatever alms ye spend or vow ye vow lo allah knoweth it wrong doers have no helpers if ye publish your almsgiving it is well but if ye hide it and give it to the poor it will be better for you and will atone for some of your ill deeds allah is informed of what ye do the guiding of them is not thy duty muhammad but allah guideth whom he will and whatsoever good thing ye spend it is for yourselves when ye spend not save in search of allah countenance and whatsoever good thing ye spend it will be repaid to you in full and ye will not be wronged alms are for the poor who are straitened for the cause of allah who cannot travel in the land for trade the unthinking man accounteth them wealthy because of their restraint thou shalt know them by their mark they do not beg of men with importunity and whatsoever good thing ye spend lo allah knoweth it those who spend their wealth by night and day by stealth and openly verily their reward is with their lord and their shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve those who swallow usury cannot rise up save as he ariseth whom the devil hath prostrated by his touch that is because they say trade is just like usury whereas allah permitteth trading and forbiddeth usury he unto whom an admonition from his lord cometh and he refraineth in obedience thereto he shall keep the profits of that which is past and his affair henceforth is with allah as for him who returneth to usury such are rightful owners of the fire they will abide therein allah hath blighted usury and made almsgiving fruitful allah loveth not the impious and guilty lo those who believe and do good works and establish worship and pay the poor due their reward is with their lord and there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve ye who believe observe your duty to allah and give up what remaineth due to you from usury if ye are in truth believers and if ye do not then be warned of war against you from allah and his messenger and if ye repent then ye have your principal without interest wrong not and ye shall not be wronged and if the debtor is in straitened circumstances then let there be postponement to the time of ease and that ye remit the debt as almsgiving would be better for you if ye did but know and guard yourselves against day in which ye will be brought back to allah then every soul will be paid in full that which it hath earned and they will not be wronged ye who believe when ye contract debt for fixed term record it in writing let scribe record it in writing between you in terms of equity no scribe should refuse to write as allah hath taught him so let him write and let him who incurreth the debt dictate and let him observe his duty to allah his lord and diminish naught thereof but if he who oweth the debt is of low understanding or weak or unable himself to dictate then let the guardian of his interests dictate in terms of equity and call to witness from among your men two witnesses and if two men be not at hand then man and two women of such as ye approve as witnesses so that if the one erreth through forgetfulness the other will remember and the witnesses must not refuse when they are summoned be not averse to writing down the contract whether it be small or great with record of the term thereof that is more equitable in the sight of allah and more sure for testimony and the best way of avoiding doubt between you save only in the case when it is actual merchandise which ye transfer among yourselves from hand to hand in that case it is no sin for you if ye write it not and have witnesses when ye sell one to another and let no harm be done to scribe or witness if ye do harm to them lo it is sin in you observe your duty to allah allah is teaching you and allah is knower of all things if ye be on journey and cannot find scribe then pledge in hand shall suffice and if one of you entrusteth to another let him who is trusted deliver up that which is entrusted to him according to the pact between them and let him observe his duty to allah his lord hide not testimony he who hideth it verily his heart is sinful allah is aware of what ye do unto allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth and whether ye make known what is in your minds or hide it allah will bring you to account for it he will forgive whom he will and he will punish whom he will allah is able to do all things the messenger believeth in that which hath been revealed unto him from his lord and so do believers each one believeth in allah and his angels and his scriptures and his messengers we make no distinction between any of his messengers and they say we hear and we obey grant us thy forgiveness our lord unto thee is the journeying allah tasketh not soul beyond its scope for it is only that which it hath earned and against it only that which it hath deserved our lord condemn us not if we forget or miss the mark our lord lay not on us such burden as thou didst lay on those before us our lord impose not on us that which we have not the strength to bear pardon us absolve us and have mercy on us thou our protector and give us victory over the disbelieving folk sura al imran the family of imran the house of imran alim lam mim allah there is no allah save him the alive the eternal he hath revealed unto thee muhammad the scripture with truth confirming that which was revealed before it even as he revealed the torah and the gospel aforetime for guidance to mankind and hath revealed the criterion of right and wrong lo those who disbelieve the revelations of allah theirs will be heavy doom allah is mighty able to requite the wrong lo nothing in the earth or in the heavens is hidden from allah he it is who fashioneth you in the wombs as pleaseth him there is no allah save him the almighty the wise he it is who hath revealed unto thee muhammad the scripture wherein are clear revelations they are the substance of the book and others which are allegorical but those in whose hearts is doubt pursue forsooth that which is allegorical seeking to cause dissension by seeking to explain it none knoweth its explanation save allah and those who are of sound instruction say we believe therein the whole is from our lord but only men of understanding really heed our lord cause not our hearts to stray after thou hast guided us and bestow upon us mercy from thy presence lo thou only thou art the bestower our lord lo it is thou who gatherest mankind together to day of which there is no doubt lo allah faileth not to keep the tryst on that day neither the riches nor the progeny of those who disbelieve will aught avail them with allah they will be fuel for fire like pharaoh folk and those who were before them they disbelieved our revelations and so allah seized them for their sins and allah is severe in punishment say muhammad unto those who disbelieve ye shall be overcome and gathered unto hell an evil resting place there was token for you in two hosts which met one army fighting in the way of allah and another disbelieving whom they saw as twice their number clearly with their very eyes thus allah strengtheneth with his succour whom he will lo herein verily is lesson for those who have eyes beautified for mankind is love of the joys that come from women and offspring and stored up heaps of gold and silver and horses branded with their mark and cattle and land that is comfort of the life of the world allah with him is more excellent abode say shall inform you of something better than that for those who keep from evil with their lord are gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide and pure companions and contentment from allah allah is seer of his bondmen those who say our lord lo we believe so forgive us our sins and guard us from the punishment of fire the steadfast and the truthful and the obedient those who spend and hoard not those who pray for pardon in the watches of the night allah himself is witness that there is no allah save him and the angels and the men of learning too are witness maintaining his creation in justice there is no allah save him the almighty the wise lo religion with allah is the surrender to his will and guidance those who formerly received the scripture differed only after knowledge came unto them through transgression among themselves whoso disbelieveth the revelations of allah will find that lo allah is swift at reckoning and if they argue with thee muhammad say purpose to allah and so have those who follow me received the scripture and those who read not have they surrender then truly they are rightly guided have surrendered my and say unto those who have ye too surrendered if and if they turn away then it is thy duty only to convey the message unto them allah is seer of his bondmen lo those who disbelieve the revelations of allah and slay the prophets wrongfully and slay those of mankind who enjoin equity promise them painful doom those are they whose works have failed in the world and the hereafter and they have no helpers hast thou not seen how those who have received portion of the scripture invoke the scripture of allah in their disputes that it may judge between them then faction of them turn away being opposed to it that is because they say the fire will not touch us save for certain number of days that which they used to invent hath deceived them regarding their religion how will it be with them when we have brought them all together to day of which there is no doubt when every soul will be paid in full what it hath earned and they will not be wronged say allah owner of sovereignty thou givest sovereignty unto whom thou wilt and thou withdrawest sovereignty from whom thou wilt thou exaltest whom thou wilt and thou abasest whom thou wilt in thy hand is the good lo thou art able to do all things thou causest the night to pass into the day and thou causest the day to pass into the night and thou bringest forth the living from the dead and thou bringest forth the dead from the living and thou givest sustenance to whom thou choosest without stint let not the believers take disbelievers for their friends in preference to believers whoso doeth that hath no connection with allah unless it be that ye but guard yourselves against them taking as it were security allah biddeth you beware only of himself unto allah is the journeying say muhammad whether ye hide that which is in your breasts or reveal it allah knoweth it he knoweth that which is in the heavens and that which is in the earth and allah is able to do all things on the day when every soul will find itself confronted with all that it hath done of good and all that it hath done of evil every soul will long that there might be mighty space of distance between it and that evil allah biddeth you beware of him and allah is full of pity for his bondmen say muhammad to mankind if ye love allah follow me allah will love you and forgive you your sins allah is forgiving merciful say obey allah and the messenger but if they turn away lo allah loveth not the disbelievers in his guidance lo allah preferred adam and noah and the family of abraham and the family of imran above all his creatures they were descendants one of another allah is hearer knower remember when the wife of imran said my lord have vowed unto thee that which is in my belly as consecrated offering accept it from me lo thou only thou art the hearer the knower and when she was delivered she said my lord lo am delivered of female allah knew best of what she was delivered the male is not as the female and lo have named her mary and lo crave thy protection for her and for her offspring from satan the outcast and her lord accepted her with full acceptance and vouchsafed to her goodly growth and made zachariah her guardian whenever zachariah went into the sanctuary where she was he found that she had food he said mary whence cometh unto thee this food she answered it is from allah allah giveth without stint to whom he will then zachariah prayed unto his lord and said my lord bestow upon me of thy bounty goodly offspring lo thou art the hearer of prayer and the angels called to him as he stood praying in the sanctuary allah giveth thee glad tidings of son whose name is john who cometh to confirm word from allah lordly chaste prophet of the righteous he said my lord how can have son when age hath overtaken me already and my wife is barren the angel answered so it will be allah doeth what he will he said my lord appoint token for me the angel said the token unto thee shall be that thou shalt not speak unto mankind three days except by signs remember thy lord much and praise him in the early hours of night and morning and when the angels said mary lo allah hath chosen thee and made thee pure and hath preferred thee above all the women of creation mary be obedient to thy lord prostrate thyself and bow with those who bow in worship this is of the tidings of things hidden we reveal it unto thee muhammad thou wast not present with them when they threw their pens to know which of them should be the guardian of mary nor wast thou present with them when they quarrelled thereupon and remember when the angels said mary lo allah giveth thee glad tidings of word from him whose name is the messiah jesus son of mary illustrious in the world and the hereafter and one of those brought near unto allah he will speak unto mankind in his cradle and in his manhood and he is of the righteous she said my lord how can have child when no mortal hath touched me he said so it will be allah createth what he will if he decreeth thing he saith unto it only be and it is and he will teach him the scripture and wisdom and the torah and the gospel and will make him messenger unto the children of israel saying lo come unto you with sign from your lord lo fashion for you out of clay the likeness of bird and breathe into it and it is bird by allah leave heal him who was born blind and the leper and raise the dead by allah leave and announce unto you what ye eat and what ye store up in your houses lo herein verily is portent for you if ye are to be believers and come confirming that which was before me of the torah and to make lawful some of that which was forbidden unto you come unto you with sign from your lord so keep your duty to allah and obey me lo allah is my lord and your lord so worship him that is straight path but when jesus became conscious of their disbelief he cried who will be my helpers in the cause of allah the disciples said we will be allah helpers we believe in allah and bear thou witness that we have surrendered unto him our lord we believe in that which thou hast revealed and we follow him whom thou hast sent enrol us among those who witness to the truth and they the disbelievers schemed and allah schemed against them and allah is the best of schemers and remember when allah said jesus lo am gathering thee and causing thee to ascend unto me and am cleansing thee of those who disbelieve and am setting those who follow thee above those who disbelieve until the day of resurrection then unto me ye will all return and shall judge between you as to that wherein ye used to differ as for those who disbelieve shall chastise them with heavy chastisement in the world and the hereafter and they will have no helpers and as for those who believe and do good works he will pay them their wages in full allah loveth not wrong doers this which we recite unto thee is revelation and wise reminder lo the likeness of jesus with allah is as the likeness of adam he created him of dust then he said unto him be and he is this is the truth from thy lord muhammad so be not thou of those who waver and whoso disputeth with thee concerning him after the knowledge which hath come unto thee say unto him come we will summon our sons and your sons and our women and your women and ourselves and yourselves then we will pray humbly to our lord and solemnly invoke the curse of allah upon those who lie lo this verily is the true narrative there is no allah save allah and lo allah he verily is is the mighty the wise and if they turn away then lo allah is aware of who are the corrupters say people of the scripture come to an agreement between us and you that we shall worship none but allah and that we shall ascribe no partner unto him and that none of us shall take others for lords beside allah and if they turn away then say bear witness that we are they who have surrendered unto him people of the scripture why will ye argue about abraham when the torah and the gospel were not revealed till after him have ye then no sense lo ye are those who argue about that whereof ye have some knowledge why then argue ye concerning that whereof ye have no knowledge allah knoweth ye know not abraham was not jew nor yet christian but he was an upright man who had surrendered to allah and he was not of the idolaters lo those of mankind who have the best claim to abraham are those who followed him and this prophet and those who believe with him and allah is the protecting guardian of the believers party of the people of the scripture long to make you go astray and they make none to go astray except themselves but they perceive not people of the scripture why disbelieve ye in the revelations of allah when ye yourselves bear witness to their truth people of the scripture why confound ye truth with falsehood and knowingly conceal the truth and party of the people of the scripture say believe in that which hath been revealed unto those who believe at the opening of the day and disbelieve at the end thereof in order that they may return and believe not save in one who followeth your religion say muhammad lo the guidance is allah guidance that anyone is given the like of that which was given unto you or that they may argue with you in the presence of their lord say muhammad lo the bounty is in allah hand he bestoweth it on whom he will allah is all embracing all knowing he selecteth for his mercy whom he will allah is of infinite bounty among the people of the scripture there is he who if thou trust him with weight of treasure will return it to thee and among them there is he who if thou trust him with piece of gold will not return it to thee unless thou keep standing over him that is because they say we have no duty to the gentiles they speak lie concerning allah knowingly nay but the chosen of allah is he who fulfilleth his pledge and wardeth off evil for lo allah loveth those who ward off evil lo those who purchase small gain at the cost of allah covenant and their oaths they have no portion in the hereafter allah will neither speak to them nor look upon them on the day of resurrection nor will he make them grow theirs will be painful doom and lo there is party of them who distort the scripture with their tongues that ye may think that what they say is from the scripture when it is not from the scripture and they say it is from allah when it is not from allah and they speak lie concerning allah knowingly it is not possible for any human being unto whom allah had given the scripture and wisdom and the prophethood that he should afterwards have said unto mankind be slaves of me instead of allah but what he said was be ye faithful servants of the lord by virtue of your constant teaching of the scripture and of your constant study thereof and he commanded you not that ye should take the angels and the prophets for lords would he command you to disbelieve after ye had surrendered to allah when allah made his covenant with the prophets he said behold that which have given you of the scripture and knowledge and afterward there will come unto you messenger confirming that which ye possess ye shall believe in him and ye shall help him he said do ye agree and will ye take up my burden which lay upon you in this matter they answered we agree he said then bear ye witness will be witness with you then whosoever after this shall turn away they will be miscreants seek they other than the religion of allah when unto him submitteth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth willingly or unwillingly and unto him they will be returned say muhammad we believe in allah and that which is revealed unto us and that which was revealed unto abraham and ishmael and isaac and jacob and the tribes and that which was vouchsafed unto moses and jesus and the prophets from their lord we make no distinction between any of them and unto him we have surrendered and whoso seeketh as religion other than the surrender to allah it will not be accepted from him and he will be loser in the hereafter how shall allah guide people who disbelieved after their belief and after they bore witness that the messenger is true and after clear proofs of allah sovereignty had come unto them and allah guideth not wrongdoing folk as for such their guerdon is that on them rests the curse of allah and of angels and of men combined they will abide therein their doom will not be lightened neither will they be reprieved save those who afterward repent and do right lo allah is forgiving merciful lo those who disbelieve after their profession of belief and afterward grow violent in disbelief their repentance will not be accepted and such are those who are astray lo those who disbelieve and die in disbelief the whole earth full of gold would not be accepted from such an one if it were offered as ransom for his soul theirs will be painful doom and they will have no helpers ye will not attain unto piety until ye spend of that which ye love and whatsoever ye spend allah is aware thereof all food was lawful unto the children of israel save that which israel forbade himself in days before the torah was revealed say produce the torah and read it unto us if ye are truthful and whoever shall invent falsehood after that concerning allah such will be wrong doers say allah speaketh truth so follow the religion of abraham the upright he was not of the idolaters lo the first sanctuary appointed for mankind was that at becca blessed place guidance to the peoples wherein are plain memorials of allah guidance the place where abraham stood up to pray and whosoever entereth it is safe and pilgrimage to the house is duty unto allah for mankind for him who can find way thither as for him who disbelieveth let him know that lo allah is independent of all creatures say people of the scripture why disbelieve ye in the revelations of allah when allah himself is witness of what ye do say people of the scripture why drive ye back believers from the way of allah seeking to make it crooked when ye are witnesses to allah guidance allah is not unaware of what ye do ye who believe if ye obey party of those who have received the scripture they will make you disbelievers after your belief how can ye disbelieve when it is ye unto whom allah revelations are recited and his messenger is in your midst he who holdeth fast to allah he indeed is guided unto right path ye who believe observe your duty to allah with right observance and die not save as those who have surrendered unto him and hold fast all of you together to the cable of allah and do not separate and remember allah favour unto you how ye were enemies and he made friendship between your hearts so that ye became as brothers by his grace and how ye were upon the brink of an abyss of fire and he did save you from it thus allah maketh clear his revelations unto you that haply ye may be guided and there may spring from you nation who invite to goodness and enjoin right conduct and forbid indecency such are they who are successful and be ye not as those who separated and disputed after the clear proofs had come unto them for such there is an awful doom on the day when some faces will be whitened and some faces will be blackened and as for those whose faces have been blackened it will be said unto them disbelieved ye after your profession of belief then taste the punishment for that ye disbelieved and as for those whose faces have been whitened in the mercy of allah they dwell for ever these are revelations of allah we recite them unto thee in truth allah willeth no injustice to his creatures unto allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth and unto allah all things are returned ye are the best community that hath been raised up for mankind ye enjoin right conduct and forbid indecency and ye believe in allah and if the people of the scripture had believed it had been better for them some of them are believers but most of them are evil livers they will not harm you save trifling hurt and if they fight against you they will turn and flee and afterward they will not be helped ignominy shall be their portion wheresoever they are found save where they grasp rope from allah and rope from men they have incurred anger from their lord and wretchedness is laid upon them that is because they used to disbelieve the revelations of allah and slew the prophets wrongfully that is because they were rebellious and used to transgress they are not all alike of the people of the scripture there is staunch community who recite the revelations of allah in the night season falling prostrate before him they believe in allah and the last day and enjoin right conduct and forbid indecency and vie one with another in good works these are of the righteous and whatever good they do they will not be denied the meed thereof allah is aware of those who ward off evil lo the riches and the progeny of those who disbelieve will not avail them aught against allah and such are rightful owners of the fire they will abide therein the likeness of that which they spend in this life of the world is as the likeness of biting icy wind which smiteth the harvest of people who have wronged themselves and devastateth it allah wronged them not but they do wrong themselves ye who believe take not for intimates others than your own folk who would spare no pains to ruin you they love to hamper you hatred is revealed by the utterance of their mouths but that which their breasts hide is greater we have made plain for you the revelations if ye will understand lo ye are those who love them though they love you not and ye believe in all the scripture when they fall in with you they say we believe but when they go apart they bite their finger tips at you for rage say perish in your rage lo allah is aware of what is hidden in your breasts if lucky chance befall you it is evil unto them and if disaster strike you they rejoice thereat but if ye persevere and keep from evil their guile will never harm you lo allah is surrounding what they do and when thou settedst forth at daybreak from thy housefolk to assign to the believers their positions for the battle allah was hearer knower when two parties of you almost fell away and allah was their protecting friend in allah let believers put their trust allah had already given you the victory at badr when ye were contemptible so observe your duty to allah in order that ye may be thankful when thou didst say unto the believers is it not sufficient for you that your lord should support you with three thousand angels sent down to your help nay but if ye persevere and keep from evil and the enemy attack you suddenly your lord will help you with five thousand angels sweeping on allah ordained this only as message of good cheer for you and that thereby your hearts might be at rest victory cometh only from allah the mighty the wise that he may cut off part of those who disbelieve or overwhelm them so that they retire frustrated it is no concern at all of thee muhammad whether he relent toward them or punish them for they are evil doers unto allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth he forgiveth whom he will and punisheth whom he will allah is forgiving merciful ye who believe devour not usury doubling and quadrupling the sum lent observe your duty to allah that ye may be successful and ward off from yourselves the fire prepared for disbelievers and obey allah and the messenger that ye may find mercy and vie one with another for forgiveness from your lord and for paradise as wide as are the heavens and the earth prepared for those who ward off evil those who spend of that which allah hath given them in ease and in adversity those who control their wrath and are forgiving toward mankind allah loveth the good and those who when they do an evil thing or wrong themselves remember allah and implore forgiveness for their sins who forgiveth sins save allah only and will not knowingly repeat the wrong they did the reward of such will be forgiveness from their lord and gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide for ever bountiful reward for workers systems have passed away before you do but travel in the land and see the nature of the consequence for those who did deny the messengers this is declaration for mankind guidance and an admonition unto those who ward off evil faint not nor grieve for ye will overcome them if ye are indeed believers if ye have received blow the disbelieving people have received blow the like thereof these are only the vicissitudes which we cause to follow one another for mankind to the end that allah may know those who believe and may choose witnesses from among you and allah loveth not wrong doers and that allah may prove those who believe and may blight the disbelievers or deemed ye that ye would enter paradise while yet allah knoweth not those of you who really strive nor knoweth those of you who are steadfast and verily ye used to wish for death before ye met it in the field now ye have seen it with your eyes muhammad is but messenger messengers the like of whom have passed away before him will it be that when he dieth or is slain ye will turn back on your heels he who turneth back on his heels doth no hurt to allah and allah will reward the thankful no soul can ever die except by allah leave and at term appointed whoso desireth the reward of the world we bestow on him thereof and whoso desireth the reward of the hereafter we bestow on him thereof we shall reward the thankful and with how many prophet have there been number of devoted men who fought beside him they quailed not for aught that befell them in the way of allah nor did they weaken nor were they brought low allah loveth the steadfast their cry was only that they said our lord forgive us for our sins and wasted efforts make our foothold sure and give us victory over the disbelieving folk so allah gave them the reward of the world and the good reward of the hereafter allah loveth those whose deeds are good ye who believe if ye obey those who disbelieve they will make you turn back on your heels and ye turn back as losers but allah is your protector and he is the best of helpers we shall cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve because they ascribe unto allah partners for which no warrant hath been revealed their habitation is the fire and hapless the abode of the wrong doers allah verily made good his promise unto you when ye routed them by his leave until the moment when your courage failed you and ye disagreed about the order and ye disobeyed after he had shown you that for which ye long some of you desired the world and some of you desired the hereafter therefore he made you flee from them that he might try you yet now he hath forgiven you allah is lord of kindness to believers when ye climbed the hill and paid no heed to anyone while the messenger in your rear was calling you to fight therefor he rewarded you grief for his grief that he might teach you not to sorrow either for that which ye missed or for that which befell you allah is informed of what ye do then after grief he sent down security for you as slumber did it overcome party of you while the other party who were anxious on their own account thought wrongly of allah the thought of ignorance they said have we any part in the cause say muhammad the cause belongeth wholly to allah they hide within themselves thought which they reveal not unto thee saying had we had any part in the cause we should not have been slain here say even though ye had been in your houses those appointed to be slain would have gone forth to the places where they were to lie all this hath been in order that allah might try what is in your breasts and prove what is in your hearts allah is aware of what is hidden in the breasts of men lo those of you who turned back on the day when the two hosts met satan alone it was who caused them to backslide because of some of that which they have earned now allah hath forgiven them lo allah is forgiving clement ye who believe be not as those who disbelieved and said of their brethren who went abroad in the land or were fighting in the field if they had been here with us they would not have died or been killed that allah may make it anguish in their hearts allah giveth life and causeth death and allah is seer of what ye do and what though ye be slain in allah way or die therein surely pardon from allah and mercy are better than all that they amass what though ye be slain or die when unto allah ye are gathered it was by the mercy of allah that thou wast lenient with them muhammad for if thou hadst been stern and fierce of heart they would have dispersed from round about thee so pardon them and ask forgiveness for them and consult with them upon the conduct of affairs and when thou art resolved then put thy trust in allah lo allah loveth those who put their trust in him if allah is your helper none can overcome you and if he withdraw his help from you who is there who can help you after him in allah let believers put their trust it is not for any prophet to embezzle whoso embezzleth will bring what he embezzled with him on the day of resurrection then every soul will be paid in full what it hath earned and they will not be wronged is one who followeth the pleasure of allah as one who hath earned condemnation from allah whose habitation is the fire hapless journey end there are degrees of grace and reprobation with allah and allah is seer of what they do allah verily hath shown grace to the believers by sending unto them messenger of their own who reciteth unto them his revelations and causeth them to grow and teacheth them the scripture and wisdom although before he came to them they were in flagrant error and was it so when disaster smote you though ye had smitten them with disaster twice as great that ye said how is this say unto them muhammad it is from yourselves lo allah is able to do all things that which befell you on the day when the two armies met was by permission of allah that he might know the true believers and that he might know the hypocrites unto whom it was said come fight in the way of allah or defend yourselves they answered if we knew aught of fighting we would follow you on that day they were nearer disbelief than faith they utter with their mouths thing which is not in their hearts allah is best aware of what they hide those who while they sat at home said of their brethren who were fighting for the cause of allah if they had been guided by us they would not have been slain say unto them muhammad then avert death from yourselves if ye are truthful think not of those who are slain in the way of allah as dead nay they are living with their lord they have provision jubilant are they because of that which allah hath bestowed upon them of his bounty rejoicing for the sake of those who have not joined them but are left behind that there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve they rejoice because of favour from allah and kindness and that allah wasteth not the wage of the believers as for those who heard the call of allah and his messenger after the harm befell them in the fight for such of them as do right and ward off evil there is great reward those unto whom men said lo the people have gathered against you therefor fear them the threat of danger but increased the faith of them and they cried allah is sufficient for us most excellent is he in whom we trust so they returned with grace and favour from allah and no harm touched them they followed the good pleasure of allah and allah is of infinite bounty it is only the devil who would make men fear his partisans fear them not fear me if ye are true believers let not their conduct grieve thee who run easily to disbelief for lo they injure allah not at all it is allah will to assign them no portion in the hereafter and theirs will be an awful doom those who purchase disbelief at the price of faith harm allah not at all but theirs will be painful doom and let not those who disbelieve imagine that the rein we give them bodeth good unto their souls we only give them rein that they may grow in sinfulness and theirs will be shameful doom it is not the purpose of allah to leave you in your present state till he shall separate the wicked from the good and it is not the purpose of allah to let you know the unseen but allah chooseth of his messengers whom he will to receive knowledge thereof so believe in allah and his messengers if ye believe and ward off evil yours will be vast reward and let not those who hoard up that which allah hath bestowed upon them of his bounty think that it is better for them nay it is worse for them that which they hoard will be their collar on the day of resurrection allah is the heritage of the heavens and the earth and allah is informed of what ye do verily allah heard the saying of those who said when asked for contributions to the war allah forsooth is poor and we are rich we shall record their saying with their slaying of the prophets wrongfully and we shall say taste ye the punishment of burning this is on account of that which your own hands have sent before you to the judgment allah is no oppressor of his bondmen the same are those who say lo allah hath charged in any messenger until he bring us an offering which fire devour say unto them muhammad messengers came unto miracles and with that very miracle which ye describe them answer that if ye are truthful us that we believe not from heaven shall you before me with why then did ye slay and if they deny thee even so did they deny messengers who were before thee who came with miracles and with the psalms and with the scripture giving light every soul will taste of death and ye will be paid on the day of resurrection only that which ye have fairly earned whoso is removed from the fire and is made to enter paradise he indeed is triumphant the life of this world is but comfort of illusion assuredly ye will be tried in your property and in your persons and ye will hear much wrong from those who were given the scripture before you and from the idolaters but if ye persevere and ward off evil then that is of the steadfast heart of things and remember when allah laid charge on those who had received the scripture he said ye are to expound it to mankind and not to hide it but they flung it behind their backs and bought thereby little gain verily evil is that which they have gained thereby think not that those who exult in what they have given and love to be praised for what they have not done think not they are in safety from the doom painful doom is theirs unto allah belongeth the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth allah is able to do all things lo in the creation of the heavens and the earth and in the difference of night and day are tokens of his sovereignty for men of understanding such as remember allah standing sitting and reclining and consider the creation of the heavens and the earth and say our lord thou createdst not this in vain glory be to thee preserve us from the doom of fire our lord whom thou causest to enter the fire him indeed thou hast confounded for evil doers there will be no helpers our lord lo we have heard crier calling unto faith believe ye in your lord so we believed our lord therefor forgive us our sins and remit from us our evil deeds and make us die the death of the righteous our lord and give us that which thou hast promised to us by thy messengers confound us not upon the day of resurrection lo thou breakest not the tryst and their lord hath heard them and he saith lo suffer not the work of any worker male or female to be lost ye proceed one from another so those who fled and were driven forth from their homes and suffered damage for my cause and fought and were slain verily shall remit their evil deeds from them and verily shall bring them into gardens underneath which rivers flow reward from allah and with allah is the fairest of rewards let not the vicissitude of the success of those who disbelieve in the land deceive thee muhammad it is but brief comfort and afterward their habitation will be hell an ill abode but those who keep their duty to their lord for them are gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will be safe for ever gift of welcome from their lord that which allah hath in store is better for the righteous and lo of the people of the scripture there are some who believe in allah and that which is revealed unto you and that which was revealed unto them humbling themselves before allah they purchase not trifling gain at the price of the revelations of allah verily their reward is with their lord lo allah is swift to take account ye who believe endure outdo all others in endurance be ready and observe your duty to allah in order that ye may succeed sura an nisa women mankind be careful of your duty to your lord who created you from single soul and from it created its mate and from them twain hath spread abroad multitude of men and women be careful of your duty toward allah in whom ye claim your rights of one another and toward the wombs that bare you lo allah hath been watcher over you give unto orphans their wealth exchange not the good for the bad in your management thereof nor absorb their wealth into your own wealth lo that would be great sin and if ye fear that ye will not deal fairly by the orphans marry of the women who seem good to you two or three or four and if ye fear that ye cannot do justice to so many then one only or the captives that your right hands possess thus it is more likely that ye will not do injustice and give unto the women whom ye marry free gift of their marriage portions but if they of their own accord remit unto you part thereof then ye are welcome to absorb it in your wealth give not unto the foolish what is in your keeping of their wealth which allah hath given you to maintain but feed and clothe them from it and speak kindly unto them prove orphans till they reach the marriageable age then if ye find them of sound judgment deliver over unto them their fortune and devour it not by squandering and in haste lest they should grow up whoso of the guardians is rich let him abstain generously from taking of the property of orphans and whoso is poor let him take thereof in reason for his guardianship and when ye deliver up their fortune unto orphans have the transaction witnessed in their presence allah sufficeth as reckoner unto the men of family belongeth share of that which parents and near kindred leave and unto the women share of that which parents and near kindred leave whether it be little or much legal share and when kinsfolk and orphans and the needy are present at the division of the heritage bestow on them therefrom and speak kindly unto them and let those fear in their behaviour toward orphans who if they left behind them weak offspring would be afraid for them so let them mind their duty to allah and speak justly lo those who devour the wealth of orphans wrongfully they do but swallow fire into their bellies and they will be exposed to burning flame allah chargeth you concerning the provision for your children to the male the equivalent of the portion of two females and if there be women more than two then theirs is two thirds of the inheritance and if there be one only then the half and to each of his parents sixth of the inheritance if he have son and if he have no son and his parents are his heirs then to his mother appertaineth the third and if he have brethren then to his mother appertaineth the sixth after any legacy he may have bequeathed or debt hath been paid your parents and your children ye know not which of them is nearer unto you in usefulness it is an injunction from allah lo allah is knower wise and unto you belongeth half of that which your wives leave if they have no child but if they have child then unto you the fourth of that which they leave after any legacy they may have bequeathed or debt they may have contracted hath been paid and unto them belongeth the fourth of that which ye leave if ye have no child but if ye have child then the eighth of that which ye leave after any legacy ye may have bequeathed or debt ye may have contracted hath been paid and if man or woman have distant heir having left neither parent nor child and he or she have brother or sister only on the mother side then to each of them twain the brother and the sister the sixth and if they be more than two then they shall be sharers in the third after any legacy that may have been bequeathed or debt contracted not injuring the heirs by willing away more than third of the heritage hath been paid commandment from allah allah is knower indulgent these are the limits imposed by allah whoso obeyeth allah and his messenger he will make him enter gardens underneath which rivers flow where such will dwell for ever that will be the great success and whoso disobeyeth allah and his messenger and transgresseth his limits he will make him enter fire where he will dwell for ever his will be shameful doom as for those of your women who are guilty of lewdness call to witness four of you against them and if they testify to the truth of the allegation then confine them to the houses until death take them or until allah appoint for them way through new legislation and as for the two of you who are guilty thereof punish them both and if they repent and improve then let them be lo allah is ever relenting merciful forgiveness is only incumbent on allah toward those who do evil in ignorance and then turn quickly in repentance to allah these are they toward whom allah relenteth allah is ever knower wise the forgiveness is not for those who do ill deeds until when death attendeth upon one of them he saith lo repent now nor yet for those who die while they are disbelievers for such we have prepared painful doom ye who believe it is not lawful for you forcibly to inherit the women of your deceased kinsmen nor that ye should put constraint upon them that ye may take away part of that which ye have given them unless they be guilty of flagrant lewdness but consort with them in kindness for if ye hate them it may happen that ye hate thing wherein allah hath placed much good and if ye wish to exchange one wife for another and ye have given unto one of them sum of money however great take nothing from it would ye take it by the way of calumny and open wrong how can ye take it back after one of you hath gone in unto the other and they have taken strong pledge from you and marry not those women whom your fathers married except what hath already happened of that nature in the past lo it was ever lewdness and abomination and an evil way forbidden unto you are your mothers and your daughters and your sisters and your father sisters and your mother sisters and your brother daughters and your sister daughters and your foster mothers and your foster sisters and your mothers in law and your step daughters who are under your protection born of your women unto whom ye have gone in but if ye have not gone in unto them then it is no sin for you to marry their daughters and the wives of your sons who spring from your own loins and it is forbidden unto you that ye should have two sisters together except what hath already happened of that nature in the past lo allah is ever forgiving merciful and all married women are forbidden unto you save those captives whom your right hands possess it is decree of allah for you lawful unto you are all beyond those mentioned so that ye seek them with your wealth in honest wedlock not debauchery and those of whom ye seek content by marrying them give unto them their portions as duty and there is no sin for you in what ye do by mutual agreement after the duty hath been done lo allah is ever knower wise and whoso is not able to afford to marry free believing women let them marry from the believing maids whom your right hands possess allah knoweth best concerning your faith ye proceed one from another so wed them by permission of their folk and give unto them their portions in kindness they being honest not debauched nor of loose conduct and if when they are honourably married they commit lewdness they shall incur the half of the punishment prescribed for free women in that case this is for him among you who feareth to commit sin but to have patience would be better for you allah is forgiving merciful allah would explain to you and guide you by the examples of those who were before you and would turn to you in mercy allah is knower wise and allah would turn to you in mercy but those who follow vain desires would have you go tremendously astray allah would make the burden light for you for man was created weak ye who believe squander not your wealth among yourselves in vanity except it be trade by mutual consent and kill not one another lo allah is ever merciful unto you whoso doeth that through aggression and injustice we shall cast him into fire and that is ever easy for allah if ye avoid the great things which ye are forbidden we will remit from you your evil deeds and make you enter at noble gate and covet not the thing in which allah hath made some of you excel others unto men fortune from that which they have earned and unto women fortune from that which they have earned envy not one another but ask allah of his bounty lo allah is ever knower of all things and unto each we have appointed heirs of that which parents and near kindred leave and as for those with whom your right hands have made covenant give them their due lo allah is ever witness over all things men are in charge of women because allah hath made the one of them to excel the other and because they spend of their property for the support of women so good women are the obedient guarding in secret that which allah hath guarded as for those from whom ye fear rebellion admonish them and banish them to beds apart and scourge them then if they obey you seek not way against them lo allah is ever high exalted great and if ye fear breach between them twain the man and wife appoint an arbiter from his folk and an arbiter from her folk if they desire amendment allah will make them of one mind lo allah is ever knower aware and serve allah ascribe no thing as partner unto him show kindness unto parents and unto near kindred and orphans and the needy and unto the neighbour who is of kin unto you and the neighbour who is not of kin and the fellow traveller and the wayfarer and the slaves whom your right hands possess lo allah loveth not such as are proud and boastful who hoard their wealth and enjoin avarice on others and hide that which allah hath bestowed upon them of his bounty for disbelievers we prepare shameful doom and also those who spend their wealth in order to be seen of men and believe not in allah nor the last day whoso taketh satan for comrade bad comrade hath he what have they to fear if they believe in allah and the last day and spend aright of that which allah hath bestowed upon them when allah is ever aware of them and all they do lo allah wrongeth not even of the weight of an ant and if there is good deed he will double it and will give the doer from his presence an immense reward but how will it be with them when we bring of every people witness and we bring thee muhammad witness against these on that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the messenger will wish that they were level with the ground and they can hide no fact from allah ye who believe draw not near unto prayer when ye are drunken till ye know that which ye utter nor when ye are polluted save when journeying upon the road till ye have bathed and if ye be ill or on journey or one of you cometh from the closet or ye have touched women and ye find not water then go to high clean soil and rub your faces and your hands therewith lo allah is benign forgiving seest thou not those unto whom portion of the scripture hath been given how they purchase error and seek to make you muslims err from the right way allah knoweth best who are your enemies allah is sufficient as guardian and allah is sufficient as supporter some of those who are jews change words from their context and say we hear and disobey hear thou as one who heareth not and listen to us distorting with their tongues and slandering religion if they had said we hear and we obey hear thou and look at us it had been better for them and more upright but allah hath cursed them for their disbelief so they believe not save few ye unto whom the scripture hath been given believe in what we have revealed confirming that which ye possess before we destroy countenances so as to confound them or curse them as we cursed the sabbath breakers of old time the commandment of allah is always executed lo allah forgiveth not that partner should be ascribed unto him he forgiveth all save that to whom he will whoso ascribeth partners to allah he hath indeed invented tremendous sin hast thou not seen those who praise themselves for purity nay allah purifieth whom he will and they will not be wronged even the hair upon datestone see how they invent lies about allah that of itself is flagrant sin hast thou not seen those unto whom portion of the scripture hath been given how they believe in idols and false deities and how they say of those idolaters who disbelieve these are more rightly guided than those who believe those are they whom allah hath cursed and he whom allah hath cursed thou muhammad wilt find for him no helper or have they even share in the sovereignty then in that case they would not give mankind even the speck on date stone or are they jealous of mankind because of that which allah of his bounty hath bestowed upon them for we bestowed upon the house of abraham of old the scripture and wisdom and we bestowed on them mighty kingdom and of them were some who believed therein and of them were some who turned away from it hell is sufficient for their burning lo those who disbelieve our revelations we shall expose them to the fire as often as their skins are consumed we shall exchange them for fresh skins that they may taste the torment lo allah is ever mighty wise and as for those who believe and do good works we shall make them enter gardens underneath which rivers flow to dwell therein for ever there for them are pure companions and we shall make them enter plenteous shade lo allah commandeth you that ye restore deposits to their owners and if ye judge between mankind that ye judge justly lo comely is this which allah admonisheth you lo allah is ever hearer seer ye who believe obey allah and obey the messenger and those of you who are in authority and if ye have dispute concerning any matter refer it to allah and the messenger if ye are in truth believers in allah and the last day that is better and more seemly in the end hast thou not seen those who pretend that they believe in that which is revealed unto thee and that which was revealed before thee how they would go for judgment in their disputes to false deities when they have been ordered to abjure them satan would mislead them far astray and when it is said unto them come unto that which allah hath revealed and unto the messenger thou seest the hypocrites turn from thee with aversion how would it be if misfortune smote them because of that which their own hands have sent before them then would they come unto thee swearing by allah that they were seeking naught but harmony and kindness those are they the secrets of whose hearts allah knoweth so oppose them and admonish them and address them in plain terms about their souls we sent no messenger save that he should be obeyed by allah leave and if when they had wronged themselves they had but come unto thee and asked forgiveness of allah and asked forgiveness of the messenger they would have found allah forgiving merciful but nay by thy lord they will not believe in truth until they make thee judge of what is in dispute between them and find within themselves no dislike of that which thou decidest and submit with full submission and if we had decreed for them lay down your lives or go forth from your dwellings but few of them would have done it though if they did what they are exhorted to do it would be better for them and more strengthening and then we should bestow upon them from our presence an immense reward and should guide them unto straight path whoso obeyeth allah and the messenger they are with those unto whom allah hath shown favour of the prophets and the saints and the martyrs and the righteous the best of company are they that is bounty from allah and allah sufficeth as knower ye who believe take your precautions then advance the proven ones or advance all together lo among you there is he who loitereth and if disaster overtook you he would say allah hath been gracious unto me since was not present with them and if bounty from allah befell you he would surely cry as if there had been no love between you and him oh would that had been with them then should have achieved great success let those fight in the way of allah who sell the life of this world for the other whoso fighteth in the way of allah be he slain or be he victorious on him we shall bestow vast reward how should ye not fight for the cause of allah and of the feeble among men and of the women and the children who are crying our lord bring us forth from out this town of which the people are oppressors oh give us from thy presence some protecting friend oh give us from thy presence some defender those who believe do battle for the cause of allah and those who disbelieve do battle for the cause of idols so fight the minions of the devil lo the devil strategy is ever weak hast thou not seen those unto whom it was said withhold your hands establish worship and pay the poordue but when fighting was prescribed for them behold party of them fear mankind even as their fear of allah or with greater fear and say our lord why hast thou ordained fighting for us if only thou wouldst give us respite yet while say unto them muhammad the comfort of this world is scant the hereafter will be better for him who wardeth off evil and ye will not be wronged the down upon date stone wheresoever ye may be death will overtake you even though ye were in lofty towers yet if happy thing befalleth them they say this is from allah and if an evil thing befalleth them they say this is of thy doing muhammad say unto them all is from allah what is amiss with these people that they come not nigh to understand happening whatever of good befalleth thee man it is from allah and whatever of ill befalleth thee it is from thyself we have sent thee muhammad as messenger unto mankind and allah is sufficient as witness whoso obeyeth the messenger hath obeyed allah and whoso turneth away we have not sent thee as warder over them and they say it is obedience but when they have gone forth from thee party of them spend the night in planning other than what thou sayest allah recordeth what they plan by night so oppose them and put thy trust in allah allah is sufficient as trustee will they not then ponder on the qur an if it had been from other than allah they would have found therein much incongruity and if any tidings whether of safety or fear come unto them they noise it abroad whereas if they had referred it to the messenger and to such of them as are in authority those among them who are able to think out the matter would have known it if it had not been for the grace of allah upon you and his mercy ye would have followed satan save few of you so fight muhammad in the way of allah thou art not taxed with the responsibility for anyone except thyself and urge on the believers peradventure allah will restrain the might of those who disbelieve allah is stronger in might and stronger in inflicting punishment whoso interveneth in good cause will have the reward thereof and whoso interveneth in an evil cause will bear the consequence thereof allah overseeth all things when ye are greeted with greeting greet ye with better than it or return it lo allah taketh count of all things allah there is no allah save him he gathereth you all unto day of resurrection whereof there is no doubt who is more true in statement than allah what aileth you that ye are become two parties regarding the hypocrites when allah cast them back to disbelief because of what they earned seek ye to guide him whom allah hath sent astray he whom allah sendeth astray for him thou muhammad canst not find road they long that ye should disbelieve even as they disbelieve that ye may be upon level with them so choose not friends from them till they forsake their homes in the way of allah if they turn back to enmity then take them and kill them wherever ye find them and choose no friend nor helper from among them except those who seek refuge with people between whom and you there is covenant or those who come unto you because their hearts forbid them to make war on you or make war on their own folk had allah willed he could have given them power over you so that assuredly they would have fought you so if they hold aloof from you and wage not war against you and offer you peace allah alloweth you no way against them ye will find others who desire that they should have security from you and security from their own folk so often as they are returned to hostility they are plunged therein if they keep not aloof from you nor offer you peace nor hold their hands then take them and kill them wherever ye find them against such we have given you clear warrant it is not for believer to kill believer unless it be by mistake he who hath killed believer by mistake must set free believing slave and pay the blood money to the family of the slain unless they remit it as charity if he the victim be of people hostile unto you and he is believer then the penance is to set free believing slave and if he cometh of folk between whom and you there is covenant then the blood money must be paid unto his folk and also believing slave must be set free and whoso hath not the wherewithal must fast two consecutive months penance from allah allah is knower wise whoso slayeth believer of set purpose his reward is hell for ever allah is wroth against him and he hath cursed him and prepared for him an awful doom ye who believe when ye go forth to fight in the way of allah be careful to discriminate and say not unto one who offereth you peace thou art not believer seeking the chance profits of this life so that ye may despoil him with allah are plenteous spoils even thus as he now is were ye before but allah hath since then been gracious unto you therefore take care to discriminate allah is ever informed of what ye do those of the believers who sit still other than those who have disabling hurt are not on an equality with those who strive in the way of allah with their wealth and lives allah hath conferred on those who strive with their wealth and lives rank above the sedentary unto each allah hath promised good but he hath bestowed on those who strive great reward above the sedentary degrees of rank from him and forgiveness and mercy allah is ever forgiving merciful lo as for those whom the angels take in death while they wrong themselves the angels will ask in what were ye engaged they will say we were oppressed in the land the angels will say was not allah earth spacious that ye could have migrated therein as for such their habitation will be hell an evil journey end except the feeble among men and the women and the children who are unable to devise plan and are not shown way as for such it may be that allah will pardon them allah is ever clement forgiving whoso migrateth for the cause of allah will find much refuge and abundance in the earth and whoso forsaketh his home fugitive unto allah and his messenger and death overtaketh him his reward is then incumbent on allah allah is ever forgiving merciful and when ye go forth in the land it is no sin for you to curtail your worship if ye fear that those who disbelieve may attack you in truth the disbelievers are an open enemy to you and when thou muhammad art among them and arrangest their worship for them let only party of them stand with thee to worship and let them take their arms then when they have performed their prostrations let them fall to the rear and let another party come that hath not worshipped and let them worship with thee and let them take their precaution and their arms those who disbelieve long for you to neglect your arms and your baggage that they may attack you once for all it is no sin for you to lay aside your arms if rain impedeth you or ye are sick but take your precaution lo allah prepareth for the disbelievers shameful punishment when ye have performed the act of worship remember allah standing sitting and reclining and when ye are in safety observe proper worship worship at fixed times hath been enjoined on the believers relent not in pursuit of the enemy if ye are suffering lo they suffer even as ye suffer and ye hope from allah that for which they cannot hope allah is ever knower wise lo we reveal unto thee the scripture with the truth that thou mayst judge between mankind by that which allah showeth thee and be not thou pleader for the treacherous and seek forgiveness of allah lo allah is ever forgiving merciful and plead not on behalf of people who deceive themselves lo allah loveth not one who is treacherous and sinful they seek to hide from men and seek not to hide from allah he is with them when by night they hold discourse displeasing unto him allah ever surroundeth what they do ho ye are they who pleaded for them in the life of the world but who will plead with allah for them on the day of resurrection or who will then be their defender yet whoso doeth evil or wrongeth his own soul then seeketh pardon of allah will find allah forgiving merciful whoso committeth sin committeth it only against himself allah is ever knower wise and whoso committeth delinquency or crime then throweth the blame thereof upon the innocent hath burdened himself with falsehood and flagrant crime but for the grace of allah upon thee muhammad and his mercy party of them had resolved to mislead thee but they will mislead only themselves and they will hurt thee not at all allah revealeth unto thee the scripture and wisdom and teacheth thee that which thou knewest not the grace of allah toward thee hath been infinite there is no good in much of their secret conferences save in him who enjoineth almsgiving and kindness and peace making among the people whoso doeth that seeking the good pleasure of allah we shall bestow on him vast reward and whoso opposeth the messenger after the guidance of allah hath been manifested unto him and followeth other than the believer way we appoint for him that unto which he himself hath turned and expose him unto hell hapless journey end lo allah pardoneth not that partners should be ascribed unto him he pardoneth all save that to whom he will whoso ascribeth partners unto allah hath wandered far astray they invoke in his stead only females they pray to none else than satan rebel whom allah cursed and he said surely will take of thy bondmen an appointed portion and surely will lead them astray and surely will arouse desires in them and surely will command them and they will cut the cattle ears and surely will command them and they will change allah creation whoso chooseth satan for patron instead of allah is verily loser and his loss is manifest he promiseth them and stirreth up desires in them and satan promiseth them only to beguile for such their habitation will be hell and they will find no refuge therefrom but as for those who believe and do good works we shall bring them into gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide for ever it is promise from allah in truth and who can be more truthful than allah in utterance it will not be in accordance with your desires nor the desires of the people of the scripture he who doeth wrong will have the recompense thereof and will not find against allah any protecting friend or helper and whoso doeth good works whether of male or female and he or she is believer such will enter paradise and they will not be wronged the dint in date stone who is better in religion than he who surrendereth his purpose to allah while doing good to men and followeth the tradition of abraham the upright allah himself chose abraham for friend unto allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth allah ever surroundeth all things they consult thee concerning women say allah giveth you decree concerning them and the scripture which hath been recited unto you giveth decree concerning female orphans and those unto whom ye give not that which is ordained for them though ye desire to marry them and concerning the weak among children and that ye should deal justly with orphans whatever good ye do lo allah is ever aware of it if woman feareth ill treatment from her husband or desertion it is no sin for them twain if they make terms of peace between themselves peace is better but greed hath been made present in the minds of men if ye do good and keep from evil lo allah is ever informed of what ye do ye will not be able to deal equally between your wives however much ye wish to do so but turn not altogether away from one leaving her as in suspense if ye do good and keep from evil lo allah is ever forgiving merciful but if they separate allah will compensate each out of his abundance allah is ever all embracing all knowing unto allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth and we charged those who received the scripture before you and we charge you that ye keep your duty toward allah and if ye disbelieve lo unto allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth and allah is ever absolute owner of praise unto allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth and allah is sufficient as defender if he will he can remove you people and produce others in your stead allah is able to do that whoso desireth the reward of the world let him know that with allah is the reward of the world and the hereafter allah is ever hearer seer ye who believe be ye staunch in justice witnesses for allah even though it be against yourselves or your parents or your kindred whether the case be of rich man or poor man for allah is nearer unto both them ye are so follow not passion lest ye lapse from truth and if ye lapse or fall away then lo allah is ever informed of what ye do ye who believe believe in allah and his messenger and the scripture which he hath revealed unto his messenger and the scripture which he revealed aforetime whoso disbelieveth in allah and his angels and his scriptures and his messengers and the last day he verily hath wandered far astray lo those who believe then disbelieve and then again believe then disbelieve and then increase in disbelief allah will never pardon them nor will he guide them unto way bear unto the hypocrites the tidings that for them there is painful doom those who chose disbelievers for their friends instead of believers do they look for power at their hands lo all power appertaineth to allah he hath already revealed unto you in the scripture that when ye hear the revelations of allah rejected and derided ye sit not with them who disbelieve and mock until they engage in some other conversation lo in that case if ye stayed ye would be like unto them lo allah will gather hypocrites and disbelievers all together into hell those who wait upon occasion in regard to you and if victory cometh unto you from allah say are we not with you and if the disbelievers meet with success say had we not the mastery of you and did we not protect you from the believers allah will judge between you at the day of resurrection and allah will not give the disbelievers any way of success against the believers lo the hypocrites seek to beguile allah but it is he who beguileth them when they stand up to worship they perform it languidly and to be seen of men and are mindful of allah but little swaying between this and that belonging neither to these nor to those he whom allah causeth to go astray thou muhammad wilt not find way for him ye who believe choose not disbelievers for your friends in place of believers would ye give allah clear warrant against you lo the hypocrites will be in the lowest deep of the fire and thou wilt find no helper for them save those who repent and amend and hold fast to allah and make their religion pure for allah only those are with the believers and allah will bestow on the believers an immense reward what concern hath allah for your punishment if ye are thankful for his mercies and believe in him allah was ever responsive aware allah loveth not the utterance of harsh speech save by one who hath been wronged allah is ever hearer knower if ye do good openly or keep it secret or forgive evil lo allah is ever forgiving powerful lo those who disbelieve in allah and his messengers and seek to make distinction between allah and his messengers and say we believe in some and disbelieve in others and seek to choose way in between such are disbelievers in truth and for disbelievers we prepare shameful doom but those who believe in allah and his messengers and make no distinction between any of them unto them allah will give their wages and allah was ever forgiving merciful the people of the scripture ask of thee that thou shouldst cause an actual book to descend upon them from heaven they asked greater thing of moses aforetime for they said show us allah plainly the storm of lightning seized them for their wickedness then even after that they chose the calf for worship after clear proofs of allah sovereignty had come unto them and we forgave them that and we bestowed on moses evident authority and we caused the mount to tower above them at the taking of their covenant and we bade them enter the gate prostrate and we bode them transgress not the sabbath and we took from them firm covenant then because of their breaking of their covenant and their disbelieving in the revelations of allah and their slaying of the prophets wrongfully and their saying our hearts are hardened nay but allah set seal upon them for their disbelief so that they believe not save few and because of their disbelief and of their speaking against mary tremendous calumny and because of their saying we slew the messiah jesus son of mary allah messenger they slew him not nor crucified him but it appeared so unto them and lo those who disagree concerning it are in doubt thereof they have no knowledge thereof save pursuit of conjecture they slew him not for certain but allah took him up unto himself allah was ever mighty wise there is not one of the people of the scripture but will believe in him before his death and on the day of resurrection he will be witness against them because of the wrongdoing of the jews we forbade them good things which were before made lawful unto them and because of their much hindering from allah way and of their taking usury when they were forbidden it and of their devouring people wealth by false pretences we have prepared for those of them who disbelieve painful doom but those of them who are firm in knowledge and the believers believe in that which is revealed unto thee and that which was revealed before thee especially the diligent in prayer and those who pay the poor due the believers in allah and the last day upon these we shall bestow immense reward lo we inspire thee as we inspired noah and the prophets after him as we inspired abraham and ishmael and isaac and jacob and the tribes and jesus and job and jonah and aaron and solomon and as we imparted unto david the psalms and messengers we have mentioned unto thee before and messengers we have not mentioned unto thee and allah spake directly unto moses messengers of good cheer and of warning in order that mankind might have no argument against allah after the messengers allah was ever mighty wise but allah himself testifieth concerning that which he hath revealeth unto thee in his knowledge hath he revealed it and the angels also testify and allah is sufficient witness lo those who disbelieve and hinder others from the way of allah they verily have wandered far astray lo those who disbelieve and deal in wrong allah will never forgive them neither will he guide them unto road except the road of hell wherein they will abide for ever and that is ever easy for allah mankind the messenger hath come unto you with the truth from your lord therefor believe it is better for you but if ye disbelieve still lo unto allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth allah is ever knower wise people of the scripture do not exaggerate in your religion nor utter aught concerning allah save the truth the messiah jesus son of mary was only messenger of allah and his word which he conveyed unto mary and spirit from him so believe in allah and his messengers and say not three cease it is better for you allah is only one allah far is it removed from his transcendent majesty that he should have son his is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth and allah is sufficient as defender the messiah will never scorn to be slave unto allah nor will the favoured angels whoso scorneth his service and is proud all such will he assemble unto him then as for those who believed and did their wages in full adding unto them of his scornful and proud them will he punish with find for them against allah any protecting good works unto them will he pay bounty and as for those who were painful doom and they will not friend or helper mankind now hath proof from your lord come unto you and we have sent down unto you clear light as for those who believe in allah and hold fast unto him them he will cause to enter into his mercy and grace and will guide them unto him by straight road they ask thee for pronouncement say allah hath pronounced for you concerning distant kindred if man die childless and he have sister hers is half the heritage and he would have inherited from her had she died childless and if there be two sisters then theirs are two thirds of the heritage and if they be brethren men and women unto the male is the equivalent of the share of two females allah expoundeth unto you so that ye err not allah is knower of all things sura al maeda the table the table spread ye who believe fulfil your indentures the beast of cattle is made lawful unto you for food except that which is announced unto you herein game being unlawful when ye are on the pilgrimage lo allah ordaineth that which pleaseth him ye who believe profane not allah monuments nor the sacred month nor the offerings nor the garlands nor those repairing to the sacred house seeking the grace and pleasure of their lord but when ye have left the sacred territory then go hunting if ye will and let not your hatred of folk who once stopped your going to the inviolable place of worship seduce you to transgress but help ye one another unto righteousness and pious duty help not one another unto sin and transgression but keep your duty to allah lo allah is severe in punishment forbidden unto you for food are carrion and blood and swineflesh and that which hath been dedicated unto any other than allah and the strangled and the dead through beating and the dead through falling from height and that which hath been killed by the goring of horns and the devoured of wild beasts saving that which ye make lawful by the death stroke and that which hath been immolated unto idols and forbidden is it that ye swear by the divining arrows this is an abomination this day are those who disbelieve in despair of ever harming your religion so fear them not fear me this day have perfected your religion for you and completed my favour unto you and have chosen for you as religion al islam whoso is forced by hunger not by will to sin for him lo allah is forgiving merciful they ask thee muhammad what is made lawful for them say all good things are made lawful for you and those beasts and birds of prey which ye have trained as hounds are trained ye teach them that which allah taught you so eat of that which they catch for you and mention allah name upon it and observe your duty to allah lo allah is swift to take account this day are all good things made lawful for you the food of those who have received the scripture is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them and so are the virtuous women of the believers and the virtuous women of those who received the scripture before you lawful for you when ye give them their marriage portions and live with them in honour not in fornication nor taking them as secret concubines whoso denieth the faith his work is vain and he will be among the losers in the hereafter ye who believe when ye rise up for prayer wash you faces and your hands up to the elbows and lightly rub your heads and wash your feet up to the ankles and if ye are unclean purify yourselves and if ye are sick or on journey or one of you cometh from the closet or ye have had contact with women and ye find not water then go to clean high ground and rub your faces and your hands with some of it allah would not place burden on you but he would purify you and would perfect his grace upon you that ye may give thanks remember allah grace upon you and his covenant by which he bound you when ye said we hear and we obey and keep your duty to allah lo he knoweth what is in the breasts of men ye who believe be steadfast witnesses for allah in equity and let not hatred of any people seduce you that ye deal not justly deal justly that is nearer to your duty observe your duty to allah lo allah is informed of what ye do allah hath promised those who believe and do good works theirs will be forgiveness and immense reward and they who disbelieve and deny our revelations such are rightful owners of hell ye who believe remember allah favour unto you how people were minded to stretch out their hands against you but he withheld their hands from you and keep your duty to allah in allah let believers put their trust allah made covenant of old with the children of israel and we raised among them twelve chieftains and allah said lo am with you if ye establish worship and pay the poor due and believe in my messengers and support them and lend unto allah kindly loan surely shall remit your sins and surely shall bring you into gardens underneath which rivers flow whoso among you disbelieveth after this will go astray from plain road and because of their breaking their covenant we have cursed them and made hard their hearts they change words from their context and forget part of that whereof they were admonished thou wilt not cease to discover treachery from all save few of them but bear with them and pardon them lo allah loveth the kindly and with those who say lo we are christians we made covenant but they forgot part of that whereof they were admonished therefor we have stirred up enmity and hatred among them till the day of resurrection when allah will inform them of their handiwork people of the scripture now hath our messenger come unto you expounding unto you much of that which ye used to hide in the scripture and forgiving much now hath come unto you light from allah and plain scripture whereby allah guideth him who seeketh his good pleasure unto paths of peace he bringeth them out of darkness unto light by his decree and guideth them unto straight path they indeed have disbelieved who say lo allah is the messiah son of mary say who then can do aught against allah if he had willed to destroy the messiah son of mary and his mother and everyone on earth allah is the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them he createth what he will and allah is able to do all things the jews and christians say we are sons of allah and his loved ones say why then doth he chastise you for your sins nay ye are but mortals of his creating he forgiveth whom he will and chastiseth whom he will allah is the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them and unto him is the journeying people of the scripture now hath our messenger come unto you to make things plain unto you after an interval of cessation of the messengers lest ye should say there came not unto us messenger of cheer nor any warner now hath messenger of cheer and warner come unto you allah is able to do all things and remember when moses said unto his people my people remember allah favour unto you how he placed among you prophets and he made you kings and gave you that which he gave not to any other of his creatures my people go into the holy land which allah hath ordained for you turn not in flight for surely ye turn back as losers they said moses lo giant people dwell therein and lo we go not in till they go forth from thence when they go forth from thence then we will enter not till then then out spake two of those who feared their lord men unto whom allah had been gracious enter in upon them by the gate for if ye enter by it lo ye will be victorious so put your trust in allah if ye are indeed believers they said moses we will never enter the land while they are in it so go thou and thy lord and fight we will sit here he said my lord have control of none but myself and my brother so distinguish between us and the wrong doing folk their lord said for this the land will surely be forbidden them for forty years that they will wander in the earth bewildered so grieve not over the wrongdoing folk but recite unto them with truth the tale of the two sons of adam how they offered each sacrifice and it was accepted from the one of them and it was not accepted from the other the one said will surely kill thee the other answered allah accepteth only from those who ward off evil even if thou stretch out thy hand against me to kill me shall not stretch out my hand against thee to kill thee lo fear allah the lord of the worlds lo would rather thou shouldst bear the punishment of the sin against me and thine own sin and become one of the owners of the fire that is the reward of evil doers but the other mind imposed on him the killing of his brother so he slew him and became one of the losers then allah sent raven scratching up the ground to show him how to hide his brother naked corpse he said woe unto me am not able to be as this raven and so hide my brother naked corpse and he became repentant for that cause we decreed for the children of israel that whosoever killeth human being for other than manslaughter or corruption in the earth it shall be as if he had killed all mankind and whoso saveth the life of one it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind our messengers came unto them of old with clear proofs of allah sovereignty but afterwards lo many of them became prodigals in the earth the only reward of those who make war upon allah and his messenger and strive after corruption in the land will be that they will be killed or crucified or have their hands and feet on alternate sides cut off or will be expelled out of the land such will be their degradation in the world and in the hereafter theirs will be an awful doom save those who repent before ye overpower them for know that allah is forgiving merciful ye who believe be mindful of your duty to allah and seek the way of approach unto him and strive in his way in order that ye may succeed as for those who disbelieve lo if all that is in the earth were theirs and as much again therewith to ransom them from the doom on the day of resurrection it would not be accepted from them theirs will be painful doom they will wish to come forth from the fire but they will not come forth from it theirs will be lasting doom as for the thief both male and female cut off their hands it is the reward of their own deeds an exemplary punishment from allah allah is mighty wise but whoso repenteth after his wrongdoing and amendeth lo allah will relent toward him lo allah is forgiving merciful knowest thou not that unto allah belongeth the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth he punisheth whom he will and forgiveth whom he will allah is able to do all things messenger let not them grieve thee who vie one with another in the race to disbelief of such as say with their mouths we believe but their hearts believe not and of the jews listeners for the sake of falsehood listeners on behalf of other folk who come not unto thee changing words from their context and saying if this be given unto you receive it but if this be not given unto you then beware he whom allah doometh unto sin thou by thine efforts wilt avail him naught against allah those are they for whom the will of allah is that he cleanse not their hearts theirs in the world will be ignominy and in the hereafter an awful doom listeners for the sake of falsehood greedy for illicit gain if then they have recourse unto thee muhammad judge between them or disclaim jurisdiction if thou disclaimest jurisdiction then they cannot harm thee at all but if thou judgest judge between them with equity lo allah loveth the equitable how come they unto thee for judgment when they have the torah wherein allah hath delivered judgment for them yet even after that they turn away such folk are not believers lo we did reveal the torah wherein is guidance and light by which the prophets who surrendered unto allah judged the jews and the rabbis and the priests judged by such of allah scripture as they were bidden to observe and thereunto were they witnesses so fear not mankind but fear me and my revelations for little gain whoso judgeth not by that which allah hath revealed such are disbelievers and we prescribed for them therein the life for the life and the eye for the eye and the nose for the nose and the ear for the ear and the tooth for the tooth and for wounds retaliation but whoso forgoeth it in the way of charity it shall be expiation for him whoso judgeth not by that which allah hath revealed such are wrong doers and we caused jesus son of mary to follow in their footsteps confirming that which was revealed before him in the torah and we bestowed on him the gospel wherein is guidance and light confirming that which was revealed before it in the torah guidance and an admonition unto those who ward off evil let the people of the gospel judge by that which allah hath revealed therein whoso judgeth not by that which allah hath revealed such are evillivers and unto thee have we revealed the scripture with the truth confirming whatever scripture was before it and watcher over it so judge between them by that which allah hath revealed and follow not their desires away from the truth which hath come unto thee for each we have appointed divine law and traced out way had allah willed he could have made you one community but that he may try you by that which he hath given you he hath made you as ye are so vie one with another in good works unto allah ye will all return and he will then inform you of that wherein ye differ so judge between them by that which allah hath revealed and follow not their desires but beware of them lest they seduce thee from some part of that which allah hath revealed unto thee and if they turn away then know that allah will is to smite them for some sin of theirs lo many of mankind are evil livers is it judgment of the time of pagan ignorance that they are seeking who is better than allah for judgment to people who have certainty in their belief ye who believe take not the jews and the christians for friends they are friends one to another he among you who taketh them for friends is one of them lo allah guideth not wrongdoing folk and thou seest those in whose heart is disease race toward them saying we fear lest change of fortune befall us and it may happen that allah will vouchsafe unto thee the victory or commandment from his presence then will they repent them of their secret thoughts then will the believers say unto the people of the scripture are these they who swore by allah their most binding oaths that they were surely with you their works have failed and they have become the losers ye who believe whoso of you becometh renegade from his religion know that in his stead allah will bring people whom he loveth and who love him humble toward believers stern toward disbelievers striving in the way of allah and fearing not the blame of any blamer such is the grace of allah which he giveth unto whom he will allah is all embracing all knowing your guardian can be only allah and his messenger and those who believe who establish worship and pay the poordue and bow down in prayer and whoso taketh allah and his messenger and those who believe for guardian will know that lo the party of allah they are the victorious ye who believe choose not for guardians such of those who received the scripture before you and of the disbelievers as make jest and sport of your religion but keep your duty to allah if ye are true believers and when ye call to prayer they take it for jest and sport that is because they are folk who understand not say people of the scripture do ye blame us for aught else than that we believe in allah and that which is revealed unto us and that which was revealed aforetime and because most of you are evil livers shall tell thee of worse case than theirs for retribution with allah worse is the case of him whom allah hath cursed him on whom his wrath hath fallen and of whose sort allah hath turned some to apes and swine and who serveth idols such are in worse plight and further astray from the plain road when they come unto you muslims they say we believe but they came in unbelief and they went out in the same and allah knoweth best what they were hiding and thou seest many of them vying one with another in sin and transgression and their devouring of illicit gain verily evil is what they do why do not the rabbis and the priests forbid their evil speaking and their devouring of illicit gain verily evil is their handiwork the jews say allah hand is fettered their hands are fettered and they are accursed for saying so nay but both his hands are spread out wide in bounty he bestoweth as he will that which hath been revealed unto thee from thy lord is certain to increase the contumacy and disbelief of many of them and we have cast among them enmity and hatred till the day of resurrection as often as they light fire for war allah extinguisheth it their effort is for corruption in the land and allah loveth not corrupters if only the people of the scripture would believe and ward off evil surely we should remit their sins from them and surely we should bring them into gardens of delight if they had observed the torah and the gospel and that which was revealed unto them from their lord they would surely have been nourished from above them and from beneath their feet among them there are people who are moderate but many of them are of evil conduct messenger make known that which hath been revealed unto thee from thy lord for if thou do it not thou wilt not have conveyed his message allah will protect thee from mankind lo allah guideth not the disbelieving folk say people of the scripture ye have naught of guidance till ye observe the torah and the gospel and that which was revealed unto you from your lord that which is revealed unto thee muhammad from thy lord is certain to increase the contumacy and disbelief of many of them but grieve not for the disbelieving folk lo those who believe and those who are jews and sabaeans and christians whosoever believeth in allah and the last day and doeth right there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve we made covenant of old with the children of israel and we sent unto them messengers as often as messenger came unto them with that which their souls desired not they became rebellious some of them they denied and some they slew they thought no harm would come of it so they were wilfully blind and deaf and afterward allah turned in mercy toward them now even after that are many of them wilfully blind and deaf allah is seer of what they do they surely disbelieve who say lo allah is the messiah son of mary the messiah himself said children of israel worship allah my lord and your lord lo whoso ascribeth partners unto allah for him allah hath forbidden paradise his abode is the fire for evil doers there will be no helpers they surely disbelieve who say lo allah is the third of three when there is no allah save the one allah if they desist not from so saying painful doom will fall on those of them who disbelieve will they not rather turn unto allah and seek forgiveness of him for allah is forgiving merciful the messiah son of mary was no other than messenger messengers the like of whom had passed away before him and his mother was saintly woman and they both used to eat earthly food see how we make the revelations clear for them and see how they are turned away say serve ye in place of allah that which possesseth for you neither hurt nor use allah it is who is the hearer the knower say people of the scripture stress not in your religion other than the truth and follow not the vain desires of folk who erred of old and led many astray and erred from plain road those of the children of israel who went astray were cursed by the tongue of david and of jesus son of mary that was because they rebelled and used to transgress they restrained not one another from the wickedness they did verily evil was that they used to do thou seest many of them making friends with those who disbelieve surely ill for them is that which they themselves send on before them that allah will be wroth with them and in the doom they will abide if they believed in allah and the prophet and that which is revealed unto him they would not choose them for their friends but many of them are of evil conduct thou wilt find the most vehement of mankind in hostility to those who believe to be the jews and the idolaters and thou wilt find the nearest of them in affection to those who believe to be those who say lo we are christians that is because there are among them priests and monks and because they are not proud when they listen to that which hath been revealed unto the messengers thou seest their eyes overflow with tears because of their recognition of the truth they say our lord we believe inscribe us as among the witnesses how should we not believe in allah and that which hath come unto us of the truth and how should we not hope that our lord will bring us in along with righteous folk allah hath rewarded them for that their saying gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide for ever that is the reward of the good but those who disbelieve and deny our revelations they are owners of hellfire ye who believe forbid not the good things which allah hath made lawful for you and transgress not lo allah loveth not transgressors eat of that which allah hath bestowed on you as food lawful and good and keep your duty to allah in whom ye are believers allah will not take you to task oaths but he will take you to task expiation thereof is the feeding of wherewith ye feed your own folk or for for ten the that which is unintentional in your the oaths which ye swear in earnest the of the needy with the average of that clothing of them or the liberation of slave and for him who findeth not the wherewithal to do so then three days fast this is the expiation of your oaths when ye have sworn and keep your oaths thus allah expoundeth unto you his revelations in order that ye may give thanks ye who believe strong drink and games of chance and idols and divining arrows are only an infamy of satan handiwork leave it aside in order that ye may succeed satan seeketh only to cast among you enmity and hatred by means of strong drink and games of chance and to turn you from remembrance of allah and from his worship will ye then have done obey allah and obey the messenger and beware but if ye turn away then know that the duty of our messenger is only plain conveyance of the message there shall be no sin imputed unto those who believe and do good works for what they may have eaten in the past so be mindful of your duty to allah and believe and do good works and again be mindful of your duty and believe and once again be mindful of your duty and do right allah loveth the good ye who believe allah will surely try you somewhat in the matter of the game which ye take with your hands and your spears that allah may know him who feareth him in secret whoso transgresseth after this for him there is painful doom ye who believe kill no wild game while ye are on the pilgrimage whoso of you killeth it of set purpose he shall pay its forfeit in the equivalent of that which he hath killed of domestic animals the judge to be two men among you known for justice the forfeit to be brought as an offering to the ka bah or for expiation he shall feed poor persons or the equivalent thereof in fasting that he may taste the evil consequences of his deed allah forgiveth whatever of this kind may have happened in the past but whoso relapseth allah will take retribution from him allah is mighty able to requite the wrong to hunt and to eat the fish of the sea is made lawful for you provision for you and for seafarers but to hunt on land is forbidden you so long as ye are on the pilgrimage be mindful of your duty to allah unto whom ye will be gathered allah hath appointed the ka bah the sacred house standard for mankind and the sacred month and the offerings and the garlands that is so that ye may know that allah knoweth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth and that allah is knower of all things know that allah is severe in punishment but that allah also is forgiving merciful the duty of the messenger is only to convey the message allah knoweth what ye proclaim and what ye hide say the evil and the good are not alike even though the plenty of the evil attract thee so be mindful of your duty to allah men of understanding that ye may succeed ye who believe ask not of things which if they were made unto you would trouble you but if ye ask of them when the qur an is being revealed they will be made known unto you allah pardoneth this for allah is forgiving clement folk before you asked for such disclosures and then disbelieved therein allah hath not appointed anything in the nature of bahirah or sa ibah or wasilah or hami but those who disbelieve invent lie against allah most of them have no sense and when it is said unto them come unto that which allah hath revealed and unto the messenger they say enough for us is that wherein we found our fathers what even though their fathers had no knowledge whatsoever and no guidance ye who believe ye have charge of your own souls he who erreth cannot injure you if ye are rightly guided unto allah ye will all return and then he will inform you of what ye used to do ye who believe let there be witnesses between you when death draweth nigh unto one of you at the time of bequest two witnesses just men from among you or two others from another tribe in case ye are campaigning in the land and the calamity of death befall you ye shall empanel them both after the prayer and if ye doubt they shall be made to swear by allah saying we will not take bribe even though it were on behalf of near kinsman nor will we hide the testimony of allah for then indeed we should be of the sinful but then if it is afterwards ascertained that both of them merit the suspicion of sin let two others take their place of those nearly concerned and let them swear by allah saying verily our testimony is truer than their testimony and we have not transgressed the bounds of duty for them indeed we should be of the evil doers thus it is more likely that they will bear true witness or fear that after their oaths the oaths of others will be taken so be mindful of your duty to allah and hearken allah guideth not the froward folk in the day when allah gathereth together the messengers and saith what was your response from mankind they say we have no knowledge lo thou only thou art the knower of things hidden when allah saith jesus son of mary remember my favour unto thee and unto thy mother how strengthened thee with the holy spirit so that thou spakest unto mankind in the cradle as in maturity and how taught thee the scripture and wisdom and the torah and the gospel and how thou didst shape of clay as it were the likeness of bird by my permission and didst blow upon it and it was bird by my permission and thou didst heal him who was born blind and the leper by my permission and how thou didst raise the dead by my permission and how restrained the children of israel from harming thee when thou camest unto them with clear proofs and those of them who disbelieved exclaimed this is naught else than mere magic and when inspired the disciples saying believe in me and in my messenger they said we believe bear witness that we have surrendered unto thee we are muslims when the disciples said jesus son of mary is thy lord able to send down for us table spread with food from heaven he said observe your duty to allah if ye are true believers they said we wish to eat thereof that we may satisfy our hearts and know that thou hast spoken truth to us and that thereof we may be witnesses jesus spread with and for the the best of son of mary said allah lord of us send down for us table food from heaven that it may be feast for us for the first of us last of us and sign from thee give us sustenance for thou art sustainers allah said lo send it down for you and whoso disbelieveth of you afterward him surely will punish with punishment wherewith have not punished any of my creatures and when allah saith jesus son of mary didst thou say unto mankind take me and my mother for two gods beside allah he saith be glorified it was not mine to utter that to which had no right if used to say it then thou knewest it thou knowest what is in my mind and know not what is in thy mind lo thou only thou art the knower of things hidden spake unto them only that which thou commandedst me saying worship allah my lord and your lord was witness of them while dwelt among them and when thou tookest me thou wast the watcher over them thou art witness over all things if thou punish them lo they are thy slaves and if thou forgive them lo they are thy slaves lo thou only thou art the mighty the wise allah saith this is day in which their truthfulness profiteth the truthful for theirs are gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they are secure for ever allah taking pleasure in them and they in him that is the great triumph unto allah belongeth the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is therein and he is able to do all things sura al anaam cattle livestock praise be to allah who hath created the heavens and the earth and hath appointed darkness and light yet those who disbelieve ascribe rivals unto their lord he it is who hath created you from clay and hath decreed term for you term is fixed with him yet still ye doubt he is allah in the heavens and in the earth he knoweth both your secret and your utterance and he knoweth what ye earn never came there unto them revelation of the revelations of allah but they did turn away from it and they denied the truth when it came unto them but there will come unto them the tidings of that which they used to deride see they not how many generation we destroyed before them whom we had established in the earth more firmly than we have established you and we shed on them abundant showers from the sky and made the rivers flow beneath them yet we destroyed them for their sins and created after them another generation had we sent down unto thee muhammad actual writing upon parchment so that they could feel it with their hands those who disbelieve would have said this is naught else than mere magic they say why hath not an angel been sent down unto him if we sent down an angel then the matter would be judged no further time would be allowed them for reflection had we appointed him our messenger an angel we assuredly had made him as man that he might speak to men and thus obscured for them the truth they now obscure messengers of allah have been derided before thee but that whereat they scoffed surrounded such of them as did deride say unto the disbelievers travel in the land and see the nature of the consequence for the rejecters say unto whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth say unto allah he hath prescribed for himself mercy that he may bring you all together to the day of resurrection whereof there is no doubt those who ruin their souls will not believe unto him belongeth whatsoever resteth in the night and the day he is the hearer the knower say shall choose for protecting friend other than allah the originator of the heavens and the earth who feedeth and is never fed say am ordered to be the first to surrender unto him and be not thou muhammad of the idolaters say fear if rebel against my lord the retribution of an awful day he from whom such retribution is averted on that day allah hath in truth had mercy on him that will be the signal triumph if allah touch thee with affliction there is none that can relieve therefrom save him and if he touch thee with good fortune there is none that can impair it for he is able to do all things he is the omnipotent over his slaves and he is the wise the knower say muhammad what thing is of most weight in testimony say allah is witness between me and you and this qur an hath been inspired in me that may warn therewith you and whomsoever it may reach do ye in sooth bear witness that there are gods beside allah say bear no such witness say he is only one allah lo am innocent of that which ye associate with him those unto whom we gave the scripture recognise this revelation as they recognise their sons those who ruin their own souls will not believe who doth greater wrong than he who inventeth lie against allah or denieth his revelations lo the wrongdoers will not be successful and on the day we gather them together we shall say unto those who ascribed partners unto allah where are now those partners of your make believe then will they have no contention save that they will say by allah our lord we never were idolaters see how they lie against themselves and how the thing which they devised hath failed them of them are some who listen unto thee but we have placed upon their hearts veils lest they should understand and in their ears deafness if they saw every token they would not believe therein to the point that when they come unto thee to argue with thee the disbelievers say this is naught else than fables of the men of old and they forbid men from it and avoid it and they ruin none save themselves though they perceive not if thou couldst see when they are set before the fire and say oh would that we might return then would we not deny the revelations of our lord but we would be of the believers nay but that hath become clear unto them which before they used to hide and if they were sent back they would return unto that which they are forbidden lo they are liars and they say there is naught save our life of the world and we shall not be raised again if thou couldst see when they are set before their lord he will say is not this real they will say yea verily by our lord he will say taste now the retribution for that ye used to disbelieve they indeed are losers who deny their meeting with allah until when the hour cometh on them suddenly they cry alas for us that we neglected it they bear upon their backs their burdens ah evil is that which they bear naught is the life of the world save pastime and spot better far is the abode of the hereafter for those who keep their duty to allah have ye then no sense we know well how their talk grieveth thee though in truth they deny not thee muhammad but evil doers flout the revelations of allah messengers indeed have been denied before thee and they were patient under the denial and the persecution till our succour reached them there is none to alter the decisions of allah already there hath reached thee somewhat of the tidings of the messengers we sent before and if their aversion is grievous unto thee then if thou canst seek way down into the earth or ladder unto the sky that thou mayst bring unto them portent to convince them all if allah willed he could have brought them all together to the guidance so be not thou among the foolish ones only those can accept who hear as for the dead allah will raise them up then unto him they will be returned they say why hath no portent been sent down upon him from his lord say lo allah is able to send down portent but most of them know not there is not an animal in the earth nor flying creature flying on two wings but they are peoples like unto you we have neglected nothing in the book of our decrees then unto their lord they will be gathered those who deny our revelations are deaf and dumb in darkness whom allah will sendeth astray and whom he will he placeth on straight path say can ye see yourselves if the punishment of allah come upon you or the hour come upon you calling upon other than allah do ye then call for help to any other than allah answer that if ye are truthful nay but unto him ye call and he removeth that because of which ye call unto him if he will and ye forget whatever partners ye ascribed unto him we have sent already unto peoples that were before thee and we visited them with tribulation and adversity in order that they might grow humble if only when our disaster came on them they had been humble but their hearts were hardened and the devil made all that they used to do seem fair unto them then when they forgot that whereof they had been reminded we opened unto them the gates of all things till even as they were rejoicing in that which they were given we seized them unawares and lo they were dumbfounded so of the people who did wrong the last remnant was cut off praise be to allah lord of the worlds say have ye imagined if allah should take away your hearing and your sight and seal your hearts who is the allah who could restore it to you save allah see how we display the revelations unto them yet still they turn away say can ye see yourselves if the punishment of allah come upon you unawares or openly would any perish save wrongdoing folk we send not the messengers save as bearers of good news and warners whoso believeth and doeth right there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve but as for those who deny our revelations torment will afflict them for that they used to disobey say muhammad to the disbelievers say not unto you that possess the treasures of allah nor that have knowledge of the unseen and say not unto you lo am an angel follow only that which is inspired in me say are the blind man and the seer equal will ye not then take thought warn hereby those who fear because they know that they will be gathered unto their lord for whom there is no protecting ally nor intercessor beside him that they may ward off evil repel not those who call upon their lord at morn and evening seeking his countenance thou art not accountable for them in aught nor are they accountable for thee in aught that thou shouldst repel them and be of the wrong doers and even so do we try some of them by others that they say are these they whom allah favoureth among us is not allah best aware of the thanksgivers and when those who believe in our revelations come unto thee say peace be unto you your lord hath prescribed for himself mercy that whoso of you doeth evil through ignorance and repenteth afterward thereof and doeth right for him lo he is forgiving merciful thus do we expound the revelations that the way of the unrighteous may be manifest say am forbidden to worship those on whom ye call instead of allah say will not follow your desires for then should go astray and should not be of the rightly guided say am relying on clear proof from my lord while ye deny him have not that for which ye are impatient the decision is for allah only he telleth the truth and he is the best of deciders say if had that for which ye are impatient then would the case ere this have been decided between me and you allah is best aware of the wrongdoers and with him are the keys of the invisible none but he knoweth them and he knoweth what is in the land and the sea not leaf falleth but he knoweth it not grain amid the darkness of the earth naught of wet or dry but it is noted in clear record he it is who gathereth you at night and knoweth that which ye commit by day then he raiseth you again to life therein that the term appointed for you may be accomplished and afterward unto him is your return then he will proclaim unto you what ye used to do he is the omnipotent over his slaves he sendeth guardians over you until when death cometh unto one of you our messengers receive him and they neglect not then are they restored unto allah their lord the just surely his is the judgment and he is the most swift of reckoners say who delivereth you from the darkness of the land and the sea ye call upon him humbly and in secret saying if we are delivered from this fear we truly will be of the thankful say allah delivereth you from this and from all affliction yet ye attribute partners unto him say he is able to send punishment upon you from above you or from beneath your feet or to bewilder you with dissension and make you taste the tyranny one of another see how we display the revelations so that they may understand thy people muhammad have denied it though it is the truth say am not put in charge of you for every announcement there is term and ye will come to know and when thou seest those who meddle with our revelations withdraw from them until they meddle with another topic and if the devil cause thee to forget sit not after the remembrance with the congregation of wrong doers those who ward off evil are not accountable for them in aught but the reminder must be given them that haply they too may ward off evil and forsake those who take their religion for pastime and jest and whom the life of the world beguileth remind mankind hereby lest soul be destroyed by what it earneth it hath beside allah no protecting ally nor intercessor and though it offer every compensation it will not be accepted from it those are they who perish by their own deserts for them is drink of boiling water and painful doom because they disbelieved say shall we cry instead of unto allah unto that which neither profiteth us nor hurteth us and shall we turn back after allah hath guided us like one bewildered whom the devils have infatuated in the earth who hath companions who invite him to the guidance saying come unto us say lo the guidance of allah is guidance and we are ordered to surrender to the lord of the worlds and to establish worship and be dutiful to him and he it is unto whom ye will be gathered he it is who created the heavens and the earth in truth in the day when he saith be it is his word is the truth and his will be the sovereignty on the day when the trumpet is blown knower of the invisible and the visible he is the wise the aware remember when abraham said unto his father azar takest thou idols for gods lo see thee and thy folk in error manifest thus did we show abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth that he might be of those possessing certainty when the night grew dark upon him he beheld star he said this is my lord but when it set he said love not things that set and when he saw the moon uprising he exclaimed this is my lord but when it set he said unless my lord guide me surely shall become one of the folk who are astray and when he saw the sun uprising he cried this is my lord this is greater and when it set he exclaimed my people lo am free from all that ye associate with him lo have turned my face toward him who created the heavens and the earth as one by nature upright and am not of the idolaters his people argued with him he said dispute ye with me concerning allah when he hath guided me fear not at all that which ye set up beside him unless my lord willeth aught my lord includeth all things in his knowledge will ye not then remember how should fear that which ye set up beside him when ye fear not to set up beside allah that for which he hath revealed unto you no warrant which of the two factions hath more right to safety answer me that if ye have knowledge those who believe and obscure not their belief by wrongdoing theirs is safety and they are rightly guided that is our argument we gave it unto abraham against his folk we raise unto degrees of wisdom whom we will lo thy lord is wise aware and we bestowed upon him isaac and jacob each of them we guided and noah did we guide aforetime and of his seed we guided david and solomon and job and joseph and moses and aaron thus do we reward the good and zachariah and john and jesus and elias each one of them was of the righteous and ishmael and elisha and jonah and lot each one of them did we prefer above our creatures with some of their forefathers and their offspring and their brethren and we chose them and guided them unto straight path such is the guidance of allah wherewith he guideth whom he will of his bondmen but if they had set up for worship aught beside him all that they did would have been vain those are they unto whom we gave the scripture and command and prophethood but if these disbelieve therein then indeed we shall entrust it to people who will not be disbelievers therein those are they whom allah guideth so follow their guidance say muhammad unto mankind ask of you no fee for it lo it is naught but reminder to his creatures and they measure not the power of allah its true measure when they say allah hath naught revealed unto human being say unto the jews who speak thus who revealed the book which moses brought light and guidance for mankind which ye have put on parchments which ye show but ye hide much thereof and by which ye were taught that which ye knew not yourselves nor did your fathers know it say allah then leave them to their play of cavilling and this is blessed scripture which we have revealed confirming that which was revealed before it that thou mayst warn the mother of villages and those around her those who believe in the hereafter believe herein and they are careful of their worship who is guilty of more wrong than he who forgeth lie against allah or saith am inspired when he is not inspired in aught and who saith will reveal the like of that which allah hath revealed if thou couldst see when the wrong doers reach the pangs of death and the angels stretch their hands out saying deliver up your souls this day ye are awarded doom of degradation for that ye spake concerning allah other than the truth and used to scorn his portents now have ye come unto us solitary as we did create you at the first and ye have left behind you all that we bestowed upon you and we behold not with you those your intercessors of whom ye claimed that they possessed share in you now is the bond between you severed and that which ye presumed hath failed you lo allah it is who splitteth the grain of corn and the date stone for sprouting he bringeth forth the living from the dead and is the bringer forth of the dead from the living such is allah how then are ye perverted he is the cleaver of the daybreak and he hath appointed the night for stillness and the sun and the moon for reckoning that is the measuring of the mighty the wise and he it is who hath set for you the stars that ye may guide your course by them amid the darkness of the land and the sea we have detailed our revelations for people who have knowledge and he it is who hath produced you from single being and hath given you habitation and repository we have detailed our revelations for people who have understanding he it is who sendeth down water from the sky and therewith we bring forth buds of every kind we bring forth the green blade from which we bring forth the thick clustered grain and from the date palm from the pollen thereof spring pendant bunches and we bring forth gardens of grapes and the olive and the pomegranate alike and unlike look upon the fruit thereof when they bear fruit and upon its ripening lo herein verily are portents for people who believe yet they ascribe as partners unto him the jinn although he did create them and impute falsely without knowledge sons and daughters unto him glorified be he and high exalted above all that they ascribe unto him the originator of the heavens and the earth how can he have child when there is for him no consort when he created all things and is aware of all things such is allah your lord there is no allah save him the creator of all things so worship him and he taketh care of all things vision comprehendeth him not but he comprehendeth all vision he is the subtile the aware proofs have come unto you from your lord so whoso seeth it is for his own good and whoso is blind is blind to his own hurt and am not keeper over you thus do we display our revelations that they may say unto thee muhammad thou hast studied and that we may make it clear for people who have knowledge follow that which is inspired in thee from thy lord there is no allah save him and turn away from the idolaters had allah willed they had not been idolatrous we have not set thee as keeper over them nor art thou responsible for them revile not those unto whom they pray beside allah lest they wrongfully revile allah through ignorance thus unto every nation have we made their deed seem fair then unto their lord is their return and he will tell them what they used to do and they swear solemn oath by allah that if there come unto them portent they will believe therein say portents are with allah and so is that which telleth you that if such came unto them they would not believe we confound their hearts and their eyes as they believed not therein at the first we let them wander blindly on in their contumacy and though we should send down the angels unto them and the dead should speak unto them and we should gather against them all things in array they would not believe unless allah so willed howbeit most of them are ignorant thus have we appointed unto every prophet an adversary devils of humankind and jinn who inspire in one another plausible discourse through guile if thy lord willed they would not do so so leave them alone with their devising that the hearts of those who believe not in the hereafter may incline thereto and that they may take pleasure therein and that they may earn what they are earning shall seek other than allah for judge when he it is who hath revealed unto you this scripture fully explained those unto whom we gave the scripture aforetime know that it is revealed from thy lord in truth so be not thou muhammad of the waverers perfected is the word of thy lord in truth and justice there is naught that can change his words he is the hearer the knower if thou obeyedst most of those on earth they would mislead thee far from allah way they follow naught but an opinion and they do but guess lo thy lord he knoweth best who erreth from his way and he knoweth best who are the rightly guided eat of that over which the name of allah hath been mentioned if ye are believers in his revelations how should ye not eat of that over which the name of allah hath been mentioned when he hath explained unto you that which is forbidden unto you unless ye are compelled thereto but lo many are led astray by their own lusts through ignorance lo thy lord he is best aware of the transgressors forsake the outwardness of sin and the inwardness thereof lo those who garner sin will be awarded that which they have earned and eat not of that whereon allah name hath not been mentioned for lo it is abomination lo the devils do inspire their minions to dispute with you but if ye obey them ye will be in truth idolaters is he who was dead and we have raised him unto life and set for him light wherein he walketh among men as him whose similitude is in utter darkness whence he cannot emerge thus is their conduct made fairseeming for the disbelievers and thus have we made in every city great ones of its wicked ones that they should plot therein they do but plot against themselves though they perceive not and when token cometh unto them they say we will not believe till we are given that which allah messengers are given allah knoweth best with whom to place his message humiliation from allah and heavy punishment will smite the guilty for their scheming and whomsoever it is allah will to guide he expandeth his bosom unto the surrender and whomsoever it is his will to send astray he maketh his bosom close and narrow as if he were engaged in sheer ascent thus allah layeth ignominy upon those who believe not this is the path of thy lord straight path we have detailed our revelations for people who take heed for them is the abode of peace with their lord he will be their protecting friend because of what they used to do in the day when he will gather them together he will say ye assembly of the jinn many of humankind did ye seduce and their adherents among humankind will say our lord we enjoyed one another but now we have arrived at the appointed term which thou appointedst for us he will say fire is your home abide therein for ever save him whom allah willeth to deliver lo thy lord is wise aware thus we let some of the wrong doers have power over others because of what they are wont to earn ye assembly of the jinn and humankind came there not unto you messengers of your own who recounted unto you my tokens and warned you of the meeting of this your day they will say we testify against ourselves and the life of the world beguiled them and they testify against themselves that they were disbelievers this is because thy lord destroyeth not the townships arbitrarily while their people are unconscious of the wrong they do for all there will be ranks from what they did thy lord is not unaware of what they do thy lord is the absolute the lord of mercy if he will he can remove you and can cause what he will to follow after you even as he raised you from the seed of other folk lo that which ye are promised will surely come to pass and ye cannot escape say muhammad my people work according to your power lo too am working thus ye will come to know for which of us will be the happy sequel lo the wrong doers will not be successful they assign unto allah of the crops and cattle which he created portion and they say this is allah in their make believe and this is for his partners in regard to us thus that which they assign unto his partners in them reacheth not allah and that which they assign unto allah goeth to their so called partners evil is their ordinance thus have their so called partners of allah made the killing of their children to seem fair unto many of the idolaters that they may ruin them and make their faith obscure for them had allah willed it otherwise they had not done so so leave them alone with their devices and they say such cattle and crops are forbidden no one is to eat of them save whom we will in their make believe cattle whose backs are forbidden cattle over which they mention not the name of allah all that is lie against him he will repay them for that which they invent and they say that which is in the bellies of such cattle is reserved for our males and is forbidden to our wives but if it be born dead then they all may be partakers thereof he will reward them for their attribution of such ordinances unto him lo he is wise aware they are losers who besottedly have slain their children without knowledge and have forbidden that which allah bestowed upon them inventing lie against allah they indeed have gone astray and are not guided he it is who produceth gardens trellised and untrellised and the datepalm and crops of divers flavour and the olive and the pomegranate like and unlike eat ye of the fruit thereof when it fruiteth and pay the due thereof upon the harvest day and be not prodigal lo allah loveth not the prodigals and of the cattle he produceth some for burdens some for food eat of that which allah hath bestowed upon you and follow not the footsteps of the devil for lo he is an open foe to you eight pairs of the sheep twain and of the goats twain say hath he forbidden the two males or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain expound to me the case with knowledge if ye are truthful and of the camels twain and of the oxen twain say hath he forbidden the two males or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain or were ye by to witness when allah commanded you all this then who doth greater wrong than he who deviseth lie concerning allah that he may lead mankind astray without knowledge lo allah guideth not wrongdoing folk say find not in that which is revealed unto me aught prohibited to an eater that he eat thereof except it be carrion or blood poured forth or swineflesh for that verily is foul or the abomination which was immolated to the name of other than allah but whoso is compelled thereto neither craving nor transgressing for him lo thy lord is forgiving merciful unto those who are jews we forbade every animal with claws and of the oxen and the sheep forbade we unto them the fat thereof save that upon the backs or the entrails or that which is mixed with the bone that we awarded them for their rebellion and lo we verily are truthful so if they give the lie to thee muhammad say your lord is lord of all embracing mercy and his wrath will never be withdrawn from guilty folk they who are idolaters will say had allah willed we had not ascribed unto him partners neither had our fathers nor had we forbidden aught thus did those who were before them give the lie to allah messengers till they tasted of the fear of us say have ye any knowledge that ye can adduce for us lo ye follow naught but an opinion lo ye do but guess say for allah is the final argument had he willed he could indeed have guided all of you say come bring your witnesses who can bear witness that allah forbade all this and if they bear witness do not thou bear witness with them follow thou not the whims of those who deny our revelations those who believe not in the hereafter and deem others equal with their lord say come will recite unto you that which your lord hath made sacred duty for you that ye ascribe no thing as partner unto him and that ye do good to parents and that ye slay not your children because of penury we provide for you and for them and that ye draw not nigh to lewd things whether open or concealed and that ye slay not the life which allah hath made sacred save in the course of justice this he hath command you in order that ye may discern and approach not the wealth of the orphan save with that which is better till he reach maturity give full measure and full weight in justice we task not any soul beyond its scope and if ye give your word do justice thereunto even though it be against kinsman and fulfil the covenant of allah this he commandeth you that haply ye may remember and he commandeth you saying this is my straight path so follow it follow not other ways lest ye be parted from his way this hath he ordained for you that ye may ward off evil again we gave the scripture unto moses complete for him who would do good an explanation of all things guidance and mercy that they might believe in the meeting with their lord and this is blessed scripture which we have revealed so follow it and ward off evil that ye may find mercy lest ye should say the scripture was revealed only to two sects before us and we in sooth were unaware of what they read or lest ye should say if the scripture had been revealed unto us we surely had been better guided than are they now hath there come unto you clear proof from your lord guidance and mercy and who doeth greater wrong than he who denieth the revelations of allah and turneth away from them we award unto those who turn away from our revelations an evil doom because of their aversion wait they indeed for nothing less than that the angels should come unto them or thy lord should come or there should come one of the portents from thy lord in the day when one of the portents from thy lord cometh its belief availeth naught soul which theretofore believed not nor in its belief earned good by works say wait ye lo we too are waiting lo as for those who sunder their religion and become schismatics no concern at all hast thou with them their case will go to allah who then will tell them what they used to do whoso bringeth good deed will receive tenfold the like thereof while whoso bringeth an ill deed will be awarded but the like thereof and they will not be wronged say lo as for me my lord hath guided me unto straight path right religion the community of abraham the upright who was no idolater say lo my worship and my sacrifice and my living and my dying are for allah lord of the worlds he hath no partner this am commanded and am first of those who surrender unto him say shall seek another than allah for lord when he is lord of all things each soul earneth only on its own account nor doth any laden bear another load then unto your lord is your return and he will tell you that wherein ye differed he it is who hath placed you as viceroys of the earth and hath exalted some of you in rank above others that he may try you by the test of that which he hath given you lo thy lord is swift in prosecution and lo he verily is forgiving merciful sura al araf the heights alif lam mim sad it is scripture that is revealed unto thee muhammad so let there be no heaviness in thy heart therefrom that thou mayst warn thereby and it is reminder unto believers saying follow that which is sent down unto you from your lord and follow no protecting friends beside him little do ye recollect how many township have we destroyed as raid by night or while they slept at noon our terror came unto them no plea had they when our terror came unto them save that they said lo we were wrong doers then verily we shall question those unto whom our message hath been sent and verily we shall question the messengers then verily we shall narrate unto them the event with knowledge for we were not absent when it came to pass the weighing on that day is the true weighing as for those whose scale is heavy they are the successful and as for those whose scale is light those are they who lose their souls because they used to wrong our revelations and we have given you mankind power in the earth and appointed for you therein livelihoods little give ye thanks and we created you then fashioned you then told the angels fall ye prostrate before adam and they fell prostrate all save iblis who was not of those who make prostration he said what hindered thee that thou didst not fall prostrate when bade thee iblis said am better than him thou createdst me of fire while him thou didst create of mud he said then go down hence it is not for thee to show pride here so go forth lo thou art of those degraded he said reprieve me till the day when they are raised from the dead he said lo thou art of those reprieved he said now because thou hast sent me astray verily shall lurk in ambush for them on thy right path then shall come upon them from before them and from behind them and from their right hands and from their left hands and thou wilt not find most of them beholden unto thee he said go forth from hence degraded banished as for such of them as follow thee surely will fill hell with all of you and unto man adam dwell thou and thy wife in the garden and eat from whence ye will but come not nigh this tree lest ye become wrong doers then satan whispered to them that he might manifest unto them that which was hidden from them of their shame and he said your lord forbade you from this tree only lest ye should become angels or become of the immortals and he swore unto them saying lo am sincere adviser unto you thus did he lead them on with guile and when they tasted of the tree their shame was manifest to them and they began to hide by heaping on themselves some of the leaves of the garden and their lord called them saying did not forbid you from that tree and tell you lo satan is an open enemy to you they said our lord we have wronged ourselves if thou forgive us not and have not mercy on us surely we are of the lost he said go down from hence one of you foe unto the other there will be for you on earth habitation and provision for while he said there shall ye live and there shall ye die and thence shall ye be brought forth children of adam we have revealed unto you raiment to conceal your shame and splendid vesture but the raiment of restraint from evil that is best this is of the revelations of allah that they may remember children of adam let not satan seduce you as he caused your first parents to go forth from the garden and tore off from them their robe of innocence that he might manifest their shame to them lo he seeth you he and his tribe from whence ye see him not lo we have made the devils protecting friends for those who believe not and when they do some lewdness they say we found our fathers doing it and allah hath enjoined it on us say allah verily enjoineth not lewdness tell ye concerning allah that which ye know not say my lord enjoineth justice and set your faces upright toward him at every place of worship and call upon him making religion pure for him only as he brought you into being so return ye unto him party hath he led aright while error hath just hold over another party for lo they choose the devils for protecting supporters instead of allah and deem that they are rightly guided children of adam look to your adornment at every place of worship and eat and drink but be not prodigal lo he loveth not the prodigals say who hath forbidden the adornment of allah which he hath brought forth for his bondmen and the good things of his providing say such on the day of resurrection will be only for those who believed during the life of the world thus do we detail our revelations for people who have knowledge say my lord forbiddeth only indecencies such of them as are apparent and such as are within and sin and wrongful oppression and that ye associate with allah that for which no warrant hath been revealed and that ye tell concerning allah that which ye know not and every nation hath its term and when its term cometh they cannot put it off an hour nor yet advance it children of adam when messengers of your own come unto you who narrate unto you my revelations then whosoever refraineth from evil and amendeth there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve but they who deny our revelations and scorn them each are rightful owners of the fire they will abide therein who doeth greater wrong than he who inventeth lie concerning allah or denieth our tokens for such their appointed portion of the book of destiny reacheth them till when our messengers come to gather them they say where now is that to which ye cried beside allah they say they have departed from us and they testify against themselves that they were disbelievers he saith enter into the fire among nations of the jinn and humankind who passed away before you every time nation entereth it curseth its sister nation till when they have all been made to follow one another thither the last of them saith unto the first of them our lord these led us astray so give them double torment of the fire he saith for each one there is double torment but ye know not and the first of them saith unto the last of them ye were no whit better than us so taste the doom for what ye used to earn lo they who deny our revelations and scorn them for them the gates of heaven will nor be opened not will they enter the garden until the camel goeth through the needle eye thus do we requite the guilty theirs will be bed of hell and over them coverings of hell thus do we requite wrong doers but as for those who believe and do good works we tax not any soul beyond its scope such are rightful owners of the garden they abide therein and we remove whatever rancour may be in their hearts rivers flow beneath them and they say the praise to allah who hath guided us to this we could not truly have been led aright if allah had not guided us verily the messengers of our lord did bring the truth and it is cried unto them this is the garden ye inherit it for what ye used to do and the dwellers found that which our that which your lord between them crieth of the garden cry unto the dwellers of the fire we have lord promised us to be the truth have ye too found promised the truth they say yea verily and crier in the curse of allah is on evil doers who debar men from the path of allah and would have it crooked and who are disbelievers in the last day between them is veil and on the heights are men who know them all by their marks and they call unto the dwellers of the garden peace be unto you they enter it not although they hope to enter and when their eyes are turned toward the dwellers of the fire they say our lord place us not with the wrong doing folk and the dwellers on the heights call unto men whom they know by their marks saying what did your multitude and that in which ye took your pride avail you are these they of whom ye swore that allah would not show them mercy unto them it hath been said enter the garden no fear shall come upon you nor is it ye who will grieve and the dwellers of the fire cry out unto the dwellers of the garden pour on us some water or some wherewith allah hath provided you they say lo allah hath forbidden both to disbelievers in his guidance who took their religion for sport and pastime and whom the life of the world beguiled so this day we have forgotten them even as they forgot the meeting of this their day and as they used to deny our tokens verily we have brought them scripture which we expounded with knowledge guidance and mercy for people who believe await they aught save the fulfilment thereof on the day when the fulfilment thereof cometh those who were before forgetful thereof will say the messengers of our lord did bring the truth have we any intercessors that they may intercede for us or can we be returned to life on earth that we may act otherwise than we used to act they have lost their souls and that which they devised hath failed them lo your lord is allah who created the heavens and the earth in six days then mounted he the throne he covereth the night with the day which is in haste to follow it and hath made the sun and the moon and the stars subservient by his command his verily is all creation and commandment blessed be allah the lord of the worlds mankind call upon your lord humbly and in secret lo he loveth not aggressors work not confusion in the earth after the fair ordering thereof and call on him in fear and hope lo the mercy of allah is nigh unto the good and he it is who sendeth the winds as tidings heralding his mercy till when they bear cloud heavy with rain we lead it to dead land and then cause water to descend thereon and thereby bring forth fruits of every kind thus bring we forth the dead haply ye may remember as for the good land its vegetation cometh forth by permission of its lord while as for that which is bad only the useless cometh forth from it thus do we recount the tokens for people who give thanks we sent noah of old unto his people and he said my people serve allah ye have no other allah save him lo fear for you the retribution of an awful day the chieftains of his people said lo we see thee surely in plain error he said my people there is no error in me but am messenger from the lord of the worlds convey unto you the messages of my lord and give good counsel unto you and know from allah that which ye know not marvel ye that there should come unto you reminder from your lord by means of man among you that he may warn you and that ye may keep from evil and that haply ye may find mercy but they denied him so we saved him and those with him in the ship and we drowned those who denied our tokens lo they were blind folk and unto the tribe of ad we sent their brother hud he said my people serve allah ye have no other allah save him will ye not ward off evil the chieftains of his people who were disbelieving said lo we surely see thee in foolishness and lo we deem thee of the liars he said my people there is no foolishness in me but am messenger from the lord of the worlds convey unto you the messages of my lord and am for you true adviser marvel ye that there should of man among you that he may after noah folk and gave you of your lord that haply ye may come unto you reminder from your lord by means warn you remember how he made you viceroys growth of stature remember all the bounties be successful they said hast come unto us that we should serve allah alone and forsake what our fathers worshipped then bring upon us that wherewith thou threatenest us if thou art of the truthful he said terror and wrath from your lord have already fallen on you would ye wrangle with me over names which ye have named ye and your fathers for which no warrant from allah hath been revealed then await the consequence lo also am of those awaiting it and we saved him and those with him by mercy from us and we cut the root of those who denied our revelations and were not believers and to the tribe of thamud we sent their brother salih he said my people serve allah ye have no other allah save him wonder from your lord hath come unto you lo this is the camel of allah token unto you so let her feed in allah earth and touch her not with hurt lest painful torment seize you and remember how he made you viceroys after ad and gave you station in the earth ye choose castles in the plains and hew the mountains into dwellings so remember all the bounties of allah and do not evil making mischief in the earth the chieftains of his people who were scornful said unto those whom they despised unto such of them as believed know ye that salih is one sent from his lord they said lo in that wherewith he hath been sent we are believers those who were scornful said lo in that which ye believe we are disbelievers so they hamstrung the she camel and they flouted the commandment of their lord and they said salih bring upon us that thou threatenest if thou art indeed of those sent from allah so the earthquake seized them and morning found them prostrate in their dwelling place and salih turned from them and said my people delivered my lord message unto you and gave you good advice but ye love not good advisers and lot remember when he said unto his folk will ye commit abomination such as no creature ever did before you lo ye come with lust unto men instead of women nay but ye are wanton folk and the answer of his people was only that they said one to another turn them out of your township they are folk forsooth who keep pure and we rescued him and his household save his wife who was of those who stayed behind and we rained rain upon them see now the nature of the consequence of evil doers and unto midian we sent their brother shu eyb he said my people serve allah ye have no other allah save him lo clear proof hath come unto you from your lord so give full measure and full weight and wrong not mankind in their goods and work not confusion in the earth after the fair ordering thereof that will be better for you if ye are believers lurk not on every road to threaten wayfarers and to turn away from allah path him who believeth in him and to seek to make it crooked and remember when ye were but few how he did multiply you and see the nature of the consequence for the corrupters and if there is party of you which believeth in that wherewith have been sent and there is party which believeth not then have patience until allah judge between us he is the best of all who deal in judgment the chieftains of his people who were scornful said surely we will drive thee out shu eyb and those who believe with thee from our township unless ye return to our religion he said even though we hate it we should have invented lie against allah if we returned to your religion after allah hath rescued us from it it is not for us to return to it unless allah our lord should so will our lord comprehendeth all things in knowledge in allah do we put our trust our lord decide with truth between us and our folk for thou art the best of those who make decision but the chieftains of his people who were disbelieving said if ye follow shu eyb then truly ye shall be the losers so the earthquake seized them and morning found them prostrate in their dwelling place those who denied shu eyb became as though they had not dwelt there those who denied shu eyb they were the losers so he turned from them and said my people delivered my lord messages unto you and gave you good advice then how can sorrow for people that rejected truth and we sent no prophet unto any township but we did afflict its folk with tribulation and adversity that haply they might grow humble then changed we the evil plight for good till they grew affluent and said tribulation and distress did touch our fathers then we seized them unawares when they perceived not and if the people of the townships had believed and kept from evil surely we should have opened for them blessings from the sky and from the earth but unto every messenger they gave the lie and so we seized them on account of what they used to earn are the people of the townships then secure from the coming of our wrath upon them as night raid while they sleep or are the people of the townships then secure from the coming of our wrath upon them in the daytime while they play are they then secure from allah scheme none deemeth himself secure from allah scheme save folk that perish is it not an indication to those who inherit the land after its people who thus reaped the consequence of evil doing that if we will we can smite them for their sins and print upon their hearts so that they hear not such were the townships we relate some tidings of them unto thee muhammad their messengers verily came unto them with clear proofs of allah sovereignty but they could not believe because they had before denied thus doth allah print upon the hearts of disbelievers that they hear not we found no loyalty to any covenant in most of them nay most of them we found wrong doers then after them we sent moses with our tokens unto pharaoh and his chiefs but they repelled them now see the nature of the consequence for the corrupters moses said pharaoh lo am messenger from the lord of the worlds approved upon condition that speak concerning allah nothing but the truth come unto you lords of egypt with clear proof from your lord so let the children of israel go with me pharaoh said if thou comest with token then produce it if thou art of those who speak the truth then he flung down his staff and lo it was serpent manifest and he drew forth his hand from his bosom and lo it was white for the beholders the chiefs of pharaoh people said lo this is some knowing wizard who would expel you from your land now what do ye advise they said unto pharaoh put him off while him and his brother and send into the cities summoners to bring each knowing wizard unto thee and the wizards came to pharaoh saying surely there will be reward for us if we are victors he answered yes and surely ye shall be of those brought near to me they said moses either throw first or let us be the first throwers he said throw and when they threw they cast spell upon the people eyes and overawed them and produced mighty spell and we inspired moses saying throw thy staff and lo it swallowed up their lying show thus was the truth vindicated and that which they were doing was made vain thus were they there defeated and brought low and the wizards fell down prostrate crying we believe in the lord of the worlds the lord of moses and aaron pharaoh said ye believe in him before give you leave lo this is the plot that ye have plotted in the city that ye may drive its people hence but ye shall come to know surely shall have your hands and feet cut off upon alternate sides then shall crucify you every one they said lo we are about to return unto our lord thou takest vengeance on us only forasmuch as we believed the tokens of our lord when they came unto us our lord vouchsafe unto us steadfastness and make us die as men who have surrendered unto thee the chiefs of pharaoh people said king wilt thou suffer moses and his people to make mischief in the land and flout thee and thy gods he said we will slay their sons and spare their women for lo we are in power over them and moses said unto his people seek help in allah and endure lo the earth is allah he giveth it for an inheritance to whom he will and lo the sequel is for those who keep their duty unto him they said we suffered hurt before thou camest unto us and since thou hast come unto us he said it may be that your lord is going to destroy your adversary and make you viceroys in the earth that he may see how ye behave and we straitened pharaoh folk with famine and dearth of fruits that peradventure they might heed but whenever good befell them they said this is ours and whenever evil smote them they ascribed it to the evil auspices of moses and those with him surely their evil auspice was only with allah but most of them knew not and they said whatever portent thou bringest wherewith to bewitch us we shall not put faith in thee so we sent against them the flood and the locusts and the vermin and the frogs and the blood succession of clear signs but they were arrogant and became guilty folk and when the terror fell on them they cried moses pray for us unto thy lord because he hath covenant with thee if thou removest the terror from us we verily will trust thee and will let the children of israel go with thee but when we did remove from them the terror for term which they must reach behold they broke their covenant therefore we took retribution from them therefore we drowned them in the sea because they denied our revelations and were heedless of them and we caused the folk who were despised to inherit the eastern parts of the land and the western parts thereof which we had blessed and the fair word of thy lord was fulfilled for the children of israel because of their endurance and we annihilated all that pharaoh and his folk had done and that they had contrived and we brought the children of israel across the sea and they came unto people who were given up to idols which they had they said moses make for us god even as they have gods he said lo ye are folk who know not lo as for these their way will be destroyed and all that they are doing is in vain he said shall seek for you god other than allah when he hath favoured you above all creatures and remember when we did deliver you from pharaoh folk who were afflicting you with dreadful torment slaughtering your sons and sparing your women that was tremendous trial from your lord and when we did appoint for moses thirty nights of solitude and added to them ten and he completed the whole time appointed by his lord of forty nights and moses said unto his brother aaron take my place among the people do right and follow not the way of mischief makers and when moses came to our appointed tryst and his lord had spoken unto him he said my lord show me thy self that may gaze upon thee he said thou wilt not see me but gaze upon the mountain if it stand still in its place then thou wilt see me and when his lord revealed his glory to the mountain he sent it crashing down and moses fell down senseless and when he woke he said glory unto thee turn unto thee repentant and am the first of true believers he said moses have preferred thee above mankind by my messages and by my speaking unto thee so hold that which have given thee and be among the thankful and we wrote for him upon the tablets the lesson to be drawn from all things and the explanation of all things then bade him hold it fast and command thy people saying take the better course made clear therein shall show thee the abode of evil livers shall turn away from my revelations those who magnify themselves wrongfully in the earth and if they see each token believe it not and if they see the way of righteousness choose it nor for their way and if they see the way of error choose if for their way that is because they deny our revelations and are used to disregard them those who deny our revelations and the meeting of the hereafter their works are fruitless are they requited aught save what they used to do and the folk of moses after he left them chose calf for worship made out of their ornaments of saffron hue which gave lowing sound saw they not that it spake not unto them nor guided them to any way they chose it and became wrong doers and when they feared the consequences thereof and saw that they had gone astray they said unless our lord have mercy on us and forgive us we verily are of the lost and when moses returned unto his people angry and grieved he said evil is that course which ye took after had left you would ye hasten on the judgment of your lord and he cast down the tablets and he seized his brother by the head dragging him toward him he said son of my mother lo the folk did judge me weak and almost killed me oh make not mine enemies to triumph over me and place me not among the evil doers he said my lord have mercy on me and on my brother bring us into thy mercy thou the most merciful of all who show mercy lo those who chose the calf for worship terror from their lord and humiliation will come upon them in the life of the world thus do we requite those who invent lie but those who do ill deeds and afterward repent and believe lo for them afterward allah is forgiving merciful then when the anger of moses abated he took up the tablets and in their inscription there was guidance and mercy for all those who fear their lord and moses chose of his people seventy men for our appointed tryst and when the trembling came on them he said my lord if thou hadst willed thou hadst destroyed them long before and me with them wilt thou destroy us for that which the ignorant among us did it is but thy trial of us thou sendest whom thou wilt astray and guidest whom thou wilt thou art our protecting friend therefore forgive us and have mercy on us thou the best of all who show forgiveness and ordain for us in this world that which is good and in the hereafter that which is good lo we have turned unto thee he said smite with my punishment whom will and my mercy embraceth all things therefore shall ordain it for those who ward off evil and pay the poor due and those who believe our revelations those who follow the messenger the prophet who can neither read nor write whom they will find described in the torah and the gospel which are with them he will enjoin on them that which is right and forbid them that which is wrong he will make lawful for them all good things and prohibit for them only the foul and he will relieve them of their burden and the fetters that they used to wear then those who believe in him and honour him and help him and follow the light which is sent down with him they are the successful say muhammad mankind lo am the messenger of allah to you all the messenger of him unto whom belongeth the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth there is no allah save him he quickeneth and he giveth death so believe in allah and his messenger the prophet who can neither read nor write who believeth in allah and in his words and follow him that haply ye may be led aright and of moses folk there is community who lead with truth and establish justice therewith we divided them into twelve tribes nations and we inspired moses when his people asked him for water saying smite with thy staff the rock and there gushed forth therefrom twelve springs so that each tribe knew their drinkingplace and we caused the white cloud to overshadow them and sent down for them the manna and the quails saying eat of the good things wherewith we have provided you they wronged us not but they were wont to wrong themselves and when it was said unto them dwell in this township and eat therefrom whence ye will and say repentance and enter the gate prostrate we shall forgive you your sins we shall increase reward for the right doers but those of them who did wrong changed the word which had been told them for another saying and we sent down upon them wrath from heaven for their wrongdoing ask them muhammad of the township that was by the sea how they did break the sabbath how their big fish came unto them visibly upon their sabbath day and on day when they did not keep sabbath came they not unto them thus did we try them for that they were evil livers and when community among them said why preach ye to folk whom allah is about to destroy or punish with an awful doom they said in order to be free from guilt before your lord and that haply they may ward off evil and when they forgot that whereof they had been reminded we rescued those who forbade wrong and visited those who did wrong with dreadful punishment because they were evil livers so when they took pride in that which they had been forbidden we said unto them be ye apes despised and loathed and remember when thy lord proclaimed that he would raise against them till the day of resurrection those who would lay on them cruel torment lo verily thy lord is swift in prosecution and lo verily he is forgiving merciful and we have sundered them in the earth as separate nations some of them are righteous and some far from that and we have tried them with good things and evil things that haply they might return and generation hath succeeded them who inherited the scriptures they grasp the goods of this low life as the price of evil doing and say it will be forgiven us and if there came to them again the offer of the like they would accept it and would sin again hath not the covenant of the scripture been taken on their behalf that they should not speak aught concerning allah save the truth and they have studied that which is therein and the abode of the hereafter is better for those who ward off evil have ye then no sense and as for those who make men keep the scripture and establish worship lo we squander not the wages of reformers and when we shook the mount above them as it were covering and they supposed that it was going to fall upon them and we said hold fast that which we have given you and remember that which is therein that ye may ward off evil and remember when thy lord brought forth from the children of adam from their reins their seed and made them testify of themselves saying am not your lord they said yea verily we testify that was lest ye should say at the day of resurrection lo of this we were unaware or lest ye should say it is only that our fathers ascribed partners to allah of old and we were their seed after them wilt thou destroy us on account of that which those who follow falsehood did thus we detail the revelations that haply they may return recite unto them the tale of him to whom we gave our revelations but he sloughed them off so satan overtook him and he became of those who lead astray and had we willed we could have raised him by their means but he clung to the earth and followed his own lust therefor his likeness is as the likeness of dog if thou attackest him he panteth with his tongue out and if thou leavest him he panteth with his tongue out such is the likeness of the people who deny our revelations narrate unto them the history of the men of old that haply they may take thought evil as an example are the folk who denied our revelations and were wont to wrong themselves he whom allah leadeth he indeed is led aright while he whom allah sendeth astray they indeed are losers already have we urged unto hell many of the jinn and humankind having hearts wherewith they understand not and having eyes wherewith they see not and having ears wherewith they hear not these are as the cattle nay but they are worse these are the neglectful allah are the fairest names invoke him by them and leave the company of those who blaspheme his names they will be requited what they do and of those whom we created there is nation who guide with the truth and establish justice therewith and those who deny our revelations step by step we lead them on from whence they know not give them rein for lo my scheme is strong have they not bethought them that there is no madness in their comrade he is but plain warner have they not considered the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what things allah hath created and that it may be that their own term draweth nigh in what fact after this will they believe those whom allah sendeth astray there is no guide for them he leaveth them to wander blindly on in their contumacy they ask thee of the destined hour when will it come to port say knowledge thereof is with my lord only he alone will manifest it at its proper time it is heavy in the heavens and the earth it cometh not to you save unawares they question thee as if thou couldst be well informed thereof say knowledge thereof is with allah only but most of mankind know not say for myself have no power to benefit nor power to hurt save that which allah willeth had knowledge of the unseen should have abundance of wealth and adversity would not touch me am but warner and bearer of good tidings unto folk who believe he it is who did create you from single soul and therefrom did make his mate that he might take rest in her and when he covered her she bore light burden and she passed unnoticed with it but when it became heavy they cried unto allah their lord saying if thou givest unto us aright we shall be of the thankful but when he gave unto them aright they ascribed unto him partners in respect of that which he had given them high is he exalted above all that they associate with him attribute they as partners to allah those who created naught but are themselves created and cannot give them help nor can they help themselves and if ye call them to the guidance they follow you not whether ye call them or are silent is all one for you lo those on whom ye call beside allah are slaves like unto you call on them now and let them answer you if ye are truthful have they feet wherewith they walk or have they hands wherewith they hold or have they eyes wherewith they see or have they ears wherewith they hear say call upon your so called partners of allah and then contrive against me spare me not lo my protecting friend is allah who revealeth the scripture he befriendeth the righteous they on whom ye call beside him have no power to help you nor can they help you nor can they help themselves and if ye muslims call them to the guidance they hear not and thou muhammad seest them looking toward thee but they see not keep to forgiveness muhammad and enjoin kindness and turn away from the ignorant and if slander from the devil wound thee then seek refuge in allah lo he is hearer knower lo those who ward off evil when glamour from the devil troubleth them they do but remember allah guidance and behold them seers their brethren plunge them further into error and cease not and when thou bringest not verse for them they say why hast thou not chosen it say follow only that which is inspired in me from my lord this qur an is insight from your lord and guidance and mercy for people that believe and when the qur an is recited give ear to it and pay heed that ye may obtain mercy and do thou muhammad remember thy lord within thyself humbly and with awe below thy breath at morn and evening and be not thou of the neglectful lo those who are with thy lord are not too proud to do him service but they praise him and prostrate before him sura al anfal spoils of war booty they ask thee muhammad of the spoils of war say the spoils of war belong to allah and the messenger so keep your duty to allah and adjust the matter of your difference and obey allah and his messenger if ye are true believers they only are the true believers whose hearts feel fear when allah is mentioned and when his revelations are recited unto them they increase their faith and who trust in their lord who establish worship and spend of that we have bestowed on them those are they who are in truth believers for them are grades of honour with their lord and pardon and bountiful provision even as thy lord caused thee muhammad to go forth from thy home with the truth and lo party of the believers were averse to it disputing with thee of the truth after it had been made manifest as if they were being driven to death visible and when allah promised you one of the two bands of the enemy that it should be yours and ye longed that other than the armed one might be yours and allah willed that he should cause the truth to triumph by his words and cut the root of the disbelievers that he might cause the truth to triumph and bring vanity to naught however much the guilty might oppose when ye sought help of your lord and he answered you saying will help you with thousand of the angels rank on rank allah appointed it only as good tidings and that your hearts thereby might be at rest victory cometh only by the help of allah lo allah is mighty wise when he made the slumber fall upon you as reassurance from him and sent down water from the sky upon you that thereby he might purify you and remove from you the fear of satan and make strong your hearts and firm your feet thereby when thy lord inspired the angels saying am with you so make those who believe stand firm will throw fear into the hearts of those who disbelieve then smite the necks and smite of them each finger that is because they opposed allah and his messenger whoso opposeth allah and his messenger for him lo allah is severe in punishment that is the award so taste it and know that for disbelievers is the torment of the fire ye who believe when ye meet those who disbelieve in battle turn not your backs to them whoso on that day turneth his back to them unless manoeuvring for battle or intent to join company he truly hath incurred wrath from allah and his habitation will be hell hapless journey end ye muslims slew them not but allah slew them and thou muhammad threwest not when thou didst throw but allah threw that he might test the believers by fair test from him lo allah is hearer knower that is the case and know that allah it is who maketh weak the plan of disbelievers qureysh if ye sought judgment now hath the judgment come unto you and if ye cease from persecuting the believers it will be better for you but if ye return to the attack we also shall return and your host will avail you naught however numerous it be and know that allah is with the believers in his guidance ye who believe obey allah and his messenger and turn not away from him when ye hear him speak be not as those who say we hear and they hear not lo the worst of beasts in allah sight are the deaf the dumb who have no sense had allah known of any good in them he would have made them hear but had he made them hear they would have turned away averse ye who believe obey allah and the messenger when he calleth you to that which quickeneth you and know that allah cometh in between the man and his own heart and that he it is unto whom ye will be gathered and guard yourselves against chastisement which cannot fall exclusively on those of you who are wrong doers and know that allah is severe in punishment and remember when ye were few and reckoned feeble in the land and were in fear lest men should extirpate you how he gave you refuge and strengthened you with his help and made provision of good things for you that haply ye might be thankful ye who believe betray not allah and his messenger nor knowingly betray your trusts and know that your possessions and your children are test and that with allah is immense reward ye who believe if ye keep your duty to allah he will give you discrimination between right and wrong and will rid you of your evil thoughts and deeds and will forgive you allah is of infinite bounty and when those who disbelieve plot against thee muhammad to wound thee fatally or to kill thee or to drive thee forth they plot but allah also plotteth and allah is the best of plotters and when our revelations are recited unto them they say we have heard if we wish we can speak the like of this lo this is naught but fables of the men of old and when they said allah if this be indeed the truth from thee then rain down stones on us or bring on us some painful doom but allah would not punish them while thou wast with them nor will he punish them while they seek forgiveness what plea have they that allah should not punish them when they debar his servants from the inviolable place of worship though they are not its fitting guardians its fitting guardians are those only who keep their duty to allah but most of them know not and their worship at the holy house is naught but whistling and handclapping therefore it is said unto them taste of the doom because ye disbelieve lo those who disbelieve spend their wealth in order that they may debar men from the way of allah they will spend it then it will become an anguish for them then they will be conquered and those who disbelieve will be gathered unto hell that allah may separate the wicked from the good the wicked will he place piece upon piece and heap them all together and consign them unto hell such verily are the losers tell those who disbelieve that if they cease from persecution of believers that which is past will be forgiven them but if they return thereto then the example of the men of old hath already gone before them for warning and fight them until persecution is no more and religion is all for allah but if they cease then lo allah is seer of what they do and if they turn away then know that allah is your befriender transcendent patron transcendent helper and know that whatever ye take as spoils of war lo fifth thereof is for allah and for the messenger and for the kinsman who hath need and orphans and the needy and the wayfarer if ye believe in allah and that which we revealed unto our slave on the day of discrimination the day when the two armies met and allah is able to do all things when ye were on the near bank of the valley and they were on the yonder bank and the caravan was below you on the coast plain and had ye trysted to meet one another ye surely would have failed to keep the tryst but it happened as it did without the forethought of either of you that allah might conclude thing that must be done that he who perished on that day might perish by clear proof of his sovereignty and he who survived might survive by clear proof of his sovereignty lo allah in truth is hearer knower when allah showed them unto thee muhammad in thy dream as few in number and if he had shown them to thee as many ye muslims would have faltered and would have quarrelled over the affair but allah saved you lo he knoweth what is in the breasts of men and when he made you muslims when ye met them see them with your eyes as few and lessened you in their eyes it was that allah might conclude thing that must be done unto allah all things are brought back ye who believe when ye meet an army hold firm and think of allah much that ye may be successful and obey allah and his messenger and dispute not one with another lest ye falter and your strength depart from you but be steadfast lo allah is with the steadfast be not as those who came forth from their dwellings boastfully and to be seen of men and debar men from the way of allah while allah is surrounding all they do and when satan made their deeds seem fair to them and said no one of mankind can conquer you this day for am your protector but when the armies came in sight of one another he took flight saying lo am guiltless of you lo see that which ye see not lo fear allah and allah is severe in punishment when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease said their religion hath deluded these whoso putteth his trust in allah will find that lo allah is mighty wise if thou couldst see how the angels receive those who disbelieve smiting faces and their backs and saying taste the punishment of burning this is for that which your own hands have sent before to the judgment and know that allah is not tyrant to his slaves their way is as the way of pharaoh folk and those before them they disbelieved the revelations of allah and allah took them in their sins lo allah is strong severe in punishment that is because allah never changeth the grace he hath bestowed on any people until they first change that which is in their hearts and that is because allah is hearer knower their way is as the way of pharaoh folk and those before them they denied the revelations of their lord so we destroyed them in their sins and we drowned the folk of pharaoh all were evil doers lo the worst of beasts in allah sight are the ungrateful who will not believe those of them with whom thou madest treaty and then at every opportunity they break their treaty and they keep not duty to allah if thou comest on them in the war deal with them so as to strike fear in those who are behind them that haply they may remember and if thou fearest treachery from any folk then throw back to them their treaty fairly lo allah loveth not the treacherous and let not those who disbelieve suppose that they can outstrip allah purpose lo they cannot escape make ready for them all thou canst of armed force and of horses tethered that thereby ye may dismay the enemy of allah and your enemy and others beside them whom ye know not allah knoweth them whatsoever ye spend in the way of allah it will be repaid to you in full and ye will not be wronged and if they incline to peace incline thou also to it and trust in allah lo he even he is the hearer the knower and if they would deceive thee then lo allah is sufficient for thee he it is who supporteth thee with his help and with the believers and as for the believers hath attuned their hearts if thou hadst spent all that is in the earth thou couldst not have attuned their hearts but allah hath attuned them lo he is mighty wise prophet allah is sufficient for thee and those who follow thee of the believers prophet exhort the believers to fight if there be of you twenty steadfast they shall overcome two hundred and if there be of you hundred steadfast they shall overcome thousand of those who disbelieve because they the disbelievers are folk without intelligence now hath allah lightened your burden for he knoweth that there is weakness in you so if there be of you steadfast hundred they shall overcome two hundred and if there be of you thousand steadfast they shall overcome two thousand by permission of allah allah is with the steadfast it is not for any prophet to have captives until he hath made slaughter in the land ye desire the lure of this world and allah desireth for you the hereafter and allah is mighty wise had it not been for an ordinance of allah which had gone before an awful doom had come upon you on account of what ye took now enjoy what ye have won as lawful and good and keep your duty to allah lo allah is forgiving merciful prophet say unto those captives who are in your hands if allah knoweth any good in your hearts he will give you better than that which hath been taken from you and will forgive you lo allah is forgiving merciful and if they would betray thee they betrayed allah before and he gave thee power over them allah is knower wise lo those who believed and left their homes and strove with their wealth and their lives for the cause of allah and those who took them in and helped them these are protecting friends one of another and those who believed but did not leave their homes ye have no duty to protect them till they leave their homes but if they seek help from you in the matter of religion then it is your duty to help them except against folk between whom and you there is treaty allah is seer of what ye do and those who disbelieve are protectors one of another if ye do not so there will be confusion in the land and great corruption those who believed and left their homes and strove for the cause of allah and those who took them in and helped them these are the believers in truth for them is pardon and bountiful provision and those who afterwards believed and left their homes and strove along with you they are of you and those who are akin are nearer one to another in the ordinance of allah lo allah is knower of all things sura at tawba repentance dispensation freedom from obligation is proclaimed from allah and his messenger toward those of the idolaters with whom ye made treaty travel freely in the land four months and know that ye cannot escape allah and that allah will confound the disbelievers in his guidance and proclamation from allah and his messenger to all men on the day of the greater pilgrimage that allah is free from obligation to the idolaters and so is his messenger so if ye repent it will be better for you but if ye are averse then know that ye cannot escape allah give tidings muhammad of painful doom to those who disbelieve excepting those of the idolaters with whom ye muslims have treaty and who have since abated nothing of your right nor have supported anyone against you as for these fulfil their treaty to them till their term lo allah loveth those who keep their duty unto him then when the sacred months have passed slay the idolaters wherever ye find them and take them captive and besiege them and prepare for them each ambush but if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor due then leave their way free lo allah is forgiving merciful and if anyone of the idolaters seeketh thy protection muhammad then protect him so that he may hear the word of allah and afterward convey him to his place of safety that is because they are folk who know not how can there be treaty with allah and with his messenger for the idolaters save those with whom ye made treaty at the inviolable place of worship so long as they are true to you be true to them lo allah loveth those who keep their duty how can there be any treaty for the others when if they have the upper hand of you they regard not pact nor honour in respect of you they satisfy you with their mouths the while their hearts refuse and most of them are wrongdoers they have purchased with the revelations of allah little gain so they debar men from his way lo evil is that which they are wont to do and they observe toward believer neither pact nor honour these are they who are transgressors but if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor due then are they your brethren in religion we detail our revelations for people who have knowledge and if they break their pledges after their treaty hath been made with you and assail your religion then fight the heads of disbelief lo they have no binding oaths in order that they may desist will ye not fight folk who broke their solemn pledges and purposed to drive out the messenger and did attack you first what fear ye them now allah hath more right that ye should fear him if ye are believers fight them allah will chastise them at your hands and he will lay them low and give you victory over them and he will heal the breasts of folk who are believers and he will remove the anger of their hearts allah relenteth toward whom he will allah is knower wise or deemed ye that ye would be left in peace when allah yet knoweth not those of you who strive choosing for familiar none save allah and his messenger and the believers allah is informed of what ye do it is not for the idolaters to tend allah sanctuaries bearing witness against themselves of disbelief as for such their works are vain and in the fire they will abide he only shall tend allah sanctuaries who believeth in allah and the last day and observeth proper worship and payeth the poor due and feareth none save allah for such only is it possible that they can be of the rightly guided count ye the slaking of pilgrim thirst and tendance of the inviolable place of worship as equal to the worth of him who believeth in allah and the last day and striveth in the way of allah they are not equal in the sight of allah allah guideth not wrongdoing folk those who believe and have left their homes and striven with their wealth and their lives in allah way are of much greater worth in allah sight these are they who are triumphant their lord giveth them good tidings of mercy from him and acceptance and gardens where enduring pleasure will be theirs there they will abide for ever lo with allah there is immense reward ye who believe choose not your fathers nor your brethren for friends if they take pleasure in disbelief rather than faith whoso of you taketh them for friends such are wrong doers say if your fathers and your sons and your brethren and your wives and your tribe and the wealth ye have acquired and merchandise for which ye fear that there will no sale and dwellings ye desire are dearer to you than allah and his messenger and striving in his way then wait till allah bringeth his command to pass allah guideth not wrongdoing folk allah hath given you victory on many fields and on the day of huneyn when ye exulted in your multitude but it availed you naught and the earth vast as it is was straitened for you then ye turned back in flight then allah sent his peace of reassurance down upon his messenger and upon the believers and sent down hosts ye could not see and punished those who disbelieved such is the reward of disbelievers then afterward allah will relent toward whom he will for allah is forgiving merciful ye who believe the idolaters only are unclean so let them not come near the inviolable place of worship after this their year if ye fear poverty from the loss of their merchandise allah shall preserve you of his bounty if he will lo allah is knower wise fight against such of those who have been given the scripture as believe not in allah nor the last day and forbid not that which allah hath forbidden by his messenger and follow not the religion of truth until they pay the tribute readily being brought low and messiah imitate against the jews say ezra is the son of allah and the christians say the is the son of allah that is their saying with their mouths they the saying of those who disbelieved of old allah himself fighteth them how perverse are they they have taken as lords beside allah their rabbis and their monks and the messiah son of mary when they were bidden to worship only one allah there is no allah save him be he glorified from all that they ascribe as partner unto him fain would they put out the light of allah with their mouths but allah disdaineth aught save that he shall perfect his light however much the disbelievers are averse he it is who hath sent his messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth that he may cause it to prevail over all religion however much the idolaters may be averse ye who believe lo many of the jewish rabbis and the christian monks devour the wealth of mankind wantonly and debar men from the way of allah they who hoard up gold and silver and spend it not in the way of allah unto them give tidings muhammad of painful doom on the day when it will all be heated in the fire of hell and their foreheads and their flanks and their backs will be branded therewith and it will be said unto them here is that which ye hoarded for yourselves now taste of what ye used to hoard lo the number of the months with allah is twelve months by allah ordinance in the day that he created the heavens and the earth four of them are sacred that is the right religion so wrong not yourselves in them and wage war on all of the idolaters as they are waging war on all of you and know that allah is with those who keep their duty unto him postponement of sacred month is only an excess of disbelief whereby those who disbelieve are misled they allow it one year and forbid it another year that they may make up the number of the months which allah hath hallowed so that they allow that which allah hath forbidden the evil of their deeds is made fairseeming unto them allah guideth not the disbelieving folk ye who believe what aileth you that when it is said unto you go forth in the way of allah ye are bowed down to the ground with heaviness take ye pleasure in the life of the world rather than in the hereafter the comfort of the life of the world is but little in the hereafter if ye go not forth he will afflict you with painful doom and will choose instead of you folk other than you ye cannot harm him at all allah is able to do all things if ye help him not still allah helped him when those who disbelieve drove him forth the second of two when they two were in the cave when he said unto his comrade grieve not lo allah is with us then allah caused his peace of reassurance to descend upon him and supported him with hosts ye cannot see and made the word of those who disbelieved the nethermost while allah word it was that became the uppermost allah is mighty wise go forth light armed and heavy armed and strive with your wealth and your lives in the way of allah that is best for you if ye but knew had it been near adventure and an easy journey they had followed thee but the distance seemed too far for them yet will they swear by allah saying if we had been able we would surely have set out with you they destroy their souls and allah knoweth that they verily are liars allah forgive thee muhammad wherefor didst thou grant them leave ere those who told the truth were manifest to thee and thou didst know the liars those who believe in allah and the last day ask no leave of thee lest they should strive with their wealth and their lives allah is aware of those who keep their duty unto him they alone ask leave of thee who believe not in allah and the last day and whose hearts feel doubt so in their doubt they waver and if they had wished to go forth they would assuredly have made ready some equipment but allah was averse to their being sent forth and held them back and it was said unto them sit ye with the sedentary had they gone forth among you they had added to you naught save trouble and had hurried to and fro among you seeking to cause sedition among you and among you there are some who would have listened to them allah is aware of evildoers aforetime they sought to cause sedition and raised difficulties for thee till the truth came and the decree of allah was made manifest though they were loth of them is he who saith grant me leave to stay at home and tempt me not surely it is into temptation that they thus have fallen lo hell verily is all around the disbelievers if good befalleth thee muhammad it afflicteth them and if calamity befalleth thee they say we took precaution and they turn away well pleased say naught befalleth us save that which allah hath decreed for us he is our protecting friend in allah let believers put their trust say can ye await for us aught save one of two good things death or victory in allah way while we await for you that allah will afflict you with doom from him or at our hands await then lo we are awaiting with you say pay your contribution willingly or unwillingly it will not be accepted from you lo ye were ever froward folk and naught preventeth that their contributions should be accepted from them save that they have disbelieved in allah and in his messenger and they come not to worship save as idlers and pay not their contribution save reluctantly so let not their riches nor their children please thee muhammad allah thereby intendeth but to punish them in the life of the world and that their souls shall pass away while they are disbelievers and they swear by allah that they are in truth of you when they are not of you but they are folk who are afraid had they but found refuge or caverns or place to enter they surely had resorted thither swift as runaways and of them is he who defameth thee in the matter of the alms if they are given thereof they are content and if they are not given thereof behold they are enraged how much more seemly had they been content with that which allah and his messenger had given them and had said allah sufficeth us allah will give us of his bounty and also his messenger unto allah we are suppliants the alms are only for the poor and the needy and those who collect them and those whose hearts are to be reconciled and to free the captives and the debtors and for the cause of allah and for the wayfarer duty imposed by allah allah is knower wise and of them are those who vex the prophet and say he is only hearer say hearer of good for you who believeth in allah and is true to the believers and mercy for such of you as believe those who vex the messenger of allah for them there is painful doom they swear by allah to you muslims to please you but allah with his messenger hath more right that they should please him if they are believers know they not that whoso opposeth allah and his messenger his verily is fire of hell to abide therein that is the extreme abasement the hypocrites fear lest surah should be revealed concerning them proclaiming what is in their hearts say scoff your fill lo allah is disclosing what ye fear and if thou ask them muhammad they will say we did but talk and jest say was it at allah and his revelations and his messenger that ye did scoff make no excuse ye have disbelieved after your confession of belief if we forgive party of you party of you we shall punish because they have been guilty the hypocrites both men and women proceed one from another they enjoin the wrong and they forbid the right and they withhold their hands from spending for the cause of allah they forget allah so he hath forgotten them lo the hypocrites they are the transgressors allah promiseth the hypocrites both men and women and the disbelievers fire of hell for their abode it will suffice them allah curseth them and theirs is lasting torment even as those before you who were mightier than you in strength and more affluent than you in wealth and children they enjoyed their lot awhile so ye enjoy your lot awhile even as those before you did enjoy their lot awhile and ye prate even as they prated such are they whose works have perished in the world and the hereafter such are they who are the losers hath not the fame of those before them reached them the folk of noah ad thamud the folk of abraham the dwellers of midian and the disasters which befell them their messengers from allah came unto them with proofs of allah sovereignty so allah surely wronged them not but they did wrong themselves and the believers men and women are protecting friends one of another they enjoin the right and forbid the wrong and they establish worship and they pay the poor due and they obey allah and his messenger as for these allah will have mercy on them lo allah is mighty wise allah promiseth to the believers men and women gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide blessed dwellings in gardens of eden and greater far acceptance from allah that is the supreme triumph prophet strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites be harsh with them their ultimate abode is hell hapless journey end they swear by allah that they said nothing wrong yet they did say the word of disbelief and did disbelieve after their surrender to allah and they purposed that which they could not attain and they sought revenge only that allah by his messenger should enrich them of his bounty if they repent it will be better for them and if they turn away allah will afflict them with painful doom in the world and the hereafter and they have no protecting friend nor helper in the earth and of them is he who made covenant with allah saying if he give us of his bounty we will give alms and become of the righteous yet when he gave them of his bounty they hoarded it and turned away averse so he hath made the consequence to be hypocrisy in their hearts until the day when they shall meet him because they broke their word to allah that they promised him and because they lied know they not that allah knoweth both their secret and the thought that they confide and that allah is the knower of things hidden those who point at such of the believers as give the alms willingly and such as can find naught to give but their endeavours and deride them allah himself derideth them theirs will be painful doom ask forgiveness for them muhammad or ask not forgiveness for them though thou ask forgiveness for them seventy times allah will not forgive them that is because they disbelieved in allah and his messenger and allah guideth not wrongdoing folk those who were left behind rejoiced at sitting still behind the messenger of allah and were averse to striving with their wealth and their lives in allah way and they said go not forth in the heat say the fire of hell is more intense of heat if they but understood then let them laugh little they will weep much as the reward of what they used to earn if allah bring thee back from the campaign unto party of them and they ask of thee leave to go out to fight then say unto them ye shall never more go out with me nor fight with me against foe ye were content with sitting still the first time so sit still with the useless and never muhammad pray for one of them who dieth nor stand by his grave lo they disbelieved in allah and his messenger and they died while they were evil doers let not their wealth nor their children please thee allah purposeth only to punish them thereby in the world and that their souls shall pass away while they are disbelievers and when surah is revealed which saith believe in allah and strive along with his messenger the men of wealth among them still ask leave of thee and say suffer us to be with those who sit at home they are content that they should be with the useless and their hearts are sealed so that they apprehend not but the messenger and those who believe with him strive with their wealth and their lives such are they for whom are the good things such are they who are the successful allah hath made ready for them gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide that is the supreme triumph and those among the wandering arabs who had an excuse came in order that permission might be granted them and those who lied to allah and his messenger sat at home painful doom will fall on those of them who disbelieve not unto the weak nor unto the sick nor unto those who can find naught to spend is any fault to be imputed though they stay at home if they are true to allah and his messenger not unto the good is there any road of blame allah is forgiving merciful nor unto those whom when they came to thee asking that thou shouldst mount them thou didst tell cannot find whereon to mount you they turned back with eyes flowing with tears for sorrow that they could not find the means to spend the road of blame is only against those who ask for leave of thee to stay at home when they are rich they are content to be with the useless allah hath sealed their hearts so that they know not they will make excuse to you muslims when ye return unto them say make no excuse for we shall not believe you allah hath told us tidings of you allah and his messenger will see your conduct and then ye will be brought back unto him who knoweth the invisible as well as the visible and he will tell you what ye used to do they will swear by allah unto you when ye return unto them that ye may let them be let them be for lo they are unclean and their abode is hell as the reward for what they used to earn they swear unto you that ye may accept them though ye accept them allah verily accepteth not wrongdoing folk the wandering arabs are more hard in disbelief and hypocrisy and more likely to be ignorant of the limits which allah hath revealed unto his messenger and allah is knower wise and of the wandering arabs there is he who taketh that which he expendeth for the cause of allah as loss and awaiteth evil turns of fortune for you that he may be rid of it the evil turn of fortune will be theirs allah is hearer knower and of the wandering arabs there is he who believeth in allah and the last day and taketh that which he expendeth and also the prayers of the messenger as acceptable offerings in the sight of allah lo verily it is an acceptable offering for them allah will bring them into his mercy lo allah is forgiving merciful and the who followed well pleased rivers flow first to lead the way of the muhajirin and the ansar and those them in goodness allah is well pleased with them and they are with him and he hath made ready for them gardens underneath which wherein they will abide for ever that is the supreme triumph and among those around you of the wandering arabs there are hypocrites and among the townspeople of al madinah there are some who persist in hypocrisy whom thou muhammad knowest not we we know them and we shall chastise them twice then they will be relegated to painful doom and there are others who have acknowledged their faults they mixed righteous action with another that was bad it may be that allah will relent toward them lo allah is forgiving merciful take alms of their wealth wherewith thou mayst purify them and mayst make them grow and pray for them lo thy prayer is an assuagement for them allah is hearer knower know they not that allah is he who accepteth repentance from his bondmen and taketh the alms and that allah is he who is the relenting the merciful and say unto them act allah will behold your actions and so will his messenger and the believers and ye will be brought back to the knower of the invisible and the visible and he will tell you what ye used to do and there are others who await allah decree whether he will punish them or will forgive them allah is knower wise and as for those who chose place of worship out of opposition disbelief and in order to cause dissent among the believers and as for those who warred against allah and his messenger aforetime they swear we purposed naught save good allah beareth witness that they liars and an outpost will surely verily are never stand to pray there place of worship which was found upon duty to allah from the first day is more worthy that thou shouldst stand to pray therein wherein are men who love to purify themselves allah loveth the purifiers is he who founded his building upon duty to allah and his good pleasure better or he who founded his building on the brink of crumbling overhanging precipice so that it toppled with him into the fire of hell allah guideth not wrongdoing folk the building which they built will never cease to be misgiving in their hearts unless their hearts be torn to pieces allah is knower wise lo allah hath bought from the believers their lives and their wealth because the garden will be theirs they shall fight in the way of allah and shall slay and be slain it is promise which is binding on him in the torah and the gospel and the qur an who fulfilleth his covenant better than allah rejoice then in your bargain that ye have made for that is the supreme triumph triumphant are those who turn repentant to allah those who serve him those who praise him those who fast those who bow down those who fall prostrate in worship those who enjoin the right and who forbid the wrong and those who keep the limits ordained of allah and give glad tidings to believers it is not for the prophet and those who believe to pray for the forgiveness of idolaters even though they may be near of kin to them after it hath become clear that they are people of hell fire the prayer of abraham for the forgiveness of his father was only because of promise he had promised him but when it had become clear unto him that he his father was an enemy to allah he abraham disowned him lo abraham was soft of heart long suffering it was never allah part that he should send folk astray after he had guided them until he had made clear unto them what they should avoid lo allah is aware of all things lo allah unto him belongeth the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth he quickeneth and he giveth death and ye have instead of allah no protecting friend nor helper allah hath turned in mercy to the prophet and to the muhajirin and the ansar who followed him in the hour of hardship after the hearts of party of them had almost swerved aside then turned he unto them in mercy lo he is full of pity merciful for them and to the three also did he turn in mercy who were left behind when the earth vast as it is was straitened for them and their own souls were straitened for them till they bethought them that there is no refuge from allah save toward him then turned he unto them in mercy that they too might turn repentant unto him lo allah he is the relenting the merciful ye who believe be careful of your duty to allah and be with the truthful it is not for the townsfolk of al madinah and for those around them of the wandering arabs so stay behind the messenger of allah and prefer their lives to his life that is because neither thirst nor toil nor hunger afflicteth them in the way of allah nor step they any step that angereth the disbelievers nor gain they from the enemy gain but good deed is recorded for them therefor lo allah loseth not the wages of the good nor spend they any spending small or great nor do they cross valley but it is recorded for them that allah may repay them the best of what they used to do and the believers should not all go out to fight of every troop of them party only should go forth that they who are left behind may gain sound knowledge in religion and that they may warn their folk when they return to them so that they may beware ye who believe fight those of the disbelievers who are near to you and let them find harshness in you and know that allah is with those who keep their duty unto him and whenever surah is revealed there are some of them who say which one of you hath thus increased in faith as for those who believe it hath increased them in faith and they rejoice therefor but as for those in whose hearts is disease it only addeth wickedness to their wickedness and they die while they are disbelievers see they not that they are tested once or twice in every year still they turn not in repentance neither pay they heed and whenever surah is revealed they look one at another as who should say doth anybody see you then they turn away allah turneth away their hearts because they are folk who understand not there hath come unto you messenger one of yourselves unto whom aught that ye are overburdened is grievous full of concern for you for the believers full of pity merciful now if they turn away muhammad say allah sufficeth me there is no allah save him in him have put my trust and he is lord of the tremendous throne sura yunus jonah alif lam ra these are verses of the wise scripture is it wonder for mankind that we have inspired man among them saying warn mankind and bring unto those who believe the good tidings that they have sure footing with their lord the disbelievers say lo this is mere wizard lo your lord is allah who created the heavens and the earth in six days then he established himself upon the throne directing all things there is no intercessor with him save after his permission that is allah your lord so worship him oh will ye not remind unto him is the return of all of you it is promise of allah in truth lo he produceth creation then reproduceth it that he may reward those who believe and do good works with equity while as for those who disbelieve theirs will be boiling drink and painful doom because they disbelieved he it is who appointed the sun splendour and the moon light and measured for her stages that ye might know the number of the years and the reckoning allah created not all that save in truth he detaileth the revelations for people who have knowledge lo in the difference of day and night and all that allah hath created in the heavens and the earth are portents verily for folk who ward off evil lo those who expect not the meeting with us but desire the life of the world and feel secure therein and those who are neglectful of our revelations their home will be the fire because of what they used to earn lo those who believe and do good works their lord guideth them by their faith rivers will flow beneath them in the gardens of delight their prayer therein will be glory be to thee allah and their greeting therein will be peace and the conclusion of their prayer will be praise be to allah lord of the worlds if allah were to hasten on for men the ill that they have earned as they would hasten on the good their respite would already have expired but we suffer those who look not for the meeting with us to wander blindly on in their contumacy and if misfortune touch man he crieth unto us while reclining on his side or sitting or standing but when we have relieved him of the misfortune he goeth his way as though he had not cried unto us because of misfortune that afflicted him thus is what they do made seeming fair unto the prodigal we destroyed the generations before you when they did wrong and their messengers from allah came unto them with clear proofs of his sovereignty but they would not believe thus do we reward the guilty folk then we appointed you viceroys in the earth after them that we might see how ye behave and when our clear revelations are recited unto them they who look not for the meeting with us say bring lecture other than this or change it say muhammad it is not for me to change it of my accord only follow that which is inspired in me lo if disobey my lord fear the retribution of an awful day say if allah had so willed should not have recited it to you nor would he have made it known to you dwelt among you whole lifetime before it came to me have ye then no sense who doeth greater wrong than he who inventeth lie concerning allah and denieth his revelations lo the guilty never are successful they worship beside allah that which neither hurteth them nor profiteth them and they say these are our intercessors with allah say would ye inform allah of something that he knoweth not in the heavens or in the earth praised be he and high exalted above all that ye associate with him mankind were but one community then they differed and had it not been for word that had already gone forth from thy lord it had been judged between them in respect of that wherein they differ and they will say if only portent were sent down upon him from his lord then say muhammad the unseen belongeth to allah so wait lo am waiting with you and when we cause mankind to taste of mercy after some adversity which had afflicted them behold they have some plot against our revelations say allah is more swift in plotting lo our messengers write down that which ye plot he it is who maketh you to go on the land and the sea till when ye are in the ships and they sail with them with fair breeze and they are glad therein storm wind reacheth them and the wave cometh unto them from every side and they deem that they are overwhelmed therein then they cry unto allah making their faith pure for him only if thou deliver us from this we truly will be of the thankful yet when he hath delivered them behold they rebel in the earth wrongfully mankind your rebellion is only against yourselves ye have enjoyment of the life of the world then unto us is your return and we shall proclaim unto you what ye used to do the similitude of the life of the world is only as water which we send down from the sky then the earth growth of that which men and cattle eat mingleth with it till when the earth hath taken on her ornaments and is embellished and her people deem that they are masters of her our commandment cometh by night or by day and we make it as reaped corn as if it had not flourished yesterday thus do we expound the revelations for people who reflect and allah summoneth to the abode of peace and leadeth whom he will to straight path for those who do good is the best reward and more thereto neither dust nor ignominy cometh near their faces such are rightful owners of the garden they will abide therein and those who earn ill deeds for them requital of each ill deed by the like thereof and ignominy overtaketh them they have no protector from allah as if their faces had been covered with cloak of darkest night such are rightful owners of the fire they will abide therein on the day when we gather them all together then we say unto those who ascribed partners unto us stand back ye and your pretended partners of allah and we separate them the one from the other and their pretended partners say it was not us ye worshipped allah sufficeth as witness between us and you that we were unaware of your worship there doth every soul experience that which it did aforetime and they are returned unto allah their rightful lord and that which they used to invent hath failed them say unto them muhammad who provideth for you from the sky and the earth or who owneth hearing and sight and who bringeth forth the living from the dead and bringeth forth the dead from the living and who directeth the course they will say allah then say will ye not then keep your duty unto him such then is allah your rightful lord after the truth what is there saving error how then are ye turned away thus is the word of thy lord justified concerning those who do wrong that they believe not say is there of your partners whom ye ascribe unto allah one that produceth creation and then reproduceth it say allah produceth creation then reproduceth it how then are ye misled say is there of your partners whom ye ascribe unto allah one that leadeth to the truth say allah leadeth to the truth is he who leadeth to the truth more deserving that he should be followed or he who findeth not the way unless he himself be guided what aileth you how judge ye most of them follow not but conjecture assuredly conjecture can by no means take the place of truth lo allah is aware of what they do and this qur an is not such as could ever be invented in despite of allah but it is confirmation of that which was before it and an exposition of that which is decreed for mankind therein is no doubt from the lord of the worlds or say they he hath invented it say then bring surah like unto it and call for help on all ye can besides allah if ye are truthful nay but they denied that the knowledge whereof they could not compass and whereof the interpretation in events hath not yet come unto them even so did those before them deny then see what was the consequence for the wrong doers and of them is he who believeth therein and of them is he who believeth not therein and thy lord is best aware of the corrupters and if they deny thee say unto me my work and unto you your work ye are innocent of what do and am innocent of what ye do and of them are some who listen unto thee but canst thou make the deaf to hear even though they apprehend not and of them is he who looketh toward thee but canst thou guide the blind even though they see not lo allah wrongeth not mankind in aught but mankind wrong themselves and on the day when he shall gather them together when it will seem as though they had tarried but an hour of the day recognising one another those will verily have perished who denied the meeting with allah and were not guided whether we let thee muhammad behold something of that which we promise them or whether we cause thee to die still unto us is their return and allah moreover is witness over what they do and for every nation there is messenger and when their messenger cometh on the day of judgment it will be judged between them fairly and they will not be wronged and they say when will this promise be fulfilled if ye are truthful say have no power to hurt or benefit myself save that which allah willeth for every nation there is an appointed time when their time cometh then they cannot put it off an hour nor hasten it say have ye thought when his doom cometh unto you as raid by night or in the busy day what is there of it that the guilty ones desire to hasten is it only then when it hath befallen you that ye will believe what believe now when until now ye have been hastening it on through disbelief then will it be said unto those who dealt unjustly taste the torment of eternity are ye requited aught save what ye used to earn and they ask thee to inform them saying is it true say yea by my lord verily it is true and ye cannot escape and if each soul that doeth wrong had all that is in the earth it would seek to ransom itself therewith and they will feel remorse within them when they see the doom but it hath been judged between them fairly and they are not wronged lo verily all that is in the heavens and the earth is allah lo verily allah promise is true but most of them know not he quickeneth and giveth death and unto him ye will be returned mankind there hath come unto you an exhortation from your lord balm for that which is in the breasts guidance and mercy for believers say in the bounty of allah and in his mercy therein let them rejoice it is better than what they hoard say have ye considered what provision allah hath sent down for you how ye have made of it lawful and unlawful hath allah permitted you or do ye invent lie concerning allah and what think those who invent lie concerning allah will be their plight upon the day of resurrection lo allah truly is bountiful toward mankind but most of them give not thanks and thou muhammad art not occupied with any business and thou recitest not lecture from this scripture and ye mankind perform no act but we are witness of you when ye are engaged therein and not an atom weight in the earth or in the sky escapeth your lord nor what is less than that or greater than that but it is written in clear book lo verily the friends of allah are those on whom fear cometh not nor do they grieve those who believe and keep their duty to allah theirs are good tidings in the life of the world and in the hereafter there is no changing the words of allah that is the supreme triumph and let not their speech grieve thee muhammad lo power belongeth wholly to allah he is the hearer the knower lo is it not unto allah that belongeth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is in the earth those who follow aught instead of allah follow not his partners they follow only conjecture and they do but guess he it is who hath appointed for you the night that ye should rest therein and the day giving sight lo herein verily are portents for folk that heed they say allah hath taken unto him son glorified be he he hath no needs his is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth ye have no warrant for this tell ye concerning allah that which ye know not say verily those who invent lie concerning allah will not succeed this world portion will be theirs then unto us is their return then we make them taste dreadful doom because they used to disbelieve recite unto them the story of noah when he told his people my people if my sojourn here and my reminding you by allah revelations are an offence unto you in allah have put my trust so decide upon your course of action you and your partners let not your course of action be in doubt for you then have at me give me no respite but if ye are averse have asked of you no wage my wage is the concern of allah only and am commanded to be of those who surrender unto him but they denied him so we saved him and those with him in the ship and made them viceroys in the earth while we drowned those who denied our revelations see then the nature of the consequence for those who had been warned then after him we sent messengers unto their folk and they brought them clear proofs but they were not ready to believe in that which they before denied thus print we on the hearts of the transgressors then after them we sent moses and aaron unto pharaoh and his chiefs with our revelations but they were arrogant and were guilty folk and when the truth from our presence came unto them they said lo this is mere magic moses said speak ye so of the truth when it hath come unto you is this magic now magicians thrive not they said hast thou come unto us to pervert us from that faith in which we found our fathers and that you two may own the place of greatness in the land we will not believe you two and pharaoh said bring every cunning wizard unto me and when the wizards came moses said unto them cast your cast and when they had cast moses said that which ye have brought is magic lo allah will make it vain lo allah upholdeth not the work of mischief makers and allah will vindicate the truth by his words however much the guilty be averse but none trusted moses save some scions of his people and they were in fear of pharaoh and their chiefs that he would persecute them lo pharaoh was verily tyrant in the land and lo he verily was of the wanton and moses said my people if ye have believed in allah then put trust in him if ye have indeed surrendered unto him they said in allah we put trust our lord oh make us not lure for the wrongdoing folk and of thy mercy save us from the folk that disbelieve and we inspired moses and his brother saying appoint houses for your people in egypt and make your houses oratories and establish worship and give good news to the believers and moses said our lord lo thou hast given pharaoh and his chiefs splendour and riches in the life of the world our lord that they may lead men astray from thy way our lord destroy their riches and harden their hearts so that they believe not till they see the painful doom he said your prayer is heard do ye twain keep to the straight path and follow not the road of those who have no knowledge and we brought the children of israel across the sea and pharaoh with his hosts pursued them in rebellion and transgression till when the fate of drowning overtook him he exclaimed believe that there is no allah save him in whom the children of israel believe and am of those who surrender unto him what now when hitherto thou hast rebelled and been of the wrong doers but this day we save thee in thy body that thou mayst be portent for those after thee lo most of mankind are heedless of our portents and we verily did allot unto the children of israel fixed abode and did provide them with good things and they differed not until the knowledge came unto them lo thy lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ and if thou muhammad art in doubt concerning that which we reveal unto thee then question those who read the scripture that was before thee verily the truth from thy lord hath come unto thee so be not thou of the waverers and be not thou of those who deny the revelations of allah for then wert thou of the losers lo those for whom the word of thy lord concerning sinners hath effect will not believe though every token come unto them till they see the painful doom if only there had been community of all those that were destroyed of old that believed and profited by its belief as did the folk of jonah when they believed we drew off from them the torment of disgrace in the life of the world and gave them comfort for while and if thy lord willed all who are in the earth would have believed together wouldst thou muhammad compel men until they are believers it is not for any soul to believe save by the permission of allah he hath set uncleanness upon those who have no sense say behold what is in the heavens and the earth but revelations and warnings avail not folk who will not believe what expect they save the like of the days of those who passed away before them say expect then am with you among the expectant then shall we save our messengers and the believers in like manner as of old it is incumbent upon us to save believers say muhammad mankind if ye are in doubt of my religion then know that worship not those whom ye worship instead of allah but worship allah who causeth you to die and have been commanded to be of the believers and muhammad set thy purpose resolutely for religion as man by nature upright and be not of those who ascribe partners to allah and cry not beside allah unto that which cannot profit thee nor hurt thee for if thou didst so then wert thou of the wrong doers if allah afflicteth thee with some hurt there is none who can remove it save him and if he desireth good for thee there is none who can repel his bounty he striketh with it whom he will of his bondmen he is the forgiving the merciful say mankind now hath the truth from your lord come unto you so whosoever is guided is guided only for the good of his soul and whosoever erreth erreth only against it and am not warder over you and muhammad follow that which is inspired in thee and forbear until allah give judgment and he is the best of judges sura hud hud alif lam ra this is scripture the revelations whereof are perfected and then expounded it cometh from one wise informed saying serve none but allah lo am unto you from him warner and bringer of good tidings and bidding you ask pardon of your lord and turn to him repentant he will cause you to enjoy fair estate until time appointed he giveth his bounty unto every bountiful one but if ye turn away lo then fear for you the retribution of an awful day unto allah is your return and he is able to do all things lo now they fold up him at the very moment knoweth that which they aware of what is in the their breasts that they may hide their thoughts from when they cover themselves with their clothing allah keep hidden and that which they proclaim lo he is breasts of men and there is not beast in the earth but the sustenance thereof dependeth on allah he knoweth its habitation and its repository all is in clear record and he it is who created the heavens and the earth in six days and his throne was upon the water that he might try you which of you is best in conduct yet if thou muhammad sayest lo ye will be raised again after death those who disbelieve will surely say this is naught but mere magic and if we delay for them the doom until reckoned time they will surely say what withholdeth it verily on the day when it cometh unto them it cannot be averted from them and that which they derided will surround them and if we cause man to taste some mercy from us and afterward withdraw it from him lo he is despairing thankless and if we cause him to taste grace after some misfortune that had befallen him he saith the ills have gone from me lo he is exultant boastful save those who persevere and do good works theirs will be forgiveness and great reward likely thing that thou wouldst forsake aught of that which hath been revealed unto thee and that thy breast should be straitened for it because they say why hath not treasure been sent down for him or an angel come with him thou art but warner and allah is in charge of all things or they say he hath invented it say then bring ten surahs the like thereof invented and call on everyone ye can beside allah if ye are truthful and if they answer not your prayer then know that it is revealed only in the knowledge of allah and that there is no allah save him will ye then be of those who surrender whoso desireth the life of the world and its pomp we shall repay them their deeds herein and therein they will not be wronged those are they for whom is naught in the hereafter save the fire all that they contrive here is vain and all that they are wont to do is fruitless is he to be counted equal with them who relieth on clear proof from his lord and witness from him reciteth it and before it was the book of moses an example and mercy such believe therein and whoso disbelieveth therein of the clans the fire is his appointed place so be not thou in doubt concerning it lo it is the truth from thy lord but most of mankind believe not who doeth greater wrong than he who inventeth lie concerning allah such will be brought before their lord and the witnesses will say these are they who lied concerning their lord now the curse of allah is upon wrong doers who debar men from the way of allah and would have it crooked and who are disbelievers in the hereafter such will not escape in the earth nor have they any protecting friends beside allah for them the torment will be double they could not bear to hear and they used not to see such are they who have lost their souls and that which they used to invent hath failed them assuredly in the hereafter they will be the greatest losers lo those who believe and do good works and humble themselves before their lord such are rightful owners of the garden they will abide therein the similitude of the two parties is as the blind and the deaf and the seer and the hearer are they equal in similitude will ye not then be admonished and we sent noah unto his folk and he said lo am plain warner unto you that ye serve none save allah lo fear for you the retribution of painful day the chieftains of his folk who disbelieved said we see thee but mortal like us and we see not that any follow thee save the most abject among us without reflection we behold in you no merit above us nay we deem you liars he said my people bethink you if rely on clear proof from my lord and there hath come unto me mercy from his presence and it hath been made obscure to you can we compel you to accept it when ye are averse thereto and my people ask of you no wealth therefor my reward is the concern only of allah and am not going to thrust away those who believe lo they have to meet their lord but see you folk that are ignorant and my people who would deliver me from allah if thrust them away will ye not then reflect say not unto you have the treasures of allah nor have knowledge of the unseen nor say lo am an angel nor say unto those whom your eyes scorn that allah will not give them good allah knoweth best what is in their hearts lo then indeed should be of the wrong doers they said noah thou hast disputed with us and multiplied disputation with us now bring upon us that wherewith thou threatenest us if thou art of the truthful he said only allah will bring it upon you if he will and ye can by no means escape my counsel will not profit you if were minded to advise you if allah will is to keep you astray he is your lord and unto him ye will be brought back or say they again he hath invented it say if have invented it upon me be my crimes but am innocent of all that ye commit and it was inspired in noah saying no one of thy folk will believe save him who hath believed already be not distressed because of what they do build the ship under our eyes and by our inspiration and speak not unto me on behalf of those who do wrong lo they will be drowned and he was building the ship and every time that chieftains of his people passed him they made mock of him he said though ye make mock of us yet we mock at you even as ye mock and ye shall know to whom punishment that will confound him cometh and upon whom lasting doom will fall thus it forth water female and already and was till when our commandment came to pass and the oven gushed we said load therein two of every kind pair the male and thy household save him against whom the word hath gone forth those who believe and but few were they who believed with him and he said embark therein in the name of allah be its course and its mooring lo my lord is forgiving merciful and it sailed with them amid waves like mountains and noah cried unto his son and he was standing aloof my son come ride with us and be not with the disbelievers he said shall betake me to some mountain that will save me from the water noah said this day there is none that saveth from the commandment of allah save him on whom he hath had mercy and the wave came in between them so he was among the drowned and it was said earth swallow thy water and sky be cleared of clouds and the water was made to subside and the commandment was fulfilled and it the ship came to rest upon the mount al judi and it was said far removal for wrongdoing folk and noah cried unto his lord and said my lord lo my son is of my household surely thy promise is the truth and thou are the most just of judges he said noah lo he is not of thy household lo he is of evil conduct so ask not of me that whereof thou hast no knowledge admonish thee lest thou be among the ignorant he said my lord lo in thee do seek refuge from the sin that should ask of thee that whereof have no knowledge unless thou forgive me and have mercy on me shall be among the lost it was said unto him noah go thou down from the mountain with peace from us and blessings upon thee and some nations that will spring from those with thee there will be other nations unto whom we shall give enjoyment long while and then painful doom from us will overtake them this is of the tidings of the unseen which we inspire in thee muhammad thou thyself knewest it not nor did thy folk know it before this then have patience lo the sequel is for those who ward off evil and unto the tribe of ad we sent their brother hud he said my people serve allah ye have no other allah save him lo ye do but invent my people ask of you no reward for it lo my reward is the concern only of him who made me have ye then no sense and my people ask forgiveness of your lord then turn unto him repentant he will cause the sky to rain abundance on you and will add unto you strength to your strength turn not away guilty they said hud thou hast brought us no clear proof and we are not going to forsake our gods on thy mere saying and we are not believers in thee we say naught save that one of our gods hath possessed thee in an evil way he said call allah to witness and do ye too bear witness that am innocent of all that ye ascribe as partners to allah beside him so try to circumvent me all of you give me no respite lo have put my trust in allah my lord and your lord not an animal but he doth grasp it by the forelock lo my lord is on straight path and if ye turn away still have conveyed unto you that wherewith was sent unto you and my lord will set in place of you folk other than you ye cannot injure him at all lo my lord is guardian over all things and when our commandment came to pass we saved hud and those who believed with him by mercy from us we saved them from harsh doom and such were ad they denied the revelations of their lord and flouted his messengers and followed the command of every froward potentate and curse was made to follow them in the world and on the day of resurrection lo ad disbelieved in their lord far removal for ad the folk of hud and unto the tribe of thamud we sent their brother salih he said my people serve allah ye have no other allah save him he brought you forth from the earth and hath made you husband it so ask forgiveness of him and turn unto him repentant lo my lord is nigh responsive they said salih thou hast been among us hitherto as that wherein our hope was placed dost thou ask us not to worship what our fathers worshipped lo we verily are in grave doubt concerning that to which thou callest us he said my people bethink you if am acting on clear proof from my lord and there hath come unto me mercy from him who will save me from allah if disobey him ye would add to me naught save perdition my people this is the camel of allah token unto you so suffer her to feed in allah earth and touch her not with harm lest near torment seize you but they hamstrung her and then he said enjoy life in your dwelling place three days this is threat that will not be belied so when our commandment came to pass we saved salih and those who believed with him by mercy from us from the ignominy of that day lo thy lord he is the strong the mighty and the awful cry overtook those who did wrong so that morning found them prostrate in their dwellings as though they had not dwelt there lo thamud disbelieved in their lord far removal for thamud and our messengers cam unto abraham with good news they said peace he answered peace and delayed not to bring roasted calf and when he saw their hands reached not to it he mistrusted them and conceived fear of them they said fear not lo we are sent unto the folk of lot and his wife standing by laughed when we gave her good tidings of the birth of isaac and after isaac of jacob she said oh woe is me shall bear child when am an old woman and this my husband is an old man lo this is strange thing they said wonderest thou at the commandment of allah the mercy of allah and his blessings be upon you people of the house lo he is owner of praise owner of glory and when the awe departed from abraham and the glad news reached him he pleaded with us on behalf of the folk of lot lo abraham was mild imploring penitent it was said abraham forsake this lo thy lord commandment hath gone forth and lo there cometh unto them doom which cannot be repelled and when our messengers came unto lot he was distressed and knew not how to protect them he said this is distressful day and his people came unto him running towards him and before then they used to commit abominations he said my people here are my daughters they are purer for you beware of allah and degrade me not in the person of my guests is there not among you any upright man they said well thou knowest that we have no right to thy daughters and well thou knowest what we want he said would that had strength to resist you or had some strong support among you the messengers said lot lo we are messengers of thy lord they shall not reach thee so travel with thy people in part of the night and let not one of you turn round all save thy wife lo that which smiteth them will smite her also lo their tryst is for the morning is not the morning nigh so when our commandment came to pass we overthrew that township and rained upon it stones of clay one after another marked with fire in the providence of thy lord for the destruction of the wicked and they are never far from the wrong doers and unto midian we sent their brother shu eyb he said my people serve allah ye have no other allah save him and give not short measure and short weight lo see you well to do and lo fear for you the doom of besetting day my people give full measure and full weight in justice and wrong not people in respect of their goods and do not evil in the earth causing corruption that which allah leaveth with you is better for you if ye are believers and am not keeper over you they said shu eyb doth thy way of prayer command thee that we should forsake that which our fathers used to worship or that we should leave off doing what we will with our own property lo thou art the mild the guide to right behaviour he said my people bethink you if am acting on clear proof from my lord and he sustaineth me with fair sustenance from him how can concede aught to you desire not to do behind your backs that which ask you not to do desire naught save reform so far as am able my welfare is only in allah in him trust and unto him turn repentant and my people let not the schism with me cause you to sin so that there befall you that which befell the folk of noah and the folk of hud and the folk of salih and the folk of lot are not far off from you ask pardon of your lord and then turn unto him repentant lo my lord is merciful loving they said shu eyb we understand not much of that thou tellest and lo we do behold thee weak among us but for thy family we should have stoned thee for thou art not strong against us he said my people is my family more to be honoured by you than allah and ye put him behind you neglected lo my lord surroundeth what ye do and my people act according to your power lo too am acting ye will soon know on whom there cometh doom that will abase him and who it is that lieth and watch lo am watcher with you and when our commandment came to pass we saved shu eyb and those who believed with him by mercy from us and the awful cry seized those who did injustice and morning found them prostrate in their dwellings as though they had not dwelt there far removal for midian even as thamud had been removed afar and verily we sent moses with our revelations and clear warrant unto pharaoh and his chiefs but they did follow the command of pharaoh and the command of pharaoh was no right guide he will go before his people on the day of resurrection and will lead them to the fire for watering place ah hapless is the watering place whither they are led curse is made to follow them in the world and on the day of resurrection hapless is the gift that will be given them that is something of the tidings of the townships which were destroyed of old we relate it unto thee muhammad some of them are standing and some already reaped we wronged them not but they did wrong themselves and their gods on whom they call beside allah availed them naught when came thy lord command they added to them naught save ruin even thus is the grasp of thy lord when he graspeth the townships while they are doing wrong lo his grasp is painful very strong lo herein verily there is portent for those who fear the doom of the hereafter that is day unto which mankind will be gathered and that is day that will be witnessed and we defer it only to term already reckoned on the day when it cometh no soul will speak except by his permission some among them will be wretched others glad as for those who will be wretched on that day they will be in the fire sighing and wailing will be their portion therein abiding there so long as the heavens and the earth endure save for that which thy lord willeth lo thy lord is doer of what he will and as for those who will be glad that day they will be in the garden abiding there so long as the heavens and the earth endure save for that which thy lord willeth gift unfailing so be not thou in doubt concerning that which these folk worship they worship only as their fathers worshipped aforetime lo we shall pay them their whole due unabated and we verily gave unto moses the scripture and there was strife thereupon and had it not been for word that had already gone forth from thy lord the case would have been judged between them and lo they are in grave doubt concerning it and lo unto each thy lord will verily repay his works in full lo he is informed of what they do so tread thou the straight path as thou art commanded and those who turn unto allah with thee and transgress not lo he is seer of what ye do and incline not toward those who do wrong lest the fire touch you and ye have no protecting friends against allah and afterward ye would not be helped establish worship at the two ends of the day and in some watches of the night lo good deeds annul ill deeds this is reminder for the mindful and have patience muhammad for lo allah loseth not the wages of the good if only there had been among the generations before you men possessing remnant of good sense to warn their people from corruption in the earth as did few of those whom we saved from them the wrong doers followed that by which they were made sapless and were guilty in truth thy lord destroyed not the townships tyrannously while their folk were doing right and if thy lord had willed he verily would have made mankind one nation yet they cease not differing save him on whom thy lord hath mercy and for that he did create them and the word of thy lord hath been fulfilled verily shall fill hell with the jinn and mankind together and all that we relate unto thee of the story of the messengers is in order that thereby we may make firm thy heart and herein hath come unto thee the truth and an exhortation and reminder for believers and say unto those who believe not act according to your power lo we too are acting and wait lo we too are waiting and allah is the invisible of the heavens and the earth and unto him the whole matter will be returned so worship him and put thy trust in him lo thy lord is not unaware of what ye mortals do sura yusuf joseph alif lam ra these are verse of the scripture that maketh plain lo we have revealed it lecture in arabic that ye may understand we narrate unto thee muhammad the best of narratives in that we have inspired in thee this qur an though aforetime thou wast of the heedless when joseph said unto his father my father lo saw in dream eleven planets and the sun and the moon saw them prostrating themselves unto me he said my dear son tell not thy brethren of thy vision lest they plot plot against thee lo satan is for man an open foe thus thy lord will prefer thee and will teach thee the interpretation of events and will perfect his grace upon thee and upon the family of jacob as he perfected it upon thy forefathers abraham and isaac lo thy lord is knower wise verily in joseph and his brethren are signs of allah sovereignty for the inquiring when they said verily joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we are many though we be lo our father is in plain aberration one said kill joseph or cast him to some other land so that your father favour may be all for you and that ye may afterward be righteous folk one among them said kill not joseph but if ye must be doing fling him into the depth of the pit some caravan will find him they said our father why wilt thou not trust us with joseph when lo we are good friends to him send him with us to morrow that he may enjoy himself and play and lo we shall take good care of him he said lo in truth it saddens me that ye should take him with you and fear less the wolf devour him while ye are heedless of him they said if the wolf should devour him when we are so strong band then surely we should have already perished then when they led him off and were of one mind that they should place him in the depth of the pit we inspired in him thou wilt tell them of this deed of theirs when they know thee not and they came weeping to their father in the evening saying our father we went racing one with another and left joseph by our things and the wolf devoured him and thou believest not our saying even when we speak the truth and they came with false blood on his shirt he said nay but your minds have beguiled you into something my course is comely patience and allah it is whose help is to be sought in that predicament which ye describe and there came caravan and they sent their waterdrawer he let down his pail into the pit he said good luck here is youth and they hid him as treasure and allah was aware of what they did and they sold him for low price number of silver coins and they attached no value to him and he of egypt who purchased him said unto his wife receive him honourably perchance he may prove useful to us or we may adopt him as son thus we established joseph in the land that we might teach him the interpretation of events and allah was predominant in his career but most of mankind know not and and when he reached his prime we gave him wisdom and knowledge thus we reward the good and she in whose house he was asked of him an evil act she bolted the doors and said come he said seek refuge in allah lo he is my lord who hath treated me honourably lo wrong doers never prosper she verily desired him and he would have desired her if it had not been that he saw the argument of his lord thus it was that we might ward off from him evil and lewdness lo he was of our chosen slaves and they raced with one another to the door and she tore his shirt from behind and they met her lord and master at the door she said what shall be his reward who wisheth evil to thy folk save prison or painful doom joseph said she it was who asked of me an evil act and witness of her own folk testified if his shirt is torn from before then she speaketh truth and he is of the liars and if his shirt is torn from behind then she hath lied and he is of the truthful so when he saw his shirt torn from behind he said lo this is of the guile of you women lo the guile of you is very great joseph turn away from this and thou woman ask forgiveness for thy sin lo thou art of the faulty and women in the city said the ruler wife is asking of her slave boy an ill deed indeed he has smitten her to the heart with love we behold her in plain aberration and when she heard of their sly talk she sent to them and prepared for them cushioned couch to lie on at the feast and gave to every one of them knife and said to joseph come out unto them and when they saw him they exalted him and cut their hands exclaiming allah blameless this is no human being this is not other than some gracious angel she said this is he on whose account ye blamed me asked of him an evil act but he proved continent but if he do not my behest he verily shall be imprisoned and verily shall be of those brought low he said my lord prison is more dear than that unto which they urge me and if thou fend not off their wiles from me shall incline unto them and become of the foolish so his lord heard his prayer and fended off their wiles from him lo he is hearer knower and it seemed good to them the men folk after they had seen the signs of his innocence to imprison him for time and two young men went to prison with him one of them said dreamed that was pressing wine the other said dreamed that was carrying upon my head bread whereof the birds were eating announce unto us the interpretation for we see thee of those good at interpretation he said the food which ye are given daily shall not come unto you but shall tell you the interpretation ere it cometh unto you this is of that which my lord hath taught me lo have forsaken the religion of folk who believe not in allah and are disbelievers in the hereafter and have followed the religion of my fathers abraham and isaac and jacob it never was for us to attribute aught as partner to allah this is of the bounty of allah unto us the seed of abraham and unto mankind but most men give not thanks my fellow prisoners are divers lords better or allah the one almighty those whom ye worship beside him are but names which ye have named ye and your fathers allah hath revealed no sanction for them the decision rests with allah only who hath commanded you that ye worship none save him this is the right religion but most men know not my two fellow prisoners as for one of you he will pour out wine for his lord to drink and as for the other he will be crucified so that the birds will eat from his head thus is the case judged concerning which ye did inquire and he said unto him of the twain who he knew would be released mention me in the presence of thy lord but satan caused him to forget to mention it to his lord so he joseph stayed in prison for some years and the king said lo saw in dream seven fat kine which seven lean were eating and seven green ears of corn and other seven dry notables expound for me my vision if ye can interpret dreams they answered jumbled dreams and we are not knowing in the interpretation of dreams and he of the two who was released and now at length remembered said am going to announce unto you the interpretation therefore send me forth and when he came to joseph in the prison he exclaimed joseph thou truthful one expound for us the seven fat kine which seven lean were eating and the seven green ears of corn and other seven dry that may return unto the people so that they may know he said ye shall sow seven years as usual but that which ye reap leave it in the ear all save little which ye eat then after that will come seven hard years which will devour all that ye have prepared for them save little of that which ye have stored then after that will come year when the people will have plenteous crops and when they will press wine and oil and the king said bring him unto me and when the messenger came unto him he joseph said return unto thy lord and ask him what was the case of the women who cut their hands lo my lord knoweth their guile he the king then sent for those women and said what happened when ye asked an evil act of joseph they answered allah blameless we know no evil of him said the wife of the ruler now the truth is out asked of him an evil act and he is surely of the truthful then joseph said asked for this that he my lord may know that betrayed him not in secret and that surely allah guideth not the snare of the betrayers do not exculpate myself lo the human soul enjoineth unto evil save that whereon my lord hath mercy lo my lord is forgiving merciful and the king said bring him unto me that may attach him to my person and when he had talked with him he said lo thou art to day in our presence established and trusted he said set me over the storehouses of the land lo am skilled custodian thus gave we power to joseph in the land he was the owner of it where he pleased we reach with our mercy whom we will we lose not the reward of the good and the reward of the hereafter is better for those who believe and ward off evil and joseph brethren came and presented themselves before him and he knew them but they knew him not and when he provided them with their provision he said bring unto me brother of yours from your father see ye not that fill up the measure and am the best of hosts and if ye bring him not unto me then there shall be no measure for you with me nor shall ye draw near they said we will try to win him from his father that we will surely do he said unto his young men place their merchandise in their saddlebags so that they may know it when they go back to their folk and so will come again so when they went back to their father they said our father the measure is denied us so send with us our brother that we may obtain the measure surely we will guard him well he said can entrust him to you save as entrusted his brother to you aforetime allah is better at guarding and he is the most merciful of those who show mercy and when they opened their belongings they discovered that their merchandise had been returned to them they said our father what more can we ask here is our merchandise returned to us we shall get provision for our folk and guard our brother and we shall have the extra measure of camel load this that we bring now is light measure he said will not send him with you till ye give me an undertaking in the name of allah that ye will bring him back to me unless ye are surrounded and when they gave him their undertaking he said allah is the warden over what we say and he said my sons go not in by one gate go in by different gates can naught avail you as against allah lo the decision rests with allah only in him do put my trust and in him let all the trusting put their trust and when they entered in the manner which their father had enjoined it would have naught availed them as against allah it was but need of jacob soul which he thus satisfied and lo he was lord of knowledge because we had taught him but most of mankind know not and when they went in before joseph he took his brother unto him saying lo even am thy brother therefore sorrow not for what they did and when he provided them with their provision he put the drinking cup in his brother saddlebag and then crier cried camel riders lo ye are surely thieves they cried coming toward them what is it ye have lost they said we have lost the king cup and he who bringeth it shall have camel load and said joseph am answerable for it they said by allah well ye know we came not to do evil in the land and are no thieves they said and what shall be the penalty for it if ye prove liars they said the penalty for it he in whose bag the cup is found he is the penalty for it thus we requite wrong doers then he joseph began the search with their bags before his brother bag then he produced it from his brother bag thus did we contrive for joseph he could not have taken his brother according to the king law unless allah willed we raise by grades of mercy whom we will and over every lord of knowledge there is one more knowing they said if he stealeth brother of his stole before but joseph kept it secret in his soul and revealed it not unto them he said within himself ye are in worse case and allah knoweth best the truth of that which ye allege they said ruler of the land lo he hath very aged father so take one of us instead of him lo we behold thee of those who do kindness he said allah forbid that we should seize save him with whom we found our property then truly we should be wrong doers so when they despaired of moving him they conferred together apart the eldest of them said know ye not how your father took an undertaking from you in allah name and how ye failed in the case of joseph aforetime therefore shall not go forth from the land until my father giveth leave or allah judgeth for me he is the best of judges return unto your father and say our father lo thy son hath stolen we testify only to that which we know we are not guardians of the unseen ask the township where we were and the caravan with which we travelled hither lo we speak the truth and when they came unto their father and had spoken thus to him he said nay but your minds have beguiled you into something my course is comely patience it may be that allah will bring them all unto me lo he only he is the knower the wise and he turned away from them and said alas my grief for joseph and his eyes were whitened with the sorrow that he was suppressing they said by allah thou wilt never cease remembering joseph till thy health is ruined or thou art of those who perish he said expose my distress and anguish only unto allah and know from allah that which ye know not go my sons and ascertain concerning joseph and his brother and despair not of the spirit of allah lo none despaireth of the spirit of allah save disbelieving folk and when they came again before him joseph they said ruler misfortune hath touched us and our folk and we bring but poor merchandise so fill for us the measure and be charitable unto us lo allah will requite the charitable he said know ye what ye did unto joseph and his brother in your ignorance they said is it indeed thou who art joseph he said am joseph and this is my brother allah hath shown us favour lo he who wardeth off evil and endureth findeth favour for lo allah loseth not the wages of the kindly they said by allah verily allah hath preferred thee above us and we were indeed sinful he said have no fear this day may allah forgive you and he is the most merciful of those who show mercy go with this shirt of mine and lay it on my father face he will become again seer and come to me with all your folk when the caravan departed their father had said truly am conscious of the breath of joseph though ye call me dotard those around him said by allah lo thou art in thine old aberration then when the bearer of glad tidings came he laid it on his face and he became seer once more he said said not unto you that know from allah that which ye know not they said our father ask forgiveness of our sins for us for lo we were sinful he said shall ask forgiveness for you of my lord lo he is the forgiving the merciful and when they came in before joseph he took his parents unto him and said come into egypt safe if allah will and he placed his parents on the dais and they fell down before him prostrate and he said my father this is the interpretation of my dream of old my lord hath made it true and he hath shown me kindness since he took me out of the prison and hath brought you from the desert after satan had made strife between me and my brethren lo my lord is tender unto whom he will he is the knower the wise my lord thou hast given me something of sovereignty and hast taught me something of the interpretation of events creator of the heavens and the earth thou art my protecting guardian in the world and the hereafter make me to die muslim unto thee and join me to the righteous this is of the tidings of the unseen which we inspire in thee muhammad thou wast not present with them when they fixed their plan and they were scheming and though thou try much most men will not believe thou askest them no fee for it it is naught else than reminder unto the peoples how many portent is there in the heavens and the earth which they pass by with face averted and most of them believe not in allah except that they attribute partners unto him deem they themselves secure from the coming on them of pall of allah punishment or the coming of the hour suddenly while they are unaware say this is my way call on allah with sure knowledge and whosoever followeth me glory be to allah and am not of the idolaters we sent not before thee any among the folk of the townships the nature of the consequence for abode of the hereafter for those sense messengers save men whom we inspired from have they not travelled in the land and seen those who were before them and verily the who ward off evil is best have ye then no till when the messengers despaired and thought that they were denied then came unto them our help and whom we would was saved and our wrath cannot be warded from the guilty in their history verily there is lesson for men of understanding it is no invented story but confirmation of the existing scripture and detailed explanation of everything and guidance and mercy for folk who believe sura ar rad the thunder alif lam mim ra these are verses of the scripture that which is revealed unto thee from thy lord is the truth but most of mankind believe not allah it is who raised up the heavens without visible supports then mounted the throne and compelled the sun and the moon to be of service each runneth unto an appointed term he ordereth the course he detaileth the revelations that haply ye may be certain of the meeting with your lord and he it is who spread out the earth and placed therein firm hills and flowing streams and of all fruits he placed therein two spouses male and female he covereth the night with the day lo herein verily are portents for people who take thought and in the earth are neighbouring tracts vineyards and ploughed lands and date palms like and unlike which are watered with one water and we have made some of them to excel others in fruit lo herein verily are portents for people who have sense and if thou wonderest then wondrous is their saying when we are dust are we then forsooth to be raised in new creation such are they who disbelieve in their lord such have carcans on their necks such are rightful owners of the fire they will abide therein and they bid thee hasten on the evil rather than the good when exemplary punishments have indeed occurred before them but lo thy lord is rich in pardon for mankind despite their wrong and lo thy lord is strong in punishment those who disbelieve say if only some portent were sent down upon him from his lord thou art warner only and for every folk guide allah knoweth that which every female beareth and that which the wombs absorb and that which they grow and everything with him is measured he is the knower of the invisible and the visible the great the high exalted alike of you is he who hideth the saying and he who noiseth it abroad he who lurketh in the night and he who goeth freely in the daytime for him are angels ranged before him and behind him who guard him by allah command lo allah changeth not the condition of folk until they first change that which is in their hearts and if allah willeth misfortune for folk there is none that can repel it nor have they defender beside him he it is who showeth you the lightning fear and hope and raiseth the heavy clouds the thunder hymneth his praise and so do the angels for awe of him he launcheth the thunderbolts and smiteth with them whom he will while they dispute in doubt concerning allah and he is mighty in wrath unto him is the real prayer those unto whom they pray beside allah respond to them not at all save as is the response to one who stretcheth forth his hands toward water asking that it may come unto his mouth and it will never reach it the prayer of disbelievers goeth far astray and unto allah falleth prostrate whosoever is in the heavens and the earth willingly or unwillingly as do their shadows in the morning and the evening hours say muhammad who is lord of the heavens and the earth say allah say take ye then others beside him for protectors which even for themselves have neither benefit nor hurt say is the blind man equal to the seer or is darkness equal to light or assign they unto allah partners who created the like of his creation so that the creation which they made and his creation seemed alike to them say allah is the creator of all things and he is the one the almighty he sendeth down water from the sky so that valleys flow according to their measure and the flood beareth on its surface swelling foam from that which they smelt in the fire in order to make ornaments and tools riseth foam like unto it thus allah coineth the similitude of the true and the false then as for the foam it passeth away as scum upon the banks while as for that which is of use to mankind it remaineth in the earth thus allah coineth the similitudes for those who answered allah call is bliss and for those who answered not his call if they had all that is in the earth and therewith the like thereof they would proffer it as ransom such will have woeful reckoning and their habitation will be hell dire abode is he who knoweth that what is revealed unto thee from thy lord is the truth like him who is blind but only men of understanding heed such as keep the pact of allah and break not the covenant such as unite that which allah hath commandeth should be joined and fear their lord and dread woeful reckoning such as persevere in seeking their lord countenance and are regular in prayer and spend of that which we bestow upon them secretly and openly and overcome evil with good theirs will be the sequel of the heavenly home gardens of eden which they enter along with all who do right of their fathers and their helpmeets and their seed the angels enter unto them from every gate saying peace be unto you because ye persevered ah passing sweet will be the sequel of the heavenly home and those who break the covenant of allah after ratifying it and sever that which allah hath commanded should be joined and make mischief in the earth theirs is the curse and theirs the ill abode allah enlargeth livelihood for whom he will and straiteneth it for whom he will and they rejoice in the life of the world whereas the life of the world is but brief comfort as compared with the hereafter those who disbelieve say if only portent were sent down upon him from his lord say lo allah sendeth whom he will astray and guideth unto himself all who turn unto him who have believed and whose hearts have rest in the remembrance of allah verily in the remembrance of allah do hearts find rest those who believe and do right joy is for them and bliss their journey end thus we send thee muhammad unto nation before whom other nations have passed away that thou mayst recite unto them that which we have inspired in thee while they are disbelievers in the beneficent say he is my lord there is no allah save him in him do put my trust and unto him is my recourse had it been possible for lecture to cause the mountains to move or the earth to be torn asunder or the dead to speak this qur an would have done so nay but allah is the whole command do not those who believe know that had allah willed he could have guided all mankind as for those who disbelieve disaster ceaseth not to strike them because of what they do or it dwelleth near their home until the threat of allah come to pass lo allah faileth not to keep the tryst and verily messengers of allah were mocked before thee but long bore with those who disbelieved at length seized them and how awful was my punishment is he who is aware of the deserts of every soul as he who is aware of nothing yet they ascribe unto allah partners say name them is it that ye would inform him of something which he knoweth not in the earth or is it but way of speaking nay but their contrivance is made seeming fair for those who disbelieve and they are kept from the right road he whom allah sendeth astray for him there is no guide for them is torment in the life of the world and verily the doom of the hereafter is more painful and they have no defender from allah similitude of the garden which is promised unto those who keep their duty to allah underneath it rivers flow its food is everlasting and its shade this is the reward of those who keep their duty while the reward of disbelievers is the fire those unto whom we gave the scripture rejoice in that which is revealed unto thee and of the clans there are who deny some of it say am commanded only that serve allah and ascribe unto him no partner unto him cry and unto him is my return thus have we revealed it decisive utterance in arabic and if thou shouldst follow their desires after that which hath come unto thee of knowledge then truly wouldst thou have from allah no protecting friend nor defender and verily we sent messengers to mankind before thee and we appointed for them wives and offspring and it was not given to any messenger that he should bring portent save by allah leave for everything there is time prescribed allah effaceth what he will and establisheth what he will and with him is the source of ordinance whether we let thee see something of that which we have promised them or make thee die before its happening thine is but conveyance of the message ours the reckoning see they not how we aim to the land reducing it of its outlying parts when allah doometh there is none that can postpone his doom and he is swift at reckoning those who were before them plotted but all plotting is allah he knoweth that which each soul earneth the disbelievers will come to know for whom will be the sequel of the heavenly home they who disbelieve say thou art no messenger of allah say allah and whosoever hath knowledge of the scripture is sufficient witness between me and you sura ibrahim abraham alif lam ra this is scripture which we have revealed unto thee muhammad that thereby thou mayst bring forth mankind from darkness unto light by the permission of their lord unto the path of the mighty the owner of praise allah unto whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth and woe unto the disbelievers from an awful doom those who love the life of the world more than the hereafter and debar men from the way of allah and would have it crooked such are far astray and we never sent messenger save with the language of his folk that he might make the message clear for them then allah sendeth whom he will astray and guideth whom he will he is the mighty the wise we verily sent moses with our revelations saying bring thy people forth from darkness unto light and remind them of the days of allah lo therein are revelations for each steadfast thankful heart and remind them how moses said unto his people remember allah favour unto you when he delivered you from pharaoh folk who were afflicting you with dreadful torment and were slaying your sons and sparing your women that was tremendous trial from your lord and when your lord proclaimed if ye give thanks will give you more but if ye are thankless lo my punishment is dire and moses said though ye and all who are in the earth prove thankless lo allah verily is absolute owner of praise hath not the history of those before you reached you the folk of noah and the tribes of ad and thamud and those after them none save allah knoweth them their messengers came unto them with clear proofs but they thrust their hands into their mouths and said lo we disbelieve in that wherewith ye have been sent and lo we are in grave doubt concerning that to which ye call us their messengers said can there be doubt concerning allah the creator of the heavens and the earth he calleth you that he may forgive you your sins and reprieve you unto an appointed term they said ye are but mortals like us who would fain turn us away from what our fathers used to worship then bring some clear warrant their messengers said unto them we are but mortals like you but allah giveth grace unto whom he will of his slaves it is not ours to bring you warrant unless by the permission of allah in allah let believers put their trust how should we not put our trust in allah when he hath shown us our ways we surely will endure the hurt ye do us in allah let the trusting put their trust and those who disbelieved said unto their messengers verily we will drive you out from our land unless ye return to our religion then their lord inspired them saying verily we shall destroy the wrong doers and verily we shall make you to dwell in the land after them this is for him who feareth my majesty and feareth my threats and they sought help from their lord and every froward potentate was bought to naught hell is before him and he is made to drink festering water which he sippeth but can hardly swallow and death cometh unto him from every side while yet he cannot die and before him is harsh doom similitude of those who disbelieve in their lord their works are as ashes which the wind bloweth hard upon stormy day they have no control of aught that they have earned that is the extreme failure hast thou not seen that allah hath created the heavens and the earth with truth if he will he can remove you and bring in some new creation and that is no great matter for allah they all come forth unto their lord then those who were despised say unto those who were scornful we were unto you following can ye then avert from us aught of allah doom they say had allah guided us we should have guided you whether we rage or patiently endure is now all one for us we have no place of refuge and satan saith when the matter hath been decided lo allah promised you promise of truth and promised you then failed you and had no power over you save that called unto you and ye obeyed me so blame not but blame yourselves cannot help you nor can ye help me lo disbelieved in that which ye before ascribed to me lo for wrong doers is painful doom and those who believed and did good works are made to enter gardens underneath which rivers flow therein abiding by permission of their lord their greeting therein peace seest thou not how allah coineth similitude goodly saying as goodly tree its root set firm its branches reaching into heaven giving its fruit at every season by permission of its lord allah coineth the similitudes for mankind in order that they may reflect and the similitude of bad saying is as bad tree uprooted from upon the earth possessing no stability allah confirmeth those who believe by firm saying in the life of the world and in the hereafter and allah sendeth wrong doers astray and allah doeth what he will hast thou not seen those who gave the grace of allah in exchange for thanklessness and led their people down to the abode of loss even to hell they are exposed thereto hapless end and they set up rivals to allah that they may mislead men from his way say enjoy life while ye may for lo your journey end will be the fire tell my bondmen who believe to establish worship and spend of that which we have given them secretly and publicly before day cometh wherein there will be neither traffick nor befriending allah is he who created the heavens and the earth and causeth water to descend from the sky thereby producing fruits as food for you and maketh the ships to be of service unto you that they may run upon the sea at his command and hath made of service unto you the rivers and maketh the sun and the moon constant in their courses to be of service unto you and hath made of service unto you the night and the day and he giveth you of all ye ask of him and if ye would count the bounty of allah ye cannot reckon it lo man is verily wrong doer an ingrate and when abraham said my lord make safe this territory and preserve me and my sons from serving idols my lord lo they have led many of mankind astray but whoso followeth me he verily is of me and whoso disobeyeth me still thou art forgiving merciful our lord lo have settled some of my posterity in an uncultivable valley near unto thy holy house our lord that they may establish proper worship so incline some hearts of men that they may yearn toward them and provide thou them with fruits in order that they may be thankful our lord lo thou knowest that which we hide and that which we proclaim nothing in the earth or in the heaven is hidden from allah praise be to allah who hath given me in my old age ishmael and isaac lo my lord is indeed the hearer of prayer my lord make me to establish proper worship and some of my posterity also our lord and accept my prayer our lord forgive me and my parents and believers on the day when the account is cast deem not that allah is unaware of what the wicked do he but giveth them respite till day when eyes will stare in terror as they come hurrying on in fear their heads upraised their gaze returning not to them and their hearts as air and warn mankind of day when the doom will come upon them and those who did wrong will say our lord reprieve us for little while we will obey thy call and will follow the messengers it will be answered did ye not swear before that there would be no end for you and have ye not dwelt in the dwellings of those who wronged themselves of old and hath it not become plain to you how we dealt with them and made examples for you verily they have plotted their plot and their plot is with allah though their plot were one whereby the mountains should be moved so think not that allah will fail to keep his promise to his messengers lo allah is mighty able to requite the wrong on the day when the earth will be changed to other than the earth and the heavens also will be changed and they will come forth unto allah the one the almighty thou wilt see the guilty on that day linked together in chains their raiment of pitch and the fire covering their faces that allah may repay each soul what it hath earned lo allah is swift at reckoning this is clear message for mankind in order that they may be warned thereby and that they may know that he is only one allah and that men of understanding may take heed sura al hijr al hijr stoneland rock city alif lam ra these are verses of the scripture and plain reading it may be that those who disbelieve wish ardently that they were muslims let them eat and enjoy life and let false hope beguile them they will come to know and we destroyed no township but there was known decree for it no nation can outstrip its term nor can they lag behind and they say thou unto whom the reminder is revealed lo thou art indeed madman why bringest thou not angels unto us if thou art of the truthful we send not down the angels save with the fact and in that case the disbelievers would not be tolerated lo we even we reveal the reminder and lo we verily are its guardian we verily sent messengers before thee among the factions of the men of old and never came there unto them messenger but they did mock him thus do we make it traverse the hearts of the guilty they believe not therein though the example of the men of old hath gone before and even if we opened unto them gate of heaven and they kept mounting through it they would say our sight is wrong nay but we are folk bewitched and verily in the heaven we have set mansions of the stars and we have beautified it for beholders and we have guarded it from every outcast devil save him who stealeth the hearing and them doth clear flame pursue and the earth have we spread out and placed therein firm hills and caused each seemly thing to grow therein and we have given unto you livelihoods therein and unto those for whom ye provide not and there is not thing but with us are the stores thereof and we send it not down save in appointed measure and we send the winds fertilising and cause water to descend from the sky and give it you to drink it is not ye who are the holders of the store thereof lo and it is we even we who quicken and give death and we are the inheritor and verily we know the eager among you and verily we know the laggards lo thy lord will gather them together lo he is wise aware doesn really matter what he created man of and the jinn did we create aforetime of essential fire and remember when thy lord said unto the angels lo am creating mortal out of potter clay of black mud altered so when have made him and have breathed into him of my spirit do ye fall down prostrating yourselves unto him so the angels fell prostrate all of them together save iblis he refused to be among the prostrate he said iblis what aileth thee that thou art not among the prostrate he said am not one to prostrate myself unto mortal whom thou hast created out of potter clay of black mud altered he said then go thou forth from hence for lo thou art outcast and lo the curse shall be upon thee till the day of judgment he said my lord reprieve me till the day when they are raised he said then lo thou art of those reprieved till the day of appointed time he said my lord because thou hast sent me astray verily shall adorn the path of error for them in the earth and shall mislead them every one save such of them as are thy perfectly devoted slaves he said this is right course incumbent upon me lo as for my slaves thou hast no power over any of them save such of the froward as follow thee and lo for all such hell will be the promised place it hath seven gates and each gate hath an appointed portion lo those who ward off evil are among gardens and watersprings and it is said unto them enter them in peace secure and we remove whatever rancour may be in their breasts as brethren face to face they rest on couches raised toil cometh not unto them there nor will they be expelled from thence announce muhammad unto my slaves that verily am the forgiving the merciful and that my doom is the dolorous doom and tell them of abraham guests how when they came in unto him and said peace he said lo we are afraid of you they said be not afraid lo we bring thee good tidings of boy possessing wisdom he said bring ye me good tidings of son when old age hath overtaken me of what then can ye bring good tidings they said we bring thee good tidings in truth so be not thou of the despairing he said and who despaireth of the mercy of his lord save those who are astray he said and afterward what is your business ye messengers of allah they said we have been sent unto guilty folk all save the family of lot them we shall deliver every one except his wife of whom we had decreed that she should be of those who stay behind and when the messengers came unto the family of lot he said lo ye are folk unknown to me they said nay but we bring thee that concerning which they keep disputing and bring thee the truth and lo we are truth tellers so travel with thy household in portion of the night and follow thou their backs let none of you turn round but go whither ye are commanded and we made plain the case to him that the root of them who did wrong was to be cut at early morn and the people of the city came rejoicing at the news of new arrivals he said lo they are my guests affront me not and keep your duty to allah and shame me not they said have we not forbidden you from entertaining anyone he said here are my daughters if ye must be doing so by thy life muhammad they moved blindly in the frenzy of approaching death then the awful cry overtook them at the sunrise and we utterly confounded them and we rained upon them stones of heated clay lo therein verily are portents for those who read the signs and lo it is upon road still uneffaced lo therein is indeed portent for believers and the dwellers in the wood indeed were evil doers so we took vengeance on them and lo they both are on high road plain to see and the dwellers in al hijr denied our messengers and we gave them our revelations but they were averse to them and they used to hew out dwellings from the hills wherein they dwelt secure but the awful cry overtook them at the morning hour and that which they were wont to count as gain availed them not we created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them save with truth and lo the hour is surely coming so forgive muhammad with gracious forgiveness lo thy lord he is the all wise creator we have given thee seven of the oft repeated verses and the great qur an strain not thine eyes toward that which we cause some wedded pairs among them to enjoin and be not grieved on their account and lower thy wing in tenderness for the believers and say lo even am plain warner such as we send down for those who make division those who break the qur an into parts them by thy lord we shall question every one of what they used to do so proclaim that which thou art commanded and withdraw from the idolaters lo we defend thee from the scoffers who set some other god along with allah but they will come to know well know we that thy bosom is oppressed by what they say but hymn the praise of thy lord and be of those who make prostration unto him and serve thy lord till the inevitable cometh unto thee sura an nahl the bee the commandment of allah will come to pass so seek not ye to hasten it glorified and exalted be he above all that they associate with him he sendeth down the angels with the spirit of his command unto whom he will of his bondmen saying warn mankind that there is no allah save me so keep your duty unto me he hath created the heavens and the earth with truth high be he exalted above all that they associate with him he hath created man from drop of fluid yet behold he is an open opponent and the cattle hath he created whence ye have warm clothing and uses and whereof ye eat and wherein is beauty for you when ye bring them home and when ye take them out to pasture and they bear your loads for you unto land ye could not reach save with great trouble to yourselves lo your lord is full of pity merciful and horses and mules and asses hath he created that ye may ride them and for ornament and he createth that which ye know not and allah is the direction of the way and some roads go not straight and had he willed he would have led you all aright he it is who sendeth down water from the sky whence ye have drink and whence are trees on which ye send your beasts to pasture therewith he causeth crops to grow for you and the olive and the date palm and grapes and all kinds of fruit lo herein is indeed portent for people who reflect and he hath constrained the night and the day and the sun and the moon to be of service unto you and the stars are made subservient by his command lo herein indeed are portents for people who have sense and whatsoever he hath created for you in the earth of divers hues lo therein is indeed portent for people who take heed and he it is who hath constrained the sea to be of service that ye eat fresh meat from thence and bring forth from thence ornaments which ye wear and thou seest the ships ploughing it that ye mankind may seek of his bounty and that haply ye may give thanks and he hath cast into the earth firm hills that it quake not with you and streams and roads that ye may find way and landmarks too and by the star they find way is he then who createth as him who createth not will ye not then remember and if ye would count the favour of allah ye cannot reckon it lo allah is indeed forgiving merciful and allah knoweth that which ye keep hidden and that which ye proclaim those unto whom they cry beside allah created naught but are themselves created they are dead not living and they know not when they will be raised your allah is one allah but as for those who believe not in the hereafter their hearts refuse to know for they are proud assuredly allah knoweth that which they keep hidden and that which they proclaim lo he loveth not the proud and when it is said unto them what hath your lord revealed they say mere fables of the men of old that they may bear their burdens undiminished on the day of resurrection with somewhat of the burdens of those whom they mislead without knowledge ah evil is that which they bear those before them plotted so allah struck at the foundations of their building and then the roof fell down upon them from above them and the doom came on them whence they knew not then on the day of resurrection he will disgrace them and will say where are my partners for whose sake ye opposed my guidance those who have been given knowledge will say disgrace this day and evil are upon the disbelievers whom the angels cause to die while they are wronging themselves then will they make full submission saying we used not to do any wrong nay surely allah is knower of what ye used to do so enter the gates of hell to dwell therein for ever woeful indeed will be the lodging of the arrogant and it is said unto those who ward off evil what hath your lord revealed they say good for those who do good in this world there is good reward and the home of the hereafter will be better pleasant indeed will be the home of those who ward off evil gardens of eden which they enter underneath which rivers flow wherein they have what they will thus allah repayeth those who ward off evil those whom the angels cause to die when they are good they say peace be unto you enter the garden because of what ye used to do await they aught say that the angels should come unto them or thy lord command should come to pass even so did those before them allah wronged them not but they did wrong themselves so that the evils of what they did smote them and that which they used to mock surrounded them and the idolaters say had allah willed we had not worshipped aught beside him we and our fathers nor had we forbidden aught without command from him even so did those before them are the messengers charged with aught save plain conveyance of the message and verily we have raised in every nation messenger proclaiming serve allah and shun false gods then some of them there were whom allah guided and some of them there were upon whom error had just hold do but travel in the land and see the nature of the consequence for the deniers even if thou muhammad desirest their right guidance still allah assuredly will not guide him who misleadeth such have no helpers and they swear by allah their most binding oaths that allah will not raise up him who dieth nay but it is promise binding upon him in truth but most of mankind know not that he may explain unto them that wherein they differ and that those who disbelieved may know that they were liars and our word unto thing when we intend it is only that we say unto it be and it is and those who became fugitives for the cause of allah after they had been oppressed we verily shall give them goodly lodging in the world and surely the reward of the hereafter is greater if they but knew such as are steadfast and put their trust in allah and we sent not as our messengers before thee other than men whom we inspired ask the followers of the remembrance if ye know not with clear proofs and writings and we have revealed unto thee the remembrance that thou mayst explain to mankind that which hath been revealed for them and that haply they may reflect are they who plan ill deeds then secure that allah will not cause the earth to swallow them or that the doom will not come on them whence they know not or that he will not seize them in their going to and fro so that there be no escape for them or that he will not seize them with gradual wasting lo thy lord is indeed full of pity merciful have they not observed all things that allah hath created how their shadows incline to the right and to the left making prostration unto allah and they are lowly and unto allah maketh prostration whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth of living creatures and the angels also and they are not proud they fear their lord above them and do what they are bidden allah hath said choose not two gods there is only one allah so of me me only be in awe unto him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and religion is his for ever will ye then fear any other than allah and whatever of comfort ye enjoy it is from allah then when misfortune reacheth you unto him ye cry for help and afterward when he hath rid you of the misfortune behold set of you attribute partners to their lord so as to deny that which we have given them then enjoy life while ye may for ye will come to know and they assign portion of that which we have given them unto what they know not by allah but ye will indeed be asked concerning all that ye used to invent and they assign unto allah daughters be he glorified and unto themselves what they desire when if one of them receiveth tidings of the birth of female his face remaineth darkened and he is wroth inwardly he hideth himself from the folk because of the evil of that whereof he hath had tidings asking himself shall he keep it in contempt or bury it beneath the dust verily evil is their judgment for those who believe not in the hereafter is an evil similitude and allah is the sublime similitude he is the mighty the wise if allah were to take mankind to task for their wrong doing he would not leave hereon living creature but he reprieveth them to an appointed term and when their term cometh they cannot put it off an hour nor yet advance it and they assign unto allah that which they themselves dislike and their tongues expound the lie that the better portion will be theirs assuredly theirs will be the fire and they will be abandoned by allah we verily sent messengers unto the nations before thee but the devil made their deeds fairseeming unto them so he is their patron this day and theirs will be painful doom and we have revealed the scripture unto thee only that thou mayst explain unto them that wherein they differ and as guidance and mercy for people who believe allah sendeth down water from the sky and therewith reviveth the earth after her death lo herein is indeed portent for folk who hear and lo in the cattle there is lesson for you we give you to drink of that which is in their bellies from betwixt the refuse and the blood pure milk palatable to the drinkers and of the fruits of the date palm and grapes whence ye derive strong drink and also good nourishment lo therein is indeed portent for people who have sense and thy lord inspired the bee saying choose thou habitations in the hills and in the trees and in that which they thatch then eat of all fruits and follow the ways of thy lord made smooth for thee there cometh forth from their bellies drink divers of hues wherein is healing for mankind lo herein is indeed portent for people who reflect and allah createth you then causeth you to die and among you is he who is brought back to the most abject stage of life so that he knoweth nothing after having had knowledge lo allah is knower powerful and allah hath favoured some of you above others in provision now those who are more favoured will by no means hand over their provision to those slaves whom their right hands possess so that they may be equal with them in respect thereof is it then the grace of allah that they deny and allah hath given you wives of your own kind and hath given you from your wives sons and grandsons and hath made provision of good things for you is it then in vanity that they believe and in the grace of allah that they disbelieve and they worship beside allah that which owneth no provision whatsoever for them from the heavens or the earth nor have they whom they worship any power so coin not similitudes for allah lo allah knoweth ye know not allah coineth similitude on the one hand mere chattel slave who hath control of nothing and on the other hand one on whom we have bestowed fair provision from us and he spendeth thereof secretly and openly are they equal praise be to allah but most of them know not and allah coineth similitude two men one of them dumb having control of nothing and he is burden on his owner whithersoever he directeth him to go he bringeth no good is he equal with one who enjoineth justice and followeth straight path of conduct and unto allah belongeth the unseen of the heavens and the earth and the matter of the hour of doom is but as twinkling of the eye or it is nearer still lo allah is able to do all things and allah brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers knowing nothing and gave you hearing and sight and hearts that haply ye might give thanks have they not seen the birds obedient in mid air none holdeth them save allah lo herein verily are portents for people who believe and allah hath given you in your houses an abode and hath given you also of the hides of cattle houses which ye find light to carry on the day of migration and on the day of pitching camp and of their wool and their fur and their hair caparison and comfort for while and allah hath given you of that which he hath created shelter from the sun and hath given you places of refuge in the mountains and hath given you coats to ward off the heat from you and coats of armour to save you from your own foolhardiness thus doth he perfect his favour unto you in order that ye may surrender unto him then if they turn away thy duty muhammad is but plain conveyance of the message they know the favour of allah and then deny it most of them are ingrates and bethink you of the day when we raise up of every nation witness then there is no leave for disbelievers nor are they allowed to make amends and when those who did wrong behold the doom it will not be made light for them nor will they be reprieved and when those who ascribed partners to allah behold those partners of theirs they will say our lord these are our partners unto whom we used to cry instead of thee but they will fling to them the saying lo ye verily are liars and they proffer unto allah submission on that day and all that they used to invent hath failed them for those who disbelieve and debar men from the way of allah we add doom to doom because they wrought corruption and bethink you of the day when we raise in every nation witness against them of their own folk and we bring thee muhammad as witness against these and we reveal the scripture unto thee as an exposition of all things and guidance and mercy and good tidings for those who have surrendered to allah lo allah enjoineth justice and kindness and giving to kinsfolk and forbiddeth lewdness and abomination and wickedness he exhorteth you in order that ye may take heed fulfil the covenant of allah when ye have covenanted and break not your oaths after the asseveration of them and after ye have made allah surety over you lo allah knoweth what ye do and be not like unto her who unravelleth the thread after she hath made it strong to thin filaments making your oaths deceit between you because of nation being more numerous than another nation allah only trieth you thereby and he verily will explain to you on the day of resurrection that wherein ye differed had allah willed he could have made you all one nation but he sendeth whom he will astray and guideth whom he will and ye will indeed be asked of what ye used to do make not your oaths deceit between you lest foot should slip after being firmly planted and ye should taste evil forasmuch as ye debarred men from the way of allah and yours should be an awful doom and purchase not small gain at the price of allah covenant lo that which allah hath is better for you if ye did but know that which ye have wasteth away and that which allah hath remaineth and verily we shall pay those who are steadfast recompense in proportion to the best of what they used to do whosoever doeth right whether male or female and is believer him verily we shall quicken with good life and we shall pay them recompense in proportion to the best of what they used to do and when thou recitest the qur an seek refuge in allah from satan the outcast lo he hath no power over those who believe and put trust in their lord his power is only over those who make friend of him and those who ascribe partners unto him allah and when we put revelation in place of another revelation and allah knoweth best what he revealeth they say lo thou art but inventing most of them know not say the holy spirit hath delivered it from thy lord with truth that it may confirm the faith of those who believe and as guidance and good tidings for those who have surrendered to allah and we know well that they say only man teacheth him the speech of him at whom they falsely hint is outlandish and this is clear arabic speech lo those who disbelieve the revelations of allah allah guideth them not and theirs will be painful doom only they invent falsehood who believe not allah revelations and only they are the liars whoso disbelieveth in allah after his belief save him who is forced thereto and whose heart is still content with the faith but whoso findeth ease in disbelief on them is wrath from allah theirs will be an awful doom that is because they have chosen the life of the world rather than the hereafter and because allah guideth not the disbelieving folk such are they whose hearts and ears and eyes allah hath sealed and such are the heedless assuredly in the hereafter they are the losers then lo thy lord for those who became fugitives after they had been persecuted and then fought and were steadfast lo thy lord afterward is for them indeed forgiving merciful on the day when every soul will come pleading for itself and every soul will be repaid what it did and they will not be wronged allah coineth similitude township that dwelt secure and well content its provision coming to it in abundance from every side but it disbelieved in allah favours so allah made it experience the garb of dearth and fear because of what they used to do and verily there had come unto them messenger from among them but they had denied him and so the torment seized them while they were wrong doers so eat of the lawful and good food which allah hath provided for you and thank the bounty of your lord if it is him ye serve he hath forbidden for you only carrion and blood and swineflesh and that which hath been immolated in the name of any other than allah but he who is driven thereto neither craving nor transgressing lo then allah is forgiving merciful and speak not concerning that which your own tongues qualify as clean or unclean the falsehood this is lawful and this is forbidden so that ye invent lie against allah lo those who invent lie against allah will not succeed brief enjoyment will be theirs and theirs painful doom and unto those who are jews we have forbidden that which we have already related unto thee and we wronged them not but they were wont to wrong themselves then lo thy lord for those who do evil in ignorance and afterward repent and amend lo for them thy lord is afterward indeed forgiving merciful lo abraham was nation obedient to allah by nature upright and he was not of the idolaters thankful for his bounties he chose him and he guided him unto straight path and we gave him good in the world and in the hereafter he is among the righteous and afterward we inspired thee muhammad saying follow the religion of abraham as one by nature upright he was not of the idolaters the sabbath was appointed only for those who differed concerning it and lo thy lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ call unto the way of thy lord with wisdom and fair exhortation and reason with them in the better way lo thy lord is best aware of him who strayeth from his way and he is best aware of those who go aright if ye punish then punish with the like of that wherewith ye were afflicted but if ye endure patiently verily it is better for the patient endure thou patiently muhammad thine endurance is only by the help of allah grieve not for them and be not in distress because of that which they devise lo allah is with those who keep their duty unto him and those who are doers of good sura al isra isra the night journey children of israel glorified be he who carried his servant by night from the inviolable place of worship to the far distant place of worship the neighbourhood whereof we have blessed that we might show him of our tokens lo he only he is the hearer the seer we gave unto moses the scripture and we appointed it guidance for the children of israel saying choose no guardian beside me they were the seed of those whom we carried in the ship along with noah lo he was grateful slave and we decreed for the children of israel in the scripture ye verily will work corruption in the earth twice and ye will become great tyrants so when the time for the first of the two came we roused against you slaves of ours of great might who ravaged your country and it was threat performed then we gave you once again your turn against them and we aided you with wealth and children and made you more in soldiery saying if ye do good ye do good for your own souls and if ye do evil it is for them in like manner so when the time for the second of the judgments came we roused against you others of our slaves to ravage you and to enter the temple even as they entered it the first time and to lay waste all that they conquered with an utter wasting it may be that your lord will have mercy on you but if ye repeat the crime we shall repeat the punishment and we have appointed hell dungeon for the disbelievers lo this qur an guideth unto that which is straightest and giveth tidings unto the believers who do good works that theirs will be great reward and that those who believe not in the hereafter for them we have prepared painful doom man prayeth for evil as he prayeth for good for man was ever hasty and we appoint the night and the day two portents then we make dark the portent of the night and we make the portent of the day sight giving that ye may seek bounty from your lord and that ye may know the computation of the years and the reckoning and everything have we expounded with clear expounding and every man augury have we fastened to his own neck and we shall bring forth for him on the day of resurrection book which he will find wide open and it will be said unto him read thy book thy soul sufficeth as reckoner against thee this day whosoever goeth right it is only for the good of his own soul that he goeth right and whosoever erreth erreth only to its hurt no laden soul can bear another load we never punish until we have sent messenger and when we would destroy township we send commandment to its folk who live at ease and afterward they commit abomination therein and so the word of doom hath effect for it and we annihilate it with complete annihilation how many generations have we destroyed since noah and allah sufficeth as knower and beholder of the sins of his slaves whoso desireth that life which hasteneth away we hasten for him therein what we will for whom we please and afterward we have appointed for him hell he will endure the heat thereof condemned rejected and whoso desireth the hereafter and striveth for it with the effort necessary being believer for such their effort findeth favour with their lord each do we supply both these and those from the bounty of thy lord and the bounty of thy lord can never be walled up see how we prefer one of them above another and verily the hereafter will be greater in degrees and greater in preferment set not up with allah any other god man lest thou sit down reproved forsaken thy lord hath decreed that ye worship none save him and that ye show kindness to parents if one of them or both of them attain old age with thee say not fie unto them nor repulse them but speak unto them gracious word and lower unto them the wing of submission through mercy and say my lord have mercy on them both as they did care for me when was little your lord is best aware of what is in your minds if ye are righteous then lo he was ever forgiving unto those who turn unto him give the kinsman his due and the needy and the wayfarer and squander not thy wealth in wantonness lo the squanderers were ever brothers of the devils and the devil was ever an ingrate to his lord but if thou turn away from them seeking mercy from thy lord for which thou hopest then speak unto them reasonable word and let not thy hand be chained to thy neck nor open it with complete opening lest thou sit down rebuked denuded lo thy lord enlargeth the provision for whom he will and straiteneth it for whom he will lo he was ever knower seer of his slaves slay not your children fearing fall to poverty we shall provide for them and for you lo the slaying of them is great sin and come not near unto adultery lo it is an abomination and an evil way and slay not the life which allah hath forbidden save with right whoso is slain wrongfully we have given power unto his heir but let him not commit excess in slaying lo he will be helped come not near the wealth of the orphan save with that which is better till he come to strength and keep the covenant lo of the covenant it will be asked fill the measure when ye measure and weigh with right balance that is meet and better in the end man follow not that whereof thou hast no knowledge lo the hearing and the sight and the heart of each of these it will be asked and walk not in the earth exultant lo thou canst not rend the earth nor canst thou stretch to the height of the hills the evil of all that is hateful in the sight of thy lord this is part of that wisdom wherewith thy lord hath inspired thee muhammad and set not up with allah any other god lest thou be cast into hell reproved abandoned hath your lord then distinguished you men of makka by giving you sons and hath chosen for himself females from among the angels lo verily ye speak an awful word we verily have displayed our warnings in this qur an that they may take heed but it increaseth them in naught save aversion say muhammad to the disbelievers if there were other gods along with him as they say then had they sought way against the lord of the throne glorified is he and high exalted above what they say the seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein praise him and there is not thing but hymneth his praise but ye understand not their praise lo he is ever clement forgiving and when thou recitest the qur an we place between thee and those who believe not in the hereafter hidden barrier and we place upon their hearts veils lest they should understand it and in their ears deafness and when thou makest mention of thy lord alone in the qur an they turn their backs in aversion we are best aware of what they wish to hear when they give ear to thee and when they take secret counsel when the evil doers say ye follow but man bewitched see what similitudes they coin for thee and thus are all astray and cannot find road and they say when we are bones and fragments shall we forsooth be raised up as new creation say be ye stones or iron or some created thing that is yet greater in your thoughts then they will say who shall bring us back to life say he who created you at the first then will they shake their heads at thee and say when will it be say it will perhaps be soon day when he will call you and ye will answer with his praise and ye will think that ye have tarried but little while tell my bondmen to speak that which is kindlier lo the devil soweth discord among them lo the devil is for man an open foe your lord is best aware of you if he will he will have mercy on you or if he will he will punish you we have not sent thee muhammad as warden over them and thy lord is best aware of all who are in the heavens and the earth and we preferred some of the prophets above others and unto david we gave the psalms say cry unto those saints and angels whom ye assume to be gods beside him yet they have no power to rid you of misfortune nor to change those unto whom they cry seek the way of approach to their lord which of them shall be the nearest they hope for his mercy and they fear his doom lo the doom of thy lord is to be shunned there is not township but we shall destroy it ere the day of resurrection or punish it with dire punishment that is set forth in the book of our decrees naught hindereth us from sending portents save that the folk of old denied them and we gave thamud the she camel clear portent save to warn and it was warning when we told thee lo thy lord encompasseth mankind and we appointed the sight which we showed thee as an ordeal for mankind and likewise the accursed tree in the qur an we warn them but it increaseth them in naught save gross impiety and when we said unto the angels fall down prostrate before adam and they fell prostrate all save iblis he said shall fall prostrate before that which thou hast created of clay he said seest thou this creature whom thou hast honoured above me if thou give me grace until the day of resurrection verily will seize his seed save but few he said go and whosoever of them followeth thee lo hell will be your payment ample payment and excite any of them whom thou canst with thy voice and urge thy horse and foot against them and be partner in their wealth and children and promise them satan promiseth them only to deceive lo my faithful bondmen over them thou hast no power and thy lord sufficeth as their guardian mankind your lord is he who driveth for you the ship upon the sea that ye may seek of his bounty lo he was ever merciful toward you and when harm toucheth you upon the sea all unto whom ye cry for succour fail save him alone but when he bringeth you safe to land ye turn away for man was ever thankless feel ye then secure that he will not cause slope of the land to engulf you or send sand storm upon you and then ye will find that ye have no protector or feel ye secure that he will not return you to that plight second time and send against you hurricane of wind and drown you for your thanklessness and then ye will not find therein that ye have any avenger against us verily we have honoured the children of adam we carry them on the land and the sea and have made provision of good things for them and have preferred them above many of those whom we created with marked preferment on the day when we shall summon all men with their record whoso is given his book in his right hand such will read their book and they will not be wronged shred whoso is blind here will be blind in the hereafter and yet further from the road and they indeed strove hard to beguile thee muhammad away from that wherewith we have inspired thee that thou shouldst invent other than it against us and then would they have accepted thee as friend and if we had not made thee wholly firm thou mightest almost have inclined unto them little then had we made thee taste double punishment of living and double punishment of dying then hadst thou found no helper against us and they indeed wished to scare thee from the land that they might drive thee forth from thence and then they would have stayed there but little after thee such was our method in the case of those whom we sent before thee to mankind and thou wilt not find for our method aught of power to change establish worship at the going down of the sun until the dark of night and the recital of the qur an at dawn lo the recital of the qur an at dawn is ever witnessed and some part of the night awake for it largess for thee it may be that thy lord will raise thee to praised estate and say my lord cause me to come in with firm incoming and to go out with firm outgoing and give me from thy presence sustaining power and say truth hath come and falsehood hath vanished away lo falsehood is ever bound to vanish and we reveal of the qur an that which is healing and mercy for believers though it increase the evil doers in naught save ruin and when we make life pleasant unto man he turneth away and is averse and when ill toucheth him he is in despair say each one doth according to his rule of conduct and thy lord is best aware of him whose way is right they are asking thee concerning the spirit say the spirit is by command of my lord and of knowledge ye have been vouchsafed but little and if we willed we could withdraw that which we have revealed unto thee then wouldst thou find no guardian for thee against us in respect thereof it is naught save mercy from thy lord lo his kindness unto thee was ever great say verily though mankind and the jinn should assemble to produce the like of this qur an they could not produce the like thereof though they were helpers one of another and verily we have displayed for mankind in this qur an all kind of similitudes but most of mankind refuse aught save disbelief and they say we will not put faith in thee till thou cause spring to gush forth from the earth for us or thou have garden of date palms and grapes and cause rivers to gush forth therein abundantly or thou cause the heaven to fall upon us piecemeal as thou hast pretended or bring allah and the angels as warrant or thou have house of gold or thou ascend up into heaven and even then we will put no faith in thine ascension till thou bring down for us book that we can read say muhammad my lord be glorified am aught save mortal messenger and naught prevented mankind from believing when the guidance came unto them save that they said hath allah sent mortal as his messenger say if there were in the earth angels walking secure we had sent down for them from heaven an angel as messenger say allah sufficeth for witness between me and you lo he is knower seer of his slaves and he whom allah guideth he is led aright while as for him whom he sendeth astray for them thou wilt find no protecting friends beside him and we shall assemble them on the day of resurrection on their faces blind dumb and deaf their habitation will be hell whenever it abateth we increase the flame for them that is their reward because they disbelieved our revelations and said when we are bones and fragments shall we forsooth be raised up as new creation have they not seen that allah who created the heavens and the earth is able to create the like of them and hath appointed for them an end whereof there is no doubt but the wrong doers refuse aught save disbelief say unto them if ye possessed the treasures of the mercy of my lord ye would surely hold them back for fear of spending for man was ever grudging and verily we gave unto moses nine tokens clear proofs of allah sovereignty do but ask the children of israel how he came unto them then pharaoh said unto him lo deem thee one bewitched moses he said in truth thou knowest that none sent down these portents save the lord of the heavens and the earth as proofs and lo for my part deem thee lost pharaoh and he wished to scare them from the land but we drowned him and those with him all together and we said unto the children of israel after him dwell in the land but when the promise of the hereafter cometh to pass we shall bring you as crowd gathered out of various nations with truth have we sent it down and with truth hath it descended and we have sent thee as naught else save bearer of good tidings and warner and it is qur an that we have divided that thou mayst recite it unto mankind at intervals and we have revealed it by successive revelation say believe therein or believe not lo those who were given knowledge before it when it is read unto them fall down prostrate on their faces adoring saying glory to our lord verily the promise of our lord must be fulfilled they fall down on their faces weeping and it increaseth humility in them say unto mankind cry unto allah or cry unto the beneficent unto whichsoever ye cry it is the same his are the most beautiful names and thou muhammad be not loud voiced in thy worship nor yet silent therein but follow way between and say praise be to allah who hath not taken unto himself son and who hath no partner in the sovereignty nor hath he any protecting friend through dependence and magnify him with all magnificence sura al kahf the cave praise be to allah who hath revealed the scripture unto his slave and hath not placed therein any crookedness but hath made it straight to give warning of stern punishment from him and to bring unto the believers who do good works the news that theirs will be fair reward wherein they will abide for ever and to warn those who say allah hath chosen son thing whereof they have no knowledge nor had their fathers dreadful is the word that cometh out of their mouths they speak naught but lie yet it may be if they believe not in this statement that thou muhammad wilt torment thy soul with grief over their footsteps lo we have placed all that is on the earth as an ornament thereof that we may try them which of them is best in conduct and lo we shall make all that is thereon barren mound or deemest thou that the people of the cave and the inscription are wonder among our portents when the young men fled for refuge to the cave and said our lord give us mercy from thy presence and shape for us right conduct in our plight then we sealed up their hearing in the cave for number of years and afterward we raised them up that we might know which of the two parties would best calculate the time that they had tarried we narrate unto thee their story with truth lo they were young men who believed in their lord and we increased them in guidance and we made firm their hearts when they stood forth and said our lord is the lord of the heavens and the earth we cry unto no allah beside him for then should we utter an enormity these our people have chosen other gods beside him though they bring no clear warrant vouchsafed to them and who doth greater wrong than he who inventeth lie concerning allah and when ye withdraw from them and that which they worship except allah then seek refuge in the cave your lord will spread for you of his mercy and will prepare for you pillow in your plight and thou mightest have seen the sun when it rose move away from their cave to the right and when it set go past them on the left and they were in the cleft thereof that was one of the portents of allah he whom allah guideth he indeed is led aright and he whom he sendeth astray for him thou wilt not find guiding friend and thou wouldst have deemed them waking though they were asleep and we caused them to turn over to the right and the left and their dog stretching out his paws on the threshold if thou hadst observed them closely thou hadst assuredly turned away from them in flight and hadst been filled with awe of them and in like manner we awakened them that they might question one another speaker from among them said how long have ye tarried they said we have tarried day or some part of day others said your lord best knoweth what ye have tarried now send one of you with this your silver coin unto the city and let him see what food is purest there and bring you supply thereof let him be courteous and let no man know of you for they if they should come to know of you will stone you or turn you back to their religion then ye will never prosper and in like manner we disclosed them to the people of the city that they might know that the promise of allah is true and that as for the hour there is no doubt concerning it when the people of the city disputed of their case among themselves they said build over them building their lord knoweth best concerning them those who won their point said we verily shall build place of worship over them some will say they were three their dog the fourth and some say five their dog the sixth guessing at random and some say seven and their dog the eighth say muhammad my lord is best aware of their number none knoweth them save few so contend not concerning them except with an outward contending and ask not any of them to pronounce concerning them and say not of anything lo shall do that tomorrow except if allah will and remember thy lord when thou forgettest and say it may be that my lord guideth me unto nearer way of truth than this and it is said they tarried in their cave three hundred years and add nine say allah is best aware how long they tarried his is the invisible of the heavens and the earth how clear of sight is he and keen of hearing they have no protecting friend beside him and he maketh none to share in his government and recite that which hath been revealed unto thee of the scripture of thy lord there is none who can change his words and thou wilt find no refuge beside him restrain thyself along with those who cry unto their lord at morn and evening seeking his countenance and let not thine eyes overlook them desiring the pomp of the life of the world and obey not him whose heart we have made heedless of our remembrance who followeth his own lust and whose case hath been abandoned say it is the truth from the lord of you all then whosoever will let him believe and whosoever will let him disbelieve lo we have prepared for disbelievers fire its tent encloseth them if they ask for showers they will be showered with water like to molten lead which burneth the faces calamitous the drink and ill the resting place lo as for those who believe and do good works lo we suffer not the reward of one whose work is goodly to be lost as for such theirs will be gardens of eden wherein rivers flow beneath them therein they will be given armlets of gold and will wear green robes of finest silk and gold embroidery reclining upon throne therein blest the reward and fair the resting place coin for them similitude two men unto one of whom we had assigned two gardens of grapes and we had surrounded both with date palms and had put between them tillage each of the gardens gave its fruit and withheld naught thereof and we caused river to gush forth therein and he had fruit and he said unto his comrade when he spake with him am more than thee in wealth and stronger in respect of men and he went into his garden while he thus wronged himself he said think not that all this will ever perish think not that the hour will ever come and if indeed am brought back unto my lord surely shall find better than this as resort his comrade when he thus spake with him exclaimed disbelievest thou in him who created thee of dust then of drop of seed and then fashioned thee man but he is allah my lord and ascribe unto my lord no partner if only when thou enteredst thy garden thou hadst said that which allah willeth will come to pass there is no strength save in allah though thou seest me as less than thee in wealth and children yet it may be that my lord will give me better than thy garden and will send on it bolt from heaven and some morning it will be smooth hillside or some morning the water thereof will be lost in the earth so that thou canst not make search for it and his fruit was beset with destruction then began he to wring his hands for all that he had spent upon it when now it was all ruined on its trellises and to say would that had ascribed no partner to my lord and he had no troop of men to help him as against allah nor could he save himself in this case is protection only from allah the true he is best for reward and best for consequence and coin for them the similitude of the life of the world as water which we send down from the sky and the vegetation of the earth mingleth with it and then becometh dry twigs that the winds scatter allah is able to do all things wealth and children are an ornament of the life of the world but the good deeds which endure are better in thy lord sight for reward and better in respect of hope and bethink you of the day when we remove the hills and ye see the earth emerging and we gather them together so as to leave not one of them behind and they are set before thy lord in ranks and it is said unto them now verily have ye come unto us as we created you at the first but ye thought that we had set no tryst for you and the book is placed and thou seest the guilty fearful of that which is therein and they say what kind of book is this that leaveth not small thing nor great thing but hath counted it and they find all that they did confronting them and thy lord wrongeth no one and remember when we said unto the angels fall prostrate before adam and they fell prostrate all save iblis he was of the jinn so he rebelled against his lord command will ye choose him and his seed for your protecting friends instead of me when they are an enemy unto you calamitous is the exchange for evil doers made them not to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth nor their own creation nor choose misleaders for my helpers and be mindful of the day when he will say call those partners of mine whom ye pretended then they will cry unto them but they will not hear their prayer and we shall set gulf of doom between them and the guilty behold the fire and know that they are about to fall therein and they find no way of escape thence and verily we have displayed for mankind in this qur an all manner of similitudes but man is more than anything contentious and naught hindereth mankind from believing when the guidance cometh unto them and from asking forgiveness of their lord unless it be that they wish that the judgment of the men of old should come upon them or that they should be confronted with the doom we send not the messengers save as bearers of good news and warners those who disbelieve contend with falsehood in order to refute the truth thereby and they take our revelations and that wherewith they are threatened as jest and who doth greater wrong than he who hath been reminded of the revelations of his lord yet turneth away from them and forgetteth what his hands send forward to the judgment lo on their hearts we have placed coverings so that they understand not and in their ears deafness and though thou call them to the guidance in that case they can never be led aright thy lord is the forgiver full of mercy if he took them to task now for what they earn he would hasten on the doom for them but theirs is an appointed term from which they will find no escape and all those townships we destroyed them when they did wrong and we appointed fixed time for their destruction and when moses said unto his servant will not give up until reach the point where the two rivers meet though march on for ages and when they reached the point where the two met they forgot their fish and it took its way into the waters being free and when they had gone further he said unto his servant bring us our breakfast verily we have found fatigue in this our journey he said didst thou see when we took refuge on the rock and forgot the fish and none but satan caused me to forget to mention it it took its way into the waters by marvel he said this is that which we have been seeking so they retraced their steps again then found they one of our slaves unto whom we had given mercy from us and had taught him knowledge from our presence moses said unto him may follow thee to the end that thou mayst teach me right conduct of that which thou hast been taught he said lo thou canst not bear with me how canst thou bear with that whereof thou canst not compass any knowledge he said allah willing thou shalt find me patient and shall not in aught gainsay thee he said well if thou go with me ask me not concerning aught till myself make mention of it unto thee so they twain set out till when they were in the ship he made hole therein moses said hast thou made hole therein to drown the folk thereof thou verily hast done dreadful thing he said did not tell thee that thou couldst not bear with me moses said be not wroth with me that forgot and be not hard upon me for my fault so they twain journeyed on till when they met lad he slew him moses said what hast thou slain an innocent soul who hath slain no man verily thou hast done horrid thing he said did not tell thee that thou couldst not bear with me moses said if ask thee after this concerning aught keep not company with me thou hast received an excuse from me so they twain journeyed on till when they came unto the folk of certain township they asked its folk for food but they refused to make them guests and they found therein wall upon the point of falling into ruin and he repaired it moses said if thou hadst wished thou couldst have taken payment for it he said this is the parting between thee and me will announce unto thee the interpretation of that thou couldst not bear with patience as for the ship it belonged to poor people working on the river and wished to mar it for there was king behind them who is taking every ship by force and as for the lad his parents were believers and we feared lest he should oppress them by rebellion and disbelief and we intended that their lord should change him for them for one better in purity and nearer to mercy and as for the wall it belonged to two orphan boys in the city and there was beneath it treasure belonging to them and their father had been righteous and thy lord intended that they should come to their full strength and should bring forth their treasure as mercy from their lord and did it not upon my own command such is the interpretation of that wherewith thou couldst not bear they will ask thee of dhu qarneyn say shall recite unto you remembrance of him lo we made him strong in the land and gave him unto every thing road and he followed road till when he reached the setting place of the sun he found it setting in muddy spring and found people thereabout we said dhu qarneyn either punish or show them kindness he said as for him who doeth wrong we shall punish him and then he will be brought back unto his lord who will punish him with awful punishment but as for him who believeth and doeth right good will be his reward and we shall speak unto him mild command then he followed road till when he reached the rising place of the sun he found it rising on people for whom we had appointed no shelter therefrom so it was and we knew all concerning him then he followed road till when he came between the two mountains he found upon their hither side folk that scarce could understand saying they said dhu qarneyn lo gog and magog are spoiling the land so may we pay thee tribute on condition that thou set barrier between us and them he said that wherein my lord hath established me is better than your tribute do but help me with strength of men will set between you and them bank give me pieces of iron till when he had levelled up the gap between the cliffs he said blow till when he had made it fire he said bring me molten copper to pour thereon and gog and magog were not able to surmount nor could they pierce it he said this is mercy from my lord but when the promise of my lord cometh to pass he will lay it low for the promise of my lord is true and on that day we shall let some of them surge against others and the trumpet will be blown then we shall gather them together in one gathering on that day we shall present hell to the disbelievers plain to view those whose eyes were hoodwinked from my reminder and who could not bear to hear do the disbelievers reckon that they can choose my bondmen as protecting friends beside me lo we have prepared hell as welcome for the disbelievers say shall we inform you who will be the greatest losers by their works those whose effort goeth astray in the life of the world and yet they reckon that they do good work those are they who disbelieve in the revelations of their lord and in the meeting with him therefor their works are vain and on the day of resurrection we assign no weight to them that is their reward hell because they disbelieved and made jest of our revelations and our messengers lo those who believe and do good works theirs are the gardens of paradise for welcome wherein they will abide with no desire to be removed from thence say though the sea became ink for the words of my lord verily the sea would be used up before the words of my lord were exhausted even though we brought the like thereof to help say am only mortal like you my lord inspireth in me that your allah is only one allah and whoever hopeth for the meeting with his lord let him do righteous work and make none sharer of the worship due unto his lord sura maryam mary kaf ha ya in sad mention of the mercy of thy lord unto his servant zachariah when he cried unto his lord cry in secret saying my lord lo the bones of me wax feeble and my head is shining with grey hair and have never been unblest in prayer to thee my lord lo fear my kinsfolk after me since my wife is barren oh give me from thy presence successor who shall inherit of me and inherit also of the house of jacob and make him my lord acceptable unto thee it was said unto him zachariah lo we bring thee tidings of son whose name is john we have given the same name to none before him he said my lord how can have son when my wife is barren and have reached infirm old age he said so it will be thy lord saith it is easy for me even as created thee before when thou wast naught he said my lord appoint for me some token he said thy token is that thou with no bodily defect shalt not speak unto mankind three nights then he came forth unto his people from the sanctuary and signified to them glorify your lord at break of day and fall of night and it was said unto his son john hold fast the scripture and we gave him wisdom when child and compassion from our presence and purity and he was devout and dutiful toward his parents and he was not arrogant rebellious peace on him the day he was born and the day he dieth and the day he shall be raised alive and make mention of mary in the scripture when she had withdrawn from her people to chamber looking east and had chosen seclusion from them then we sent unto her our spirit and it assumed for her the likeness of perfect man she said lo seek refuge in the beneficent one from thee if thou art allah fearing he said am only messenger of thy lord that may bestow on thee faultless son she said how can have son when no mortal hath touched me neither have been unchaste he said so it will be thy lord saith it is easy for me and it will be that we may make of him revelation for mankind and mercy from us and it is thing ordained and she conceived him and she withdrew with him to far place and the pangs of childbirth drove her unto the trunk of the palm tree she said oh would that had died ere this and had become thing of naught forgotten then one cried unto her from below her saying grieve not thy lord hath placed rivulet beneath thee and shake the trunk of the palm tree toward thee thou wilt cause ripe dates to fall upon thee so eat and drink and be consoled and if thou meetest any mortal say lo have vowed fast unto the beneficent and may not speak this day to any mortal then she brought him to her own folk carrying him they said mary thou hast come with an amazing thing sister of aaron thy father was not wicked man nor was thy mother harlot then she pointed to him they said how can we talk to one who is in the cradle young boy he spake lo am the slave of allah he hath given me the scripture and hath appointed me prophet and hath made me blessed wheresoever may be and hath enjoined upon me prayer and almsgiving so long as remain alive and hath made me dutiful toward her who bore me and hath not made me arrogant unblest peace on me the day was born and the day die and the day shall be raised alive such was jesus son of mary this is statement of the truth concerning which they doubt it befitteth not the majesty of allah that he should take unto himself son glory be to him when he decreeth thing he saith unto it only be and it is and lo allah is my lord and your lord so serve him that is the right path the sects among them differ but woe unto the disbelievers from the meeting of an awful day see and hear them on the day they come unto us yet the evil doers are today in error manifest and warn them of the day of anguish when the case hath been decided now they are in state of carelessness and they believe not lo we only we inherit the earth and all who are thereon and unto us they are returned and make mention muhammad in the scripture of abraham lo he was saint prophet when he said unto his father my father why worshippest thou that which heareth not nor seeth nor can in aught avail thee my father lo there hath come unto me of knowledge that which came not unto thee so follow me and will lead thee on right path my father serve not the devil lo the devil is rebel unto the beneficent my father lo fear lest punishment from the beneficent overtake thee so that thou become comrade of the devil he said rejectest thou my gods abraham if thou cease not shall surely stone thee depart from me long while he said peace be unto thee shall ask forgiveness of my lord for thee lo he was ever gracious unto me shall withdraw from you and that unto which ye pray beside allah and shall pray unto my lord it may be that in prayer unto my lord shall not be unblest so when he had withdrawn from them and that which they were worshipping beside allah we gave him isaac and jacob each of them we made prophet and we gave them of our mercy and assigned to them high and true renown and make mention in the scripture of moses lo he was chosen and he was messenger of allah prophet we called him from the right slope of the mount and brought him nigh in communion and we bestowed upon him of our mercy his brother aaron prophet likewise and make mention in the scripture of ishmael lo he was keeper of his promise and he was messenger of allah prophet he enjoined upon his people worship and almsgiving and was acceptable in the sight of his lord and make mention in the scripture of idris lo he was saint prophet and we raised him to high station these are they unto whom allah showed favour from among the prophets of the seed of adam and of those whom we carried in the ship with noah and of the seed of abraham and israel and from among those whom we guided and chose when the revelations of the beneficent were recited unto them they fell down adoring and weeping now there hath succeeded them later generation whom have ruined worship and have followed lusts but they will meet deception save him who shall repent and believe and do right such will enter the garden and they will not be wronged in aught gardens of eden which the beneficent hath promised to his slaves in the unseen lo his promise is ever sure of fulfilment they hear therein no idle talk but only peace and therein they have food for morn and evening such is the garden which we cause the devout among our bondmen to inherit we angels come not down save by commandment of thy lord unto him belongeth all that is before us and all that is behind us and all that is between those two and thy lord was never forgetful lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them therefor worship thou him and be thou steadfast in his service knowest thou one that can be named along with him and man saith when am dead shall forsooth be brought forth alive doth not man remember that we created him before when he was naught and by thy lord verily we shall assemble them and the devils then we shall bring them crouching around hell then we shall pluck out from every sect whichever of them was most stubborn in rebellion to the beneficent and surely we are best aware of those most worthy to be burned therein there is not one of you but shall approach it that is fixed ordinance of thy lord then we shall rescue those who kept from evil and leave the evil doers crouching there and when our clear revelations are recited unto them those who disbelieve say unto those who believe which of the two parties yours or ours is better in position and more imposing as an army how many generation have we destroyed before them who were more imposing in respect of gear and outward seeming say as for him who is in error the beneficent will verily prolong his span of life until when they behold that which they were promised whether it be punishment in the world or the hour of doom they will know who is worse in position and who is weaker as an army allah increaseth in right guidance those who walk aright and the good deeds which endure are better in thy lord sight for reward and better for resort hast thou seen him who disbelieveth in our revelations and saith assuredly shall be given wealth and children hath he perused the unseen or hath he made pact with the beneficent nay but we shall record that which he saith and prolong for him span of torment and we shall inherit from him that whereof he spake and he will come unto us alone without his wealth and children and they have chosen other gods beside allah that they may be power for them nay but they will deny their worship of them and become opponents unto them seest thou not that we have set the devils on the disbelievers to confound them with confusion so make no haste against them muhammad we do but number unto them sum of days on the day when we shall gather the righteous unto the beneficent goodly company and drive the guilty unto hell weary herd they will have no power of intercession save him who hath made covenant with his lord and they say the beneficent hath taken unto himself son assuredly ye utter disastrous thing whereby almost the heavens are torn and the earth is split asunder and the mountains fall in ruins that ye ascribe unto the beneficent son when it is not meet for the majesty of the beneficent that he should choose son there is none in the heavens and the earth but cometh unto the beneficent as slave verily he knoweth them and numbereth them with right numbering and each one of them will come unto him on the day of resurrection alone lo those who believe and do good works the beneficent will appoint for them love and we make this scripture easy in thy tongue muhammad only that thou mayst bear good tidings therewith unto those who ward off evil and warn therewith the froward folk and how many generation before them have we destroyed canst thou muhammad see single man of them or hear from them the slightest sound sura ta ha ta ha ta ha we have not revealed unto thee muhammad this qur an that thou shouldst be distressed but as reminder unto him who feareth revelation from him who created the earth and the high heavens the beneficent one who is established on the throne unto him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth and whatsoever is between them and whatsoever is beneath the sod and if thou speakest aloud then lo he knoweth the secret thought and that which is yet more hidden allah there is no allah save him his are the most beautiful names hath there come unto thee the story of moses when he saw fire and said unto his folk lo wait see fire afar off peradventure may bring you brand therefrom or may find guidance at the fire and when he reached it he was called by name moses lo even am thy lord so take off thy shoes for lo thou art in the holy valley of tuwa and have chosen thee so hearken unto that which is inspired lo even am allah there is no allah save me so serve me and establish worship for my remembrance lo the hour is surely coming but will to keep it hidden that every soul may be rewarded for that which it striveth to achieve therefor let not him turn thee aside from the thought of it who believeth not therein but followeth his own desire lest thou perish and what is that in thy right hand moses he said this is my staff whereon lean and wherewith bear down branches for my sheep and wherein find other uses he said cast it down moses so he cast it down and lo it was serpent gliding he said grasp it and fear not we shall return it to its former state and thrust thy hand within thine armpit it will come forth white without hurt that will be another token that we may show thee some of our greater portents go thou unto pharaoh lo he hath transgressed the bounds moses said my lord relieve my mind and ease my task for me and loose knot from my tongue that they may understand my saying appoint for me henchman from my folk aaron my brother confirm my strength with him and let him share my task that we may glorify thee much and much remember thee lo thou art ever seeing us he said thou art granted thy request moses and indeed another time already we have shown thee favour when we inspired in thy mother that which is inspired saying throw him into the ark and throw it into the river then the river shall throw it on to the bank and there an enemy to me and an enemy to him shall take him and endued thee with love from me that thou mightest be trained according to my will when thy sister went and said shall show you one who will nurse him and we restored thee to thy mother that her eyes might be refreshed and might not sorrow and thou didst kill man and we delivered thee from great distress and tried thee with heavy trial and thou didst tarry years among the folk of midian then camest thou hither by my providence moses and have attached thee to myself go thou and thy brother with my tokens and be not faint in remembrance of me go both of you unto pharaoh lo he hath transgressed the bounds and speak unto him gentle word that peradventure he may heed or fear they said our lord lo we fear that he may be beforehand with us or that he may play the tyrant he said fear not lo am with you twain hearing and seeing so go ye unto him and say lo we are two messengers of thy lord so let the children of israel go with us and torment them not we bring thee token from thy lord and peace will be for him who followeth right guidance lo it hath been revealed unto us that the doom will be for him who denieth and turneth away pharaoh said who then is the lord of you twain moses he said our lord is he who gave unto everything its nature then guided it aright he said what then is the state of the generations of old he said the knowledge thereof is with my lord in record my lord neither erreth nor forgetteth who hath appointed the earth as bed and hath threaded roads for you therein and hath sent down water from the sky and thereby we have brought forth divers kinds of vegetation saying eat ye and feed your cattle lo herein verily are portents for men of thought thereof we created you and thereunto we return you and thence we bring you forth second time and we verily did show him all our tokens but he denied them and refused he said hast come to drive us out from our land by thy magic moses but we surely can produce for thee magic the like thereof so appoint tryst between us and you which neither we nor thou shall fail to keep at place convenient to us both moses said your tryst shall be the day of the feast and let the people assemble when the sun hath risen high then pharaoh went and gathered his strength then came to the appointed tryst moses said unto them woe unto you invent not lie against allah lest he extirpate you by some punishment he who lieth faileth miserably then they debated one with another what they must do and they kept their counsel secret they said lo these are two wizards who would drive you out from your country by their magic and destroy your best traditions so arrange your plan and come in battle line whoso is uppermost this day will be indeed successful they said moses either throw first or let us be the first to throw he said nay do ye throw then lo their cords and their staves by their magic appeared to him as though they ran and moses conceived fear in his mind we said fear not lo thou art the higher throw that which is in thy right hand it will eat up that which they have made lo that which they have made is but wizard artifice and wizard shall not be successful to whatever point of skill he may attain then the wizards were all flung down prostrate crying we believe in the lord of aaron and moses pharaoh said ye put faith in him before give you leave lo he is your chief who taught you magic now surely shall cut off your hands and your feet alternately and shall crucify you on the trunks of palm trees and ye shall know for certain which of us hath sterner and more lasting punishment they said we choose thee not above the clear proofs that have come unto us and above him who created us so decree what thou wilt decree thou wilt end for us only this life of the world lo we believe in our lord that he may forgive us our sins and the magic unto which thou didst force us allah is better and more lasting lo whoso cometh guilty unto his lord verily for him is hell there he will neither die nor live but whoso cometh unto him believer having done good works for such are the high stations gardens of eden underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide for ever that is the reward of him who groweth and verily we inspired moses saying take away my slaves by night and strike for them dry path in the sea fearing not to be overtaken neither being afraid of the sea then pharaoh followed them with his hosts and there covered them that which did cover them of the sea and pharaoh led his folk astray he did not guide them children of israel we delivered you from your enemy and we made covenant with you on the holy mountain side and sent down on you the manna and the quails saying eat of the good things wherewith we have provided you and transgress not in respect thereof lest my wrath come upon you and he on whom my wrath cometh he is lost indeed and lo verily am forgiving toward him who repenteth and believeth and doeth good and afterward walketh aright and it was said what hath made thee hasten from thy folk moses he said they are close upon my track hastened unto thee my lord that thou mightest be well pleased he said lo we have tried thy folk in thine absence and as samiri hath misled them then moses went back unto his folk angry and sad he said my people hath not your lord promised you fair promise did the time appointed then appear too long for you or did ye wish that wrath from your lord should come upon you that ye broke tryst with me they said we broke not tryst with thee of our own will but we were laden with burdens of ornaments of the folk then cast them in the fire for thus as samiri proposed then he produced for them calf of saffron hue which gave forth lowing sound and they cried this is your god and the god of moses but he hath forgotten see they not then that it returneth no saying unto them and possesseth for them neither hurt nor use and aaron indeed had told them beforehand my people ye are but being seduced therewith for lo your lord is the beneficent so follow me and obey my order they said we shall by no means cease to be its votaries till moses return unto us he moses said aaron what held thee back when thou didst see them gone astray that thou followedst me not hast thou then disobeyed my order he said son of my mother clutch not my beard nor my head feared lest thou shouldst say thou hast caused division among the children of israel and hast not waited for my word moses said and what hast thou to say samiri he said perceived what they perceive not so seized handful from the footsteps of the messenger and then threw it in thus my soul commended to me moses said then go and lo in this life it is for thee to say touch me not and lo there is for thee tryst thou canst not break now look upon thy god of which thou hast remained votary verily we will burn it and will scatter its dust over the sea your allah is only allah than whom there is no other allah he embraceth all things in his knowledge thus relate we unto thee muhammad some tidings of that which happened of old and we have given thee from our presence reminder whoso turneth away from it he verily will bear burden on the day of resurrection abiding under it an evil burden for them on the day of resurrection the day when the trumpet is blown on that day we assemble the guilty white eyed with terror murmuring among themselves ye have tarried but ten days we are best aware of what they utter when their best in conduct say ye have tarried but day they will ask thee of the mountains on that day say my lord will break them into scattered dust and leave it as an empty plain wherein thou seest neither curve nor ruggedness on that day they follow the summoner who deceiveth not and voices are hushed for the beneficent and thou hearest but faint murmur on that day no intercession availeth save that of him unto whom the beneficent hath given leave and whose word he accepteth he knoweth all that is before them and all that is behind them while they cannot compass it in knowledge and faces humble themselves before the living the eternal and he who beareth burden of wrongdoing is indeed failure on that day and he who hath done some good works being believer he feareth not injustice nor begrudging of his wage thus we have revealed it as lecture in arabic and have displayed therein certain threats that peradventure they may keep from evil or that it may cause them to take heed then exalted be allah the true king and hasten not muhammad with the qur an ere its revelation hath been perfected unto thee and say my lord increase me in knowledge and verily we made covenant of old with adam but he forgot and we found no constancy in him and when we said unto the angels fall prostrate before adam they fell prostrate all save iblis he refused therefor we said adam this is an enemy unto thee and unto thy wife so let him not drive you both out of the garden so that thou come to toil it is vouchsafed unto thee that thou hungerest not therein nor art naked and that thou thirstest not therein nor art exposed to the sun heat but the devil whispered to him saying adam shall show thee the tree of immortality and power that wasteth not away then they twain ate thereof so that their shame became apparent unto them and they began to hide by heaping on themselves some of the leaves of the garden and adam disobeyed his lord so went astray then his lord chose him and relented toward him and guided him he said go down hence both of you one of you foe unto the other but when there come unto you from me guidance then whoso followeth my guidance he will not go astray nor come to grief but he who turneth away from remembrance of me his will be narrow life and shall bring him blind to the assembly on the day of resurrection he will say my lord wherefor hast thou gathered me hither blind when was wont to see he will say so it must be our revelations came unto thee but thou didst forget them in like manner thou art forgotten this day thus do we reward him who is prodigal and believeth not the revelations of his lord and verily the doom of the hereafter will be sterner and more lasting is it not guidance for them to know how many generation we destroyed before them amid whose dwellings they walk lo therein verily are signs for men of thought and but for decree that had already gone forth from thy lord and term already fixed the judgment would have been inevitable in this world therefor muhammad bear with what they say and celebrate the praise of thy lord ere the rising of the sun and ere the going down thereof and glorify him some hours of the night and at the two ends of the day that thou mayst find acceptance and strain not thine eyes toward that which we cause some wedded pairs among them to enjoy the flower of the life of the world that we may try them thereby the provision of thy lord is better and more lasting and enjoin upon thy people worship and be constant therein we ask not of thee provision we provided for thee and the sequel is for righteousness and they say if only he would bring us miracle from his lord hath there not come unto them the proof of what is in the former scriptures and if we had destroyed them with some punishment before it they would assuredly have said our lord if only thou hadst sent unto us messenger so that we might have followed thy revelations before we were thus humbled and disgraced say each is awaiting so await ye ye will come to know who are the owners of the path of equity and who is right sura al anbiya the prophets their reckoning draweth nigh for mankind while they turn away in heedlessness never cometh there unto them new reminder from their lord but they listen to it while they play with hearts preoccupied and they confer in secret the wrong doers say is this other than mortal like you will ye then succumb to magic when ye see it he saith my lord knoweth what is spoken in the heaven and the earth he is the hearer the knower nay say they these are but muddled dreams nay he hath but invented it nay he is but poet let him bring us portent even as those of old who were allah messengers were sent with portents not township believed of those which we destroyed before them though we sent them portents would they then believe and we sent not as our messengers before thee other than men whom we inspired ask the followers of the reminder if ye know not we gave them not bodies that would not eat food nor were they immortals then we fulfilled the promise unto them so we delivered them and whom we would and we destroyed the prodigals now we have revealed unto you scripture wherein is your reminder have ye then no sense how many community that dealt unjustly have we shattered and raised up after them another folk and when they felt our might behold them fleeing from it but it was said unto them flee not but return to that existence which emasculated you and to your dwellings that ye may be questioned they cried alas for us we were wrong doers and this their crying ceased not till we made them as reaped corn extinct we created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them in play if we had wished to find pastime we could have found it in our presence if we ever did nay but we hurl the true against the false and it doth break its head and lo it vanisheth and yours will be woe for that which ye ascribe unto him unto him belongeth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and those who dwell in his presence are not too proud to worship him nor do they weary they glorify him night and day they flag not or have they chosen gods from the earth who raise the dead if there were therein gods beside allah then verily both the heavens and the earth had been disordered glorified be allah the lord of the throne from all that they ascribe unto him he will not be questioned as to that which he doeth but they will be questioned or have they chosen other gods beside him say bring your proof of their godhead this is the reminder of those with me and those before me but most of them know not the truth and so they are averse and we sent no messenger before thee but we inspired him saying there is no allah save me allah so worship me and they say the beneficent hath taken unto himself son be he glorified nay but those whom they call sons are honoured slaves they speak not until he hath spoken and they act by his command he knoweth what is before them and what is behind them and they cannot intercede except for him whom he accepteth and they quake for awe of him and one of them who should say lo am god beside him that one we should repay with hell thus we repay wrong doers have not those who disbelieve known that the heavens and the earth were of one piece then we parted them and we made every living thing of water will they not then believe and we have placed in the earth firm hills lest it quake with them and we have placed therein ravines as roads that haply they may find their way and we have made the sky roof withheld from them yet they turn away from its portents and he it is who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon they float each in an orbit we appointed immortality for no mortal before thee what if thou diest can they be immortal every soul must taste of death and we try you with evil and with good for ordeal and unto us ye will be returned and when those who disbelieve behold thee they but choose thee out for mockery saying is this he who maketh mention of your gods and they would deny all mention of the beneficent man is made of haste shall show you my portents but ask me not to hasten and they say when will this promise be fulfilled if ye are truthful if those who disbelieved but knew the time when they will not be able to drive off the fire from their faces and from their backs and they will not be helped nay but it will come upon them unawares so that it will stupefy them and they will be unable to repel it neither will they be reprieved messengers before thee indeed were mocked but that whereat they mocked surrounded those who scoffed at them say who guardeth you in the night or in the day from the beneficent nay but they turn away from mention of their lord or have they gods who can shield them from us they cannot help themselves nor can they be defended from us nay but we gave these and their fathers ease until life grew long for them see they not how we aim to the land reducing it of its outlying parts can they then be the victors say muhammad unto mankind warn you only by the inspiration but the deaf hear not the call when they are warned and if breath of thy lord punishment were to touch them they assuredly would say alas for us lo we were wrong doers and we set just balance for the day of resurrection so that no soul is wronged in aught though it be of the weight of grain of mustard seed we bring it and we suffice for reckoners and we verily gave moses and aaron the criterion of right and wrong and light and reminder for those who keep from evil those who fear their lord in secret and who dread the hour of doom this is blessed reminder that we have revealed will ye then reject it and we verily gave abraham of old his proper course and we were aware of him when he said unto his father and his folk what are these images unto which ye pay devotion they said we found our fathers worshippers of them he said verily ye and your fathers were in plain error they said bringest thou unto us the truth or art thou some jester he said nay but your lord is the lord of the heavens and the earth who created them and am of those who testify unto that and by allah shall circumvent your idols after ye have gone away and turned your backs then he reduced them to fragments all save the chief of them that haply they might have recourse to it they said who hath done this to our gods surely it must be some evil doer they said we heard youth make mention of them who is called abraham they said then bring him hither before the people eyes that they may testify they said is it thou who hast done this to our gods abraham he said but this their chief hath done it so question them if they can speak then gathered they apart and said lo ye yourselves are the wrong doers and they were utterly confounded and they said well thou knowest that these speak not he said worship ye then instead of allah that which cannot profit you at all nor harm you fie on you and all that ye worship instead of allah have ye then no sense they cried burn him and stand by your gods if ye will be doing we said fire be coolness and peace for abraham and they wished to set snare for him but we made them the greater losers and we rescued him and lot and brought them to the land which we have blessed for all peoples and we bestowed upon him isaac and jacob as grandson each of them we made righteous and we made them chiefs who guide by our command and we inspired in them the doing of good deeds and the right establishment of worship and the giving of alms and they were worshippers of us alone and unto lot we gave judgment and knowledge and we delivered him from the community that did abominations lo they were folk of evil lewd and we brought him in unto our mercy lo he was of the righteous and noah when he cried of old we heard his prayer and saved him and his household from the great affliction and delivered him from the people who denied our revelations lo they were folk of evil therefor did we drown them all and david and solomon when they gave judgment concerning the field when people sheep had strayed and browsed therein by night and we were witnesses to their judgment and we made solomon to understand the case and unto each of them we gave judgment and knowledge and we subdued the hills and the birds to hymn his praise along with david we were the doers thereof and we taught him the art of making garments of mail to protect you in your daring are ye then thankful and unto solomon we subdued the wind in its raging it set by his command toward the land which we had blessed and of everything we are aware and of the evil ones subdued we unto him some who dived for pearls for him and did other work and we were warders unto them and job when he cried unto his lord saying lo adversity afflicteth me and thou art most merciful of all who show mercy then we heard his prayer and removed that adversity from which he suffered and we gave him his household that he had lost and the like thereof along with them mercy from our store and remembrance for the worshippers and mention ishmael and idris and dhu kifl all were of the steadfast and we brought them in unto our mercy lo they are among the righteous and mention dhu nun when he went off in anger and deemed that we had no power over him but he cried out in the darkness saying there is no allah save thee be thou glorified lo have been wrong doer then we heard his prayer and saved him from the anguish thus we save believers and zachariah when he cried unto his lord my lord leave me not childless though thou art the best of inheritors then we heard his prayer and bestowed upon him john and adjusted his wife to bear child for him lo they used to vie one with the other in good deeds and they cried unto us in longing and in fear and were submissive unto us and she who was chaste therefor we breathed into her something of our spirit and made her and her son token for all peoples lo this your religion is one religion and am your lord so worship me and they have broken their religion into fragments among them yet all are returning unto us then whoso doeth some good works and is believer there will be no rejection of his effort lo we record it for him and there is ban upon any community which we have destroyed that they shall not return until when gog and magog are let loose and they hasten out of every mound and the true promise draweth nigh then behold them staring wide in terror the eyes of those who disbelieve they say alas for us we lived in forgetfulness of this ah but we were wrong doers lo ye idolaters and that which ye worship beside allah are fuel of hell thereunto ye will come if these had been gods they would not have come thither but all will abide therein therein wailing is their portion and therein they hear not lo those unto whom kindness hath gone forth before from us they will be far removed from thence they will not hear the slightest sound thereof while they abide in that which their souls desire the supreme horror will not grieve them and the angels will welcome them saying this is your day which ye were promised the day when we shall roll up the heavens as recorder rolleth up written scroll as we began the first creation we shall repeat it it is promise binding upon us lo we are to perform it and verily we have written in the scripture after the reminder my righteous slaves will inherit the earth lo there is plain statement for folk who are devout we sent thee not save as mercy for the peoples say it is only inspired in me that your allah is one allah will ye then surrender unto him but if they are averse then say have warned you all alike although know not whether nigh or far is that which ye are promised lo he knoweth that which is said openly and that which ye conceal and know not but that this may be trial for you and enjoyment for while he saith my lord judge thou with truth our lord is the beneficent whose help is to be implored against that which ye ascribe unto him sura al hajj the pilgrimage mankind fear your lord lo the earthquake of the hour of doom is tremendous thing on the day when ye behold it every nursing mother will forget her nursling and every pregnant one will be delivered of her burden and thou muhammad wilt see mankind as drunken yet they will not be drunken but the doom of allah will be strong upon them among mankind is he who disputeth concerning allah without knowledge and followeth each froward devil for him it is decreed that whoso taketh him for friend he verily will mislead him and will guide him to the punishment of the flame mankind if ye are in doubt concerning the resurrection then lo we have created you from dust then from drop of seed then from clot then from little lump of flesh shapely and shapeless that we may make it clear for you and we cause what we will to remain in the wombs for an appointed time and afterward we bring you forth as infants then give you growth that ye attain your full strength and among you there is he who dieth young and among you there is he who is brought back to the most abject time of life so that after knowledge he knoweth naught and thou muhammad seest the earth barren but when we send down water thereon it doth thrill and swell and put forth every lovely kind of growth that is because allah he is the truth and because he quickeneth the dead and because he is able to do all things and because the hour will come there is no doubt thereof and because allah will raise those who are in the graves and among mankind is he who disputeth concerning allah without knowledge or guidance or scripture giving light turning away in pride to beguile men from the way of allah for him in this world is ignominy and on the day of resurrection we make him taste the doom of burning and unto him it will be said this is for that which thy two hands have sent before and because allah is no oppressor of his slaves and among mankind is he who worshippeth allah upon narrow marge so that if good befalleth him he is content therewith but if trial befalleth him he falleth away utterly he loseth both the world and the hereafter that is the sheer loss he calleth beside allah unto that which hurteth him not nor benefiteth him that is the far error he calleth unto him whose harm is nearer than his benefit verily an evil patron and verily an evil friend lo allah causeth those who believe and do good works to enter gardens underneath which rivers flow lo allah doth what he intendeth whoso is wont to think through envy that allah will not give him muhammad victory in the world and the hereafter and is enraged at the thought of his victory let him stretch rope up to the roof of his dwelling and let him hang himself then let him see whether his strategy dispelleth that whereat he rageth thus we reveal it as plain revelations and verily allah guideth whom he will lo those who believe this revelation and those who are jews and the sabaeans and the christians and the magians and the idolaters lo allah will decide between them on the day of resurrection lo allah is witness over all things hast thou not seen that unto allah payeth adoration whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is in the earth and the sun and the moon and the stars and the hills and the trees and the beasts and many of mankind while there are many unto whom the doom is justly due he whom allah scorneth there is none to give him honour lo allah doeth what he will these twain the believers and the disbelievers are two opponents who contend concerning their lord but as for those who disbelieve garments of fire will be cut out for them boiling fluid will be poured down on their heads whereby that which is in their bellies and their skins too will be melted and for them are hooked rods of iron whenever in their anguish they would go forth from thence they are driven back therein and it is said unto them taste the doom of burning lo allah will cause those who believe and do good works to enter gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will be allowed armlets of gold and pearls and their raiment therein will be silk they are guided unto gentle speech they are guided unto the path of the glorious one lo those who disbelieve and bar men from the way of allah and from the inviolable place of worship which we have appointed for mankind together the dweller therein and the nomad whosoever seeketh wrongful partiality therein him we shall cause to taste painful doom and remember when we prepared for abraham the place of the holy house saying ascribe thou no thing as partner unto me and purify my house for those who make the round thereof and those who stand and those who bow and make prostration and proclaim unto mankind the pilgrimage they will come unto thee on foot and on every lean camel they will come from every deep ravine that they may witness things that are of benefit to them and mention the name of allah on appointed days over the beast of cattle that he hath bestowed upon them then eat thereof and feed therewith the poor unfortunate then let them make an end of their unkemptness and pay their vows and go around the ancient house that is the command and whoso magnifieth the sacred things of allah it will be well for him in the sight of his lord the cattle are lawful unto you save that which hath been told you so shun the filth of idols and shun lying speech turning unto allah only not ascribing partners unto him for whoso ascribeth partners unto allah it is as if he had fallen from the sky and the birds had snatched him or the wind had blown him to far off place that is the command and whoso magnifieth the offerings consecrated to allah it surely is from devotion of the hearts therein are benefits for you for an appointed term and afterward they are brought for sacrifice unto the ancient house and for every nation have we appointed ritual that they may mention the name of allah over the beast of cattle that he hath given them for food and your god is one god therefor surrender unto him and give good tidings muhammad to the humble whose hearts fear when allah is mentioned and the patient of whatever may befall them and those who establish worship and who spend of that we have bestowed on them and the camels we have appointed them among the ceremonies of allah therein ye have much good so mention the name of allah over them when they are drawn up in lines then when their flanks fall dead eat thereof and feed the beggar and the suppliant thus have we made them subject unto you that haply ye may give thanks their flesh and their food reach not allah but the devotion from you reacheth him thus have we made them subject unto you that ye may magnify allah that he hath guided you and give good tidings muhammad to the good lo allah defendeth those who are true lo allah loveth not each treacherous ingrate sanction is given unto those who fight because they have been wronged and allah is indeed able to give them victory those who have been driven from their homes unjustly only because they said our lord is allah for had it not been for allah repelling some men by means of others cloisters and churches and oratories and mosques wherein the name of allah is oft mentioned would assuredly have been pulled down verily allah helpeth one who helpeth him lo allah is strong almighty those who if we give them power in the land establish worship and pay the poor due and enjoin kindness and forbid iniquity and allah is the sequel of events if they deny thee muhammad even so the folk of noah and the tribes of ad and thamud before thee denied our messengers and the folk of abraham and the folk of lot and the dwellers in midian and moses was denied but indulged the disbelievers long while then seized them and how terrible was my abhorrence how many township have we destroyed while it was sinful so that it lieth to this day in ruins and how many deserted well and lofty tower have they not travelled in the land and have they hearts wherewith to feel and ears wherewith to hear for indeed it is not the eyes that grow blind but it is the hearts which are within the bosoms that grow blind and they will bid thee hasten on the doom and allah faileth not his promise but lo day with allah is as thousand years of what ye reckon and how many township did suffer long though it was sinful then grasped it unto me is the return say mankind am only plain warner unto you those who believe and do good works for them is pardon and rich provision while those who strive to thwart our revelations such are rightful owners of the fire never sent we messenger or prophet before thee but when he recited the message satan proposed opposition in respect of that which he recited thereof but allah abolisheth that which satan proposeth then allah establisheth his revelations allah is knower wise that he may make that which the devil proposeth temptation for those in whose hearts is disease and those whose hearts are hardened lo the evildoers are in open schism and that those who have been given knowledge may know that it is the truth from thy lord so that they may believe therein and their hearts may submit humbly unto him lo allah verily is guiding those who believe unto right path and those who disbelieve will not cease to be in doubt thereof until the hour come upon them unawares or there come unto them the doom of disastrous day the sovereignty on that day will be allah he will judge between them then those who believed and did good works will be in gardens of delight while those who disbelieved and denied our revelations for them will be shameful doom those who fled their homes for the cause of allah and then were slain or died allah verily will provide for them good provision lo allah he verily is best of all who make provision assuredly he will cause them to enter by an entry that they will love lo allah verily is knower indulgent that is so and whoso hath retaliated with the like of that which he was made to suffer and then hath again been wronged allah will succour him lo allah verily is mild forgiving that is because allah maketh the night to pass into the day and maketh the day to pass into the night and because allah is hearer seer that is because allah he is the true and that whereon they call instead of him it is the false and because allah he is the high the great seest thou not how allah sendeth down water from the sky and then the earth becometh green upon the morrow lo allah is subtile aware unto him belongeth all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth lo allah he verily is the absolute the owner of praise hast thou not seen how allah hath made all that is in the earth subservient unto you and the ship runneth upon the sea by his command and he holdeth back the heaven from falling on the earth unless by his leave lo allah is for mankind full of pity merciful and he it is who gave you life then he will cause you to die and then will give you life again lo man is verily an ingrate unto each nation have we given sacred rites which they are to perform so let them not dispute with thee of the matter but summon thou unto thy lord lo thou indeed followest right guidance and if they wrangle with thee say allah is best aware of what ye do allah will judge between you on the day of resurrection concerning that wherein ye used to differ hast thou not known that allah knoweth all that is in the heaven and the earth lo it is in record lo that is easy for allah and they worship instead of allah that for which he hath sent down no warrant and that whereof they have no knowledge for evil doers there is no helper and when our revelations are recited unto them thou knowest the denial in the faces of those who disbelieve they all but attack those who recite our revelations unto them say shall proclaim unto you worse than that the fire allah hath promised it for those who disbelieve hapless journey end mankind similitude is coined so pay ye heed to it lo those on whom ye call beside allah will never create fly though they combine together for the purpose and if the fly took something from them they could not rescue it from it so weak are both the seeker and the sought they measure not allah his rightful measure lo allah is strong almighty allah chooseth from the angels messengers and also from mankind lo allah is hearer seer he knoweth all that is before them and all that is behind them and unto allah all things are returned ye who believe bow down and prostrate yourselves and worship your lord and do good that haply ye may prosper and strive for allah with the endeavour which is his right he hath chosen you and hath not laid upon you in religion any hardship the faith of your father abraham is yours he hath named you muslims of old time and in this scripture that the messenger may be witness against you and that ye may be witnesses against mankind so establish worship pay the poor due and hold fast to allah he is your protecting friend blessed patron and blessed helper sura al mumenoon the believers successful indeed are the believers who are humble in their prayers and who shun vain conversation and who are payers of the poor due and who guard their modesty save from their wives or the slaves that their right hands possess for then they are not blameworthy but whoso craveth beyond that such are transgressors and who are shepherds of their pledge and their covenant and who pay heed to their prayers these are the heirs who will inherit paradise there they will abide verily we created man from product of wet earth then placed him as drop of seed in safe lodging then fashioned we the drop clot then fashioned we the clot little lump then fashioned we the little lump bones then clothed the bones with flesh and then produced it as another creation so blessed be allah the best of creators then lo after that ye surely die then lo on the day of resurrection ye are raised again and we have created above you seven paths and we are never unmindful of creation and we send down from the sky water in measure and we give it lodging in the earth and lo we are able to withdraw it then we produce for you therewith gardens of date palms and grapes wherein is much fruit for you and whereof ye eat and tree that springeth forth from mount sinai that groweth oil and relish for the eaters and lo in the cattle there is verily lesson for you we give you to drink of that which is in their bellies and many uses have ye in them and of them do ye eat and on them and on the ship ye are carried and we verily sent noah unto his folk and he said my people serve allah ye have no other allah save him will ye not ward off evil but the chieftains of his folk who disbelieved said this is only mortal like you who would make himself superior to you had allah willed he surely could have sent down angels we heard not of this in the case of our fathers of old he is only man in whom is madness so watch him for while he said my lord help me because they deny me then we inspired in him saying make the ship under our eyes and our inspiration then when our command cometh and the oven gusheth water introduce therein of every kind two spouses and thy household save him thereof against whom the word hath already gone forth and plead not with me on behalf of those who have done wrong lo they will be drowned and when thou art on board the ship thou and whoso is with thee then say praise be to allah who hath saved us from the wrongdoing folk and say my lord cause me to land at blessed landing place for thou art best of all who bring to land lo herein verily are portents for lo we are ever putting mankind to the test then after them we brought forth another generation and we sent among them messenger of their own saying serve allah ye have no other allah save him will ye not ward off evil and the chieftains of his folk who disbelieved and denied the meeting of the hereafter and whom we had made soft in the life of the world said this is only mortal like you who eateth of that whereof ye eat and drinketh of that ye drink if ye were to obey mortal like yourselves then lo ye surely would be losers doth he promise you that you when ye are dead and have become dust and bones will again be brought forth begone begone with that which ye are promised there is naught but our life of the world we die and we live and we shall not be raised again he is only man who hath invented lie about allah we are not going to put faith in him he said my lord help me because they deny me he said in little while they surely will become repentant so the awful cry overtook them rightfully and we made them like as wreckage that torrent hurleth far removal for wrongdoing folk then after them we brought forth other generations no nation can outstrip its term nor yet postpone it then we sent our messengers one after another whenever its messenger came unto nation they denied him so we caused them to follow one another to disaster and we made them bywords far removal for folk who believe not then we sent moses and his brother aaron with our tokens and clear warrant unto pharaoh and his chiefs but they scorned them and they were despotic folk and they said shall we put faith in two mortals like ourselves and whose folk are servile unto us so they denied them and became of those who were destroyed and we verily gave moses the scripture that haply they might go aright and we made the son of mary and his mother portent and we gave them refuge on height place of flocks and watersprings ye messengers eat of the good things and do right lo am aware of what ye do and lo this your religion is one religion and am your lord so keep your duty unto me but they mankind have broken their religion among them into sects each group rejoicing in its tenets so leave them in their error till time think they that in the wealth and sons wherewith we provide them we hasten unto them with good things nay but they perceive not lo those who go in awe for fear of their lord and those who believe in the revelations of their lord and those who ascribe not partners unto their lord and those who give that which they give with hearts afraid because they are about to return unto their lord these race for the good things and they shall win them in the race and we task not any soul beyond its scope and with us is record which speaketh the truth and they will not be wronged nay but their hearts are in ignorance of this qur an and they have other works besides which they are doing till when we grasp their luxurious ones with the punishment behold they supplicate supplicate not this day assuredly ye will not be helped by us my revelations were recited unto you but ye used to turn back on your heels in scorn thereof nightly did ye rave together have they not pondered the word or hath that come unto them which came not unto their fathers of old or know they not their messenger and so reject him or say they there is madness in him nay but he bringeth them the truth and most of them are haters of the truth and if the truth had followed their desires verily the heavens and the earth and whosoever is therein had been corrupted nay we have brought them their reminder but from their reminder they now turn away or dost thou ask of them muhammad any tribute but the bounty of thy lord is better for he is best of all who make provision and lo thou summonest them indeed unto straight path and lo those who believe not in the hereafter are indeed astray from the path though we had mercy on them and relieved them of the harm afflicting them they still would wander blindly on in their contumacy already have we grasped them with punishment but they humble not themselves unto their lord nor do they pray until when we open for them the gate of extreme punishment behold they are aghast thereat he it is who hath created for you ears and eyes and hearts small thanks give ye and he it is who hath sown you broadcast in the earth and unto him ye will be gathered and he it is who giveth life and causeth death and his is the difference of night and day have ye then no sense nay but they say the like of that which said the men of old they say when we are dead and have become mere dust and bones shall we then forsooth be raised again we were already promised this we and our forefathers lo this is naught but fables of the men of old say unto whom belongeth the earth and whosoever is therein if ye have knowledge they will say unto allah say will ye not then remember say who is lord of the seven heavens and lord of the tremendous throne they will say unto allah all that belongeth say will ye not then keep duty unto him say in whose hand is the dominion over all things and he protecteth while against him there is no protection if ye have knowledge they will say unto allah all that belongeth say how then are ye bewitched nay but we have brought them the truth and lo they are liars allah hath not chosen any son nor is there any god along with him else would each god have assuredly championed that which he created and some of them would assuredly have overcome others glorified be allah above all that they allege knower of the invisible and the visible and exalted be he over all that they ascribe as partners unto him say my lord if thou shouldst show me that which they are promised my lord then set me not among the wrongdoing folk and verily we are able to show thee that which we have promised them repel evil with that which is better we are best aware of that which they allege and say my lord seek refuge in thee from suggestions of the evil ones and seek refuge in thee my lord lest they be present with me until when death cometh unto one of them he saith my lord send me back that may do right in that which have left behind but nay it is but word that he speaketh and behind them is barrier until the day when they are raised and when the trumpet is blown there will be no kinship among them that day nor will they ask of one another then those whose scales are heavy they are the successful and those whose scales are light are those who lose their souls in hell abiding the fire burneth their faces and they are glum therein it will be said were not my revelations recited unto you and then ye used to deny them they will say our lord our evil fortune conquered us and we were erring folk our lord oh bring us forth from hence if we return to evil then indeed we shall be wrong doers he saith begone therein and speak not unto me lo there was party of my slaves who said our lord we believe therefor forgive us and have mercy on us for thou art best of all who show mercy but ye chose them for laughing stock until they caused you to forget remembrance of me while ye laughed at them lo have rewarded them this day forasmuch as they were steadfast in that they even they are the triumphant he will say how long tarried ye in the earth counting by years they will say we tarried by day or part of day ask of those who keep count he will say ye tarried but little if ye only knew deemed ye then that we had created you for naught and that ye would not be returned unto us now allah be exalted the true king there is no allah save him the lord of the throne of grace he who crieth unto any other god along with allah hath no proof thereof his reckoning is only with his lord lo disbelievers will not be successful and muhammad say my lord forgive and have mercy for thou art best of all who show mercy sura an noor the light here is surah which we have revealed and enjoined and wherein we have revealed plain tokens that haply ye may take heed the adulterer and the adulteress scourge ye each one of them with hundred stripes and let not pity for the twain withhold you from obedience to allah if ye believe in allah and the last day and let party of believers witness their punishment the adulterer shall not marry save an adulteress or an idolatress and the adulteress none shall marry save an adulterer or an idolater all that is forbidden unto believers and those who accuse honourable women but bring not four witnesses scourge them with eighty stripes and never afterward accept their testimony they indeed are evil doers save those who afterward repent and make amends for such lo allah is forgiving merciful as for those who accuse their wives but have no witnesses except themselves let the testimony of one of them be four testimonies swearing by allah that he is of those who speak the truth and yet fifth invoking the curse of allah on him if he is of those who lie and it shall avert the punishment from her if she bear witness before allah four times that the thing he saith is indeed false and fifth time that the wrath of allah be upon her if he speaketh truth and had it not been for the grace of allah and his mercy unto you and that allah is clement wise ye had been undone lo they who spread the slander are gang among you deem it not bad thing for you nay it is good for you unto every man of them will be paid that which he hath earned of the sin and as for him among them who had the greater share therein his will be an awful doom why did not the believers men and women when ye heard it think good of their own own folk and say it is manifest untruth why did they not produce four witnesses since they produce not witnesses they verily are liars in the sight of allah had it not been for the grace of allah and his mercy unto you in the world and the hereafter an awful doom had overtaken you for that whereof ye murmured when ye welcomed it with your tongues and uttered with your mouths that whereof ye had no knowledge ye counted it trifle in the sight of allah it is very great wherefor when ye heard it said ye not it is not for us to speak of this glory be to thee allah this is awful calumny allah admonisheth you that ye repeat not the like thereof ever if ye are in truth believers and he expoundeth unto you the revelations allah is knower wise lo those who love that slander should be spread concerning those who believe theirs will be painful punishment in the world and the hereafter allah knoweth ye know not had it not been for the grace of allah and his mercy unto you and that allah is clement merciful ye had been undone ye who believe follow not the footsteps of the devil unto whomsoever followeth the footsteps of the devil lo he commandeth filthiness and wrong had it not been for the grace of allah and his mercy unto you not one of you would ever have grown pure but allah causeth whom he will to grow and allah is hearer knower and let not those who possess dignity and ease among you swear not to give to the near of kin and to the needy and to fugitives for the cause of allah let them forgive and show indulgence yearn ye not that allah may forgive you allah is forgiving merciful lo as for those who traduce virtuous believing women who are careless cursed are they in the world and the hereafter theirs will be an awful doom on the day when their tongues and their hands and their feet testify against them as to what they used to do on that day allah will pay them their just due and they will know that allah he is the manifest truth vile women are for vile men and vile men for vile women good women are for good men and good men for good women such are innocent of that which people say for them is pardon and bountiful provision ye who believe enter not houses other than your own without first announcing your presence and invoking peace upon the folk thereof that is better for you that ye may be heedful and if ye find no one therein still enter not until permission hath been given and if it be said unto you go away again then go away for it is purer for you allah knoweth what ye do it is no sin for you to enter uninhabited houses wherein is comfort for you allah knoweth what ye proclaim and what ye hide tell the believing men to lower their gaze and be modest that is purer for them lo allah is aware of what they do and tell the believing women to lower their gaze and be modest and to display of their adornment only that which is apparent and to draw their veils over their bosoms and not to reveal their adornment save to their own husbands or fathers or husbands fathers or their sons or their husbands sons or their brothers or their brothers sons or sisters sons or their women or their slaves or male attendants who lack vigour or children who know naught of women nakedness and let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment and turn unto allah together believers in order that ye may succeed and marry such of you as are solitary and the pious of your slaves and maidservants if they be poor allah will enrich them of his bounty allah is of ample means aware and let those who cannot find match keep chaste till allah give them independence by his grace and such of your slaves as seek writing of emancipation write it for them if ye are aware of aught of good in them and bestow upon them of the wealth of allah which he hath bestowed upon you force not your slave girls to whoredom that ye may seek enjoyment of the life of the world if they would preserve their chastity and if one force them then unto them after their compulsion lo allah will be forgiving merciful and verily we have sent down for you revelations that make plain and the example of those who passed away before you an admonition unto those who ward off evil allah is the light of the heavens and the earth the similitude of his light is as niche wherein is lamp the lamp is in glass the glass is as it were shining star this lamp is kindled from blessed tree an olive neither of the east nor of the west whose oil would almost glow forth of itself though no fire touched it light upon light allah guideth unto his light whom he will and allah speaketh to mankind in allegories for allah is knower of all things this lamp is found in houses which allah hath allowed to be exalted and that his name shall be remembered therein therein do offer praise to him at morn and evening men whom neither merchandise nor sale beguileth from remembrance of allah and constancy in prayer and paying to the poor their due who fear day when hearts and eyeballs will be overturned that allah may reward them with the best of what they did and increase reward for them of his bounty allah giveth blessings without stint to whom he will as for those who disbelieve their deeds are as mirage in desert the thirsty one supposeth it to be water till he cometh unto it and findeth it naught and findeth in the place thereof allah who payeth him his due and allah is swift at reckoning or as darkness on vast abysmal sea there covereth him wave above which is wave above which is cloud layer upon layer of darkness when he holdeth out his hand he scarce can see it and he for whom allah hath not appointed light for him there is no light hast thou not seen that allah he it is whom all who are in the heavens and the earth praise and the birds in their flight of each he knoweth verily the worship and the praise and allah is aware of what they do and unto allah belongeth the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and unto allah is the journeying hast thou not seen how allah wafteth the clouds then gathereth them then maketh them layers and thou seest the rain come forth from between them he sendeth down from the heaven mountains wherein is hail and smiteth therewith whom he will and averteth it from whom he will the flashing of his lightning all but snatcheth away the sight allah causeth the revolution of the day and the night lo herein is indeed lesson for those who see allah hath created every animal of water of them is kind that goeth upon its belly and kind that goeth upon two legs and kind that goeth upon four allah createth what he will lo allah is able to do all things verily we have sent down revelations and explained them allah guideth whom he will unto straight path and they say we believe in allah and the messenger and we obey then after that faction of them turn away such are not believers and when they appeal unto allah and his messenger to judge between them lo faction of them are averse but if right had been with them they would have come unto him willingly is there in their hearts disease or have they doubts or fear they lest allah and his messenger should wrong them in judgment nay but such are evildoers the saying of all true believers when they appeal unto allah and his messenger to judge between them is only that they say we hear and we obey and such are the successful he who obeyeth allah and his messenger and feareth allah and keepeth duty unto him such indeed are the victorious they swear by allah solemnly that if thou order them they will go forth say swear not known obedience is better lo allah is informed of what ye do say obey allah and obey the messenger but if ye turn away then it is for him to do only that wherewith he hath been charged and for you to do only that wherewith ye have been charged if ye obey him ye will go aright but the messenger hath no other charge than to convey the message plainly allah hath promised such of you as believe and do good work that he will surely make them to succeed the present rulers in the earth even as he caused those who were before them to succeed others and that he will surely establish for them their religion which he hath approved for them and will give them in exchange safety after their fear they serve me they ascribe no thing as partner unto me those who disbelieve henceforth they are the miscreants establish worship and pay the poor due and obey the messenger that haply ye may find mercy think not that the disbelievers can escape in the land fire will be their home hapless journey end ye who believe let your slaves and those of you who have not come to puberty ask leave of you at three times before they come into your presence before the prayer of dawn and when ye lay aside your raiment for the heat of noon and after the prayer of night three times of privacy for you it is no sin for them or for you at other times when some of you go round attendant upon others if they come into your presence without leave thus allah maketh clear the revelations for you allah is knower wise and when the children among you come to puberty then let them ask leave even as those before them used to ask it thus allah maketh clear his revelations for you allah is knower wise as for women past child bearing who have no hope of marriage it is no sin for them if they discard their outer clothing in such way as not to show adornment but to refrain is better for them allah is hearer knower no blame is there upon the blind nor any blame upon the lame nor any blame upon the sick nor on yourselves if ye eat from your houses or the houses of your fathers or the houses of your mothers or the houses of your brothers or the houses of your sisters or the houses of your fathers brothers or the houses of your fathers sisters or the houses of your mothers brothers or the houses of your mothers sisters or from that whereof ye hold the keys or from the house of friend no sin shall it be for you whether ye eat together or apart but when ye enter houses salute one another with greeting from allah blessed and sweet thus allah maketh clear his revelations for you that haply ye may understand they only are the true believers who believe in allah and his messenger and when they are with him on some common errand go not away until they have asked leave of him lo those who ask leave of thee those are they who believe in allah and his messenger so if they ask thy leave for some affair of theirs give leave to whom thou wilt of them and ask for them forgiveness of allah lo allah is forgiving merciful make not the calling of the messenger among you as your calling one of another allah knoweth those of you who steal away hiding themselves and let those who conspire to evade orders beware lest grief or painful punishment befall them lo verily unto allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth he knoweth your condition and he knoweth the day when they are returned unto him so that he may inform them of what they did allah is knower of all things sura al furqan the criterion the standard blessed is he who hath revealed unto his slave the criterion of right and wrong that he may be warner to the peoples he unto whom belongeth the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth he hath chosen no son nor hath he any partner in the sovereignty he hath created everything and hath meted out for it measure yet they choose beside him other gods who create naught but are themselves created and possess not hurt nor profit for themselves and possess not death nor life nor power to raise the dead those who disbelieve say this is naught but lie that he hath invented and other folk have helped him with it so that they have produced slander and lie and they say fables of the men of old which he hath had written down so that they are dictated to him morn and evening say unto them muhammad he who knoweth the secret of the heavens and the earth hath revealed it lo he ever is forgiving merciful and they say what aileth this messenger of allah that he eateth food and walketh in the markets why is not an angel sent down unto him to be warner with him or why is not treasure thrown down unto him or why hath he not paradise from whence to eat and the evil doers say ye are but following man bewitched see how they coin similitudes for thee so that they are all astray and cannot find road blessed is he who if he will will assign thee better than all that gardens underneath which rivers flow and will assign thee mansions nay but they deny the coming of the hour and for those who deny the coming of the hour we have prepared flame when it seeth them from afar they hear the crackling and the roar thereof and when they are flung into narrow place thereof chained together they pray for destruction there pray not that day for one destruction but pray for many destructions say is that doom better or the garden of immortality which is promised unto those who ward off evil it will be their reward and journey end therein abiding they have all that they desire it is for thy lord promise that must be fulfilled and on the day when he will assemble them and that which they worship instead of allah and will say was it ye who misled these my slaves or did they themselves wander from the way they will say be thou glorified it was not for us to choose any protecting friends beside thee but thou didst give them and their fathers ease till they forgot the warning and became lost folk thus they will give you the lie regarding what ye say then ye can neither avert the doom nor obtain help and whoso among you doeth wrong we shall make him taste great torment we never sent before thee any messengers but lo they verily ate food and walked in the markets and we have appointed some of you test for others will ye be steadfast and thy lord is ever seer and those who look not for meeting with us say why are angels not sent down unto us and why do we not see our lord assuredly they think too highly of themselves and are scornful with great pride on the day when they behold the angels on that day there will be no good tidings for the guilty and they will cry forbidding ban and we shall turn unto the work they did and make it scattered motes those who have earned the garden on that day will be better in their home and happier in their place of noonday rest day when the heaven with the clouds will be rent asunder and the angels will be sent down grand descent the sovereignty on that day will be the true sovereignty belonging to the beneficent one and it will be hard day for disbelievers on the day when the wrong doer gnaweth his hands he will say ah would that had chosen way together with the messenger of allah alas for me ah would that had never taken such an one for friend he verily led me astray from the reminder after it had reached me satan was ever man deserter in the hour of need and the messenger saith my lord lo mine own folk make this qur an of no account even so have we appointed unto every prophet an opponent from among the guilty but allah sufficeth for guide and helper and those who disbelieve say why is the qur an not revealed unto him all at once it is revealed thus that we may strengthen thy heart therewith and we have arranged it in right order and they bring thee no similitude but we bring thee the truth as against it and better than their similitude as argument those who will be gathered on their faces unto hell such are worse in plight and further from the right road we verily gave moses the scripture and placed with him his brother aaron as henchman then we said go together unto the folk who have denied our revelations then we destroyed them complete destruction and noah folk when they denied the messengers we drowned them and made of them portent for mankind we have prepared painful doom for evil doers and the tribes of ad and thamud and the dwellers in ar rass and many generations in between each of them we warned by examples and each of them we brought to utter ruin and indeed they have passed by the township whereon was rained the fatal rain can it be that they have not seen it nay but they hope for no resurrection and when they see thee muhammad they treat thee only as jest saying is this he whom allah sendeth as messenger he would have led us far away from our gods if we had not been staunch to them they will know when they behold the doom who is more astray as to the road hast thou seen him who chooseth for his god his own lust wouldst thou then be guardian over him or deemest thou that most of them hear or understand they are but as the cattle nay but they are farther astray hast thou not seen how thy lord hath spread the shade and if he willed he could have made it still then we have made the sun its pilot then we withdraw it unto us gradual withdrawal and he it is who maketh night covering for you and sleep repose and maketh day resurrection and he it is who sendeth the winds glad tidings heralding his mercy and we send down purifying water from the sky that we may give life thereby to dead land and we give many beasts and men that we have created to drink thereof and verily we have repeated it among them that they may remember but most of mankind begrudge aught save ingratitude if we willed we could raise up warner in every village so obey not the disbelievers but strive against them herewith with great endeavour and he it is who hath given independence to the two seas though they meet one palatable sweet and the other saltish bitter and hath set bar and forbidding ban between them and he it is who hath created man from water and hath appointed for him kindred by blood and kindred by marriage for thy lord is ever powerful yet they worship instead of allah that which can neither benefit them nor hurt them the disbeliever was ever partisan against his lord and we have sent thee muhammad only as bearer of good tidings and warner say ask of you no reward for this save that whoso will may choose way unto his lord and trust thou in the living one who dieth not and hymn his praise he sufficeth as the knower of his bondmen sins who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days then he mounted the throne the beneficent ask anyone informed concerning him and when it is said unto them prostrate to the beneficent they say and what is the beneficent are we to prostrate to whatever thou muhammad biddest us and it increaseth aversion in them blessed be he who hath placed in the heaven mansions of the stars and hath placed therein great lamp and moon giving light and he it is who hath appointed night and day in succession for him who desireth to remember or desireth thankfulness the faithful slaves of the beneficent are they who walk upon the earth modestly and when the foolish ones address them answer peace and who spend the night before their lord prostrate and standing and who say our lord avert from us the doom of hell lo the doom thereof is anguish lo it is wretched as abode and station and those who when they spend are neither prodigal nor grudging and there is ever firm station between the two and those who cry not unto any other god along with allah nor take the life which allah hath forbidden save in course of justice nor commit adultery and whoso doeth this shall pay the penalty the doom will be doubled for him on the day of resurrection and he will abide therein disdained for ever save him who repenteth and believeth and doth righteous work as for such allah will change their evil deeds to good deeds allah is ever forgiving merciful and whosoever repenteth and doeth good he verily repenteth toward allah with true repentance and those who will not witness vanity but when they pass near senseless play pass by with dignity and those who when they are reminded of the revelations of their lord fall not deaf and blind thereat and who say our lord vouchsafe us comfort of our wives and of our offspring and make us patterns for all those who ward off evil they will be awarded the high place forasmuch as they were steadfast and they will meet therein with welcome and the ward of peace abiding there for ever happy is it as abode and station say muhammad unto the disbelievers my lord would not concern himself with you but for your prayer but now ye have denied the truth therefor there will be judgment sura ash shuara the poets ta sin mim these are revelations of the scripture that maketh plain it may be that thou tormentest thyself muhammad because they believe not if we will we can send down on them from the sky portent so that their necks would remain bowed before it never cometh there unto them fresh reminder from the beneficent one but they turn away from it now they have denied the truth but there will come unto them tidings of that whereat they used to scoff have they not seen the earth how much of every fruitful kind we make to grow therein lo herein is indeed portent yet most of them are not believers and lo thy lord he is indeed the mighty the merciful and when thy lord called moses saying go unto the wrongdoing folk the folk of pharaoh will they not ward off evil he said my lord lo fear that they will deny me and shall be embarrassed and my tongue will not speak plainly therefor send for aaron to help me and they have crime against me so fear that they will kill me he said nay verily so go ye twain with our tokens lo we shall be with you hearing and come together unto pharaoh and say lo we bear message of the lord of the worlds saying let the children of israel go with us pharaoh said unto moses did we not rear thee among us as child and thou didst dwell many years of thy life among us and thou didst that thy deed which thou didst and thou wast one of the ingrates he said did it then when was of those who are astray then fled from you when feared you and my lord vouchsafed me command and appointed me of the number of those sent by him and this is the past favour wherewith thou reproachest me that thou hast enslaved the children of israel pharaoh said and what is the lord of the worlds moses said lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them if ye had but sure belief pharaoh said unto those around him hear ye not he said your lord and the lord of your fathers pharaoh said lo your messenger who hath been sent unto you is indeed madman he said lord of the east and the west and all that is between them if ye did but understand pharaoh said if thou choosest god other than me assuredly shall place thee among the prisoners he said even though show thee something plain pharaoh said produce it then if thou art of the truthful then he flung down his staff and it became serpent manifest and he drew forth his hand and lo it was white to the beholders pharaoh said unto the chiefs about him lo this is verily knowing wizard who would drive you out of your land by his magic now what counsel ye they said put him off him and his brother and send into the cities summoners who shall bring unto thee every knowing wizard so the wizards were gathered together at set time on day appointed and it was said unto the people are ye also gathering they said aye so that we may follow the wizards if they are the winners and when the wizards came they said unto pharaoh will there surely be reward for us if we are the winners he said aye and ye will then surely be of those brought near to me moses said unto them throw what ye are going to throw then they threw down their cords and their staves and said by pharaoh might lo we verily are the winners then moses threw his staff and lo it swallowed that which they did falsely show and the wizards were flung prostrate crying we believe in the lord of the worlds the lord of moses and aaron pharaoh said ye put your faith in him before give you leave lo he doubtless is your chief who taught you magic but verily ye shall come to know verily will cut off your hands and your feet alternately and verily will crucify you every one they said it is no hurt for lo unto our lord we shall return lo we ardently hope that our lord will forgive us our sins because we are the first of the believers and we inspired moses saying take away my slaves by night for ye will be pursued then pharaoh sent into the cities summoners who said lo these indeed are but little troop and lo they are offenders against us and lo we are ready host thus did we take them away from gardens and watersprings and treasures and fair estate thus were those things taken from them and we caused the children of israel to inherit them and they overtook them at sunrise and when the two hosts saw each other those with moses said lo we are indeed caught he said nay verily for lo my lord is with me he will guide me then we inspired moses saying smite the sea with thy staff and it parted and each part was as mountain vast then brought we near the others to that place and we saved moses and those with him every one and we drowned the others lo herein is indeed portent yet most of them are not believers and lo thy lord he is indeed the mighty the merciful recite unto them the story of abraham when he said unto his father and his folk what worship ye they said we worship idols and are ever devoted unto them he said do they hear you when ye cry or do they benefit or harm you they said nay but we found our fathers acting on this wise he said see now that which ye worship ye and your forefathers lo they are all an enemy unto me save the lord of the worlds who created me and he doth guide me and who feedeth me and watereth me and when sicken then he healeth me and who causeth me to die then giveth me life again and who ardently hope will forgive me my sin on the day of judgment my lord vouchsafe me wisdom and unite me to the righteous and give unto me good report in later generations and place me among the inheritors of the garden of delight and forgive my father lo he is of those who err and abase me not on the day when they are raised the day when wealth and sons avail not any man save him who bringeth unto allah whole heart and the garden will be brought nigh for those who ward off evil and hell will appear plainly to the erring and it will be said unto them where is all that ye used to worship instead of allah can they help you or help themselves then will they be hurled therein they and the seducers and the hosts of iblis together and they will say when they are quarrelling therein by allah of truth we were in error manifest when we made you equal with the lord of the worlds it was but the guilty who misled us now we have no intercessors nor any loving friend oh that we had another turn on earth that we might be of the believers lo herein is indeed portent yet most of them are not believers and lo thy lord he is indeed the mighty the merciful noah folk denied the messengers of allah when their brother noah said unto them will ye not ward off evil lo am faithful messenger unto you so keep your duty to allah and obey me and ask of you no wage therefor my wage is the concern only of the lord of the worlds so keep your duty to allah and obey me they said shall we put faith in thee when the lowest of the people follow thee he said and what knowledge have of what they may have been doing in the past lo their reckoning is my lord concern if ye but knew and am not here to repulse believers am only plain warner they said if thou cease not noah thou wilt surely be among those stoned to death he said my lord lo my own folk deny me therefor judge thou between us conclusive judgment and save me and those believers who are with me and we saved him and those with him in the laden ship then afterward we drowned the others lo herein is indeed portent yet most of them are not believers and lo thy lord he is indeed the mighty the merciful the tribe of ad denied the messengers of allah when their brother hud said unto them will ye not ward off evil lo am faithful messenger unto you so keep your duty to allah and obey me and ask of you no wage therefor my wage is the concern only of the lord of the worlds build ye on every high place monument for vain delight and seek ye out strongholds that haply ye may last for ever and if ye seize by force seize ye as tyrants rather keep your duty to allah and obey me keep your duty toward him who hath aided you with the good things that ye know hath aided you with cattle and sons and gardens and watersprings lo fear for you the retribution of an awful day they said it is all one to us whether thou preachest or art not of those who preach this is but fable of the men of old and we shall not be doomed and they denied him therefor we destroyed them lo herein is indeed portent yet most of them are not believers and lo thy lord he is indeed the mighty the merciful the tribe of thamud denied the messengers of allah when their brother salih said unto them will ye not ward off evil lo am faithful messenger unto you so keep your duty to allah and obey me and ask of you no wage therefor my wage is the concern only of the lord of the worlds will ye be left secure in that which is here before us in gardens and watersprings and tilled fields and heavy sheathed palm trees though ye hew out dwellings in the mountain being skilful therefor keep your duty to allah and obey me and obey not the command of the prodigal who spread corruption in the earth and reform not they said thou art but one of the bewitched thou art but mortal like us so bring some token if thou art of the truthful he said behold this she camel she hath the right to drink at the well and ye have the right to drink each on an appointed day and touch her not with ill lest there come on you the retribution of an awful day but they hamstrung her and then were penitent so the retribution came on them lo herein is indeed portent yet most of them are not believers and lo thy lord he is indeed the mighty the merciful the folk of lot denied the messengers of allah when their brother lot said unto them will ye not ward off evil lo am faithful messenger unto you so keep your duty to allah and obey me and ask of you no wage therefor my wage is the concern only of the lord of the worlds what of all creatures do ye come unto the males and leave the wives your lord created for you nay but ye are froward folk they said if thou cease not lot thou wilt soon be of the outcast he said am in truth of those who hate your conduct my lord save me and my household from what they do so we saved him and his household every one save an old woman among those who stayed behind then afterward we destroyed the others and we rained on them rain and dreadful is the rain of those who have been warned lo herein is indeed portent yet most of them are not believers and lo thy lord he is indeed the mighty the merciful the dwellers in the wood of midian denied the messengers of allah when shu eyb said unto them will ye not ward off evil lo am faithful messenger unto you so keep your duty to allah and obey me and ask of you no wage for it my wage is the concern only of the lord of the worlds give full measure and be not of those who give less than the due and weigh with the true balance wrong not mankind in their goods and do not evil making mischief in the earth and keep your duty unto him who created you and the generations of the men of old they said thou art but one of the bewitched thou art but mortal like us and lo we deem thee of the liars then make fragments of the heaven fall upon us if thou art of the truthful he said my lord is best aware of what ye do but they denied him so there came on them the retribution of the day of gloom lo it was the retribution of an awful day lo herein is indeed portent yet most of them are not believers and lo thy lord he is indeed the mighty the merciful and lo it is revelation of the lord of the worlds which the true spirit hath brought down upon thy heart that thou mayst be one of the warners in plain arabic speech and lo it is in the scriptures of the men of old is it not token for them that the doctors of the children of israel know it and if we had revealed it unto one of any other nation than the arabs and he had read it unto them they would not have believed in it thus do we make it traverse the hearts of the guilty they will not believe in it till they behold the painful doom so that it will come upon them suddenly when they perceive not then they will say are we to be reprieved would they now hasten on our doom hast thou then seen if we content them for long years and then cometh that which they were promised how that wherewith they were contented naught availeth them and we destroyed no township but it had its warners for reminder for we never were oppressors the devils did not bring it down it is not meet for them nor is it in their power lo verily they are banished from the hearing therefor invoke not with allah another god lest thou be one of the doomed and warn thy tribe of near kindred and lower thy wing in kindness unto those believers who follow thee and if they thy kinsfolk disobey thee say lo am innocent of what they do and put thy trust in the mighty the merciful who seeth thee when thou standest up to pray and seeth thine abasement among those who fall prostrate in worship lo he only he is the hearer the knower shall inform you upon whom the devils descend they descend on every sinful false one they listen eagerly but most of them are liars as for poets the erring follow them hast thou not seen how they stray in every valley and how they say that which they do not save those who believe and do good works and remember allah much and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged those who do wrong will come to know by what great reverse they will be overturned sura an naml the ant the ants ta sin these are revelations of the qur an and scripture that maketh plain guidance and good tidings for believers who establish worship and pay the poor due and are sure of the hereafter lo as for those who believe not in the hereafter we have made their works fairseeming unto them so that they are all astray those are they for whom is the worst of punishment and in the hereafter they will be the greatest losers lo as for thee muhammad thou verily receivest the qur an from the presence of one wise aware remember when moses said unto his household lo spy afar off fire will bring you tidings thence or bring to you borrowed flame that ye may warm yourselves but when he reached it he was called saying blessed is whosoever is in the fire and whosoever is round about it and glorified be allah the lord of the worlds moses lo it is allah the mighty the wise and throw down thy staff but when he saw it writhing as it were demon he turned to flee headlong but it was said unto him moses fear not the emissaries fear not in my presence save him who hath done wrong and afterward hath changed evil for good and lo am forgiving merciful and put thy hand into the bosom of thy robe it will come forth white but unhurt this will be one among nine tokens unto pharaoh and his people lo they were ever evil living folk but when our tokens came unto them plain to see they said this is mere magic and they denied them though their souls acknowledged them for spite and arrogance then see the nature of the consequence for the wrong doers and we verily gave knowledge unto david and solomon and they said praise be to allah who hath preferred us above many of his believing slaves and solomon was david heir and he said mankind lo we have been taught the language of birds and have been given abundance of all things this surely is evident favour and there were gathered together unto solomon his armies of the jinn and humankind and of the birds and they were set in battle order till when they reached the valley of the ants an ant exclaimed ants enter your dwellings lest solomon and his armies crush you unperceiving and solomon smiled laughing at her speech and said my lord arouse me to be thankful for thy favour wherewith thou hast favoured me and my parents and to do good that shall be pleasing unto thee and include me in the number of thy righteous slaves and he sought among the birds and said how is it that see not the hoopoe or is he among the absent verily will punish him with hard punishment or verily will slay him or he verily shall bring me plain excuse but he was not long in coming and he said have found out thing that thou apprehendest not and come unto thee from sheba with sure tidings lo found woman ruling over them and she hath been given abundance of all things and hers is mighty throne found her and her people worshipping the sun instead of allah and satan maketh their works fairseeming unto them and debarreth them from the way of truth so that they go not aright so that they worship not allah who bringeth forth the hidden in the heavens and the earth and knoweth what ye hide and what ye proclaim allah there is no allah save him the lord of the tremendous throne solomon said we shall see whether thou speakest truth or whether thou art of the liars go with this my letter and throw it down unto them then turn away and see what answer they return the queen of sheba said when she received the letter chieftains lo there hath been thrown unto me noble letter lo it is from solomon and lo it is in the name of allah the beneficent the merciful exalt not yourselves against me but come unto me as those who surrender she said chieftains pronounce for me in my case decide no case till ye are present with me they said we are lords of might and lords of great prowess but it is for thee to command so consider what thou wilt command she said lo kings when they enter township ruin it and make the honour of its people shame thus will they do but lo am going to send present unto them and to see with what answer the messengers return so when the envoy came unto solomon the king said what would ye help me with wealth but that which allah hath given me is better than that which he hath given you nay it is ye and not who exult in your gift return unto them we verily shall come unto them with hosts that they cannot resist and we shall drive them out from thence with shame and they will be abased he said chiefs which of you will bring me her throne before they come unto me surrendering stalwart of the jinn said will bring it thee before thou canst rise from thy place lo verily am strong and trusty for such work one with whom was knowledge of the scripture said will bring it thee before thy gaze returneth unto thee and when he saw it set in his presence solomon said this is of the bounty of my lord that he may try me whether give thanks or am ungrateful whosoever giveth thanks he only giveth thanks for the good of his own soul and whosoever is ungrateful is ungrateful only to his own soul hurt for lo my lord is absolute in independence bountiful he said disguise her throne for her that we may see whether she will go aright or be of those not rightly guided so when she came it was said unto her is thy throne like this she said it is as though it were the very one and solomon said we were given the knowledge before her and we had surrendered to allah and all that she was wont to worship instead of allah hindered her for she came of disbelieving folk it was said unto her enter the hall and when she saw it she deemed it pool and bared her legs solomon said lo it is hall made smooth of glass she said my lord lo have wronged myself and surrender with solomon unto allah the lord of the worlds and we verily sent unto thamud their brother salih saying worship allah and lo they then became two parties quarrelling he said my people why will ye hasten on the evil rather than the good why will ye not ask pardon of allah that ye may receive mercy they said we augur evil of thee and those with thee he said your evil augury is with allah nay but ye are folk that are being tested and there were in the city nine persons who made mischief in the land and reformed not they said swear one to another by allah that we verily will attack him and his household by night and afterward we will surely say unto his friend we witnessed not the destruction of his household and lo we are truthtellers so they plotted plot and we plotted plot while they perceived not then see the nature of the consequence of their plotting for lo we destroyed them and their people every one see yonder are their dwellings empty and in ruins because they did wrong lo herein is indeed portent for people who have knowledge and we saved those who believed and used to ward off evil and lot when he said unto his folk will ye commit abomination knowingly must ye needs lust after men instead of women nay but ye are folk who act senselessly but the answer of his folk was naught save that they said expel the household of lot from your township for they forsooth are folk who would keep clean then we saved him and his household save his wife we destined her to be of those who stayed behind and we rained rain upon them dreadful is the rain of those who have been warned say muhammad praise be to allah and peace be on his slaves whom he hath chosen is allah best or all that ye ascribe as partners unto him is not he best who created the heavens and the earth and sendeth down for you water from the sky wherewith we cause to spring forth joyous orchards whose trees it never hath been yours to cause to grow is there any allah beside allah nay but they are folk who ascribe equals unto him is not he best who made the earth fixed abode and placed rivers in the folds thereof and placed firm hills therein and hath set barrier between the two seas is there any allah beside allah nay but most of them know not is not he best who answereth the wronged one when he crieth unto him and removeth the evil and hath made you viceroys of the earth is there any allah beside allah little do they reflect is not he best who guideth you in the darkness of the land and the sea he who sendeth the winds as heralds of his mercy is there any allah beside allah high exalted be allah from all that they ascribe as partner unto him is not he best who produceth creation then reproduceth it and who provideth for you from the heaven and the earth is there any allah beside allah say bring your proof if ye are truthful say muhammad none in the heavens and the earth knoweth the unseen save allah and they know not when they will be raised again nay but doth their knowledge reach to the hereafter nay for they are in doubt concerning it nay for they cannot see it yet those who disbelieve say when we have become dust like our fathers shall we verily be brought forth again we were promised this forsooth we and our fathers all this is naught but fables of the men of old say unto them muhammad travel in the land and see the nature of the sequel for the guilty and grieve thou not for them nor be in distress because of what they plot against thee and they say when will this promise be fulfilled if ye are truthful say it may be that part of that which ye would hasten on is close behind you lo thy lord is full of bounty for mankind but most of them do not give thanks lo thy lord knoweth surely all that their bosoms hide and all that they proclaim and there is nothing hidden in the heaven or the earth but it is in clear record lo this qur an narrateth unto the children of israel most of that concerning which they differ and lo it is guidance and mercy for believers lo thy lord will judge between them of his wisdom and he is the mighty the wise therefor muhammad put thy trust in allah for thou standest on the plain truth lo thou canst not make the dead to hear nor canst thou make the deaf to hear the call when they have turned to flee nor canst thou lead the blind out of their error thou canst make none to hear save those who believe our revelations and who have surrendered and when the word is fulfilled concerning them we shall bring forth beast of the earth to speak unto them because mankind had not faith in our revelations and remind them of the day when we shall gather out of every nation host of those who denied our revelations and they will be set in array till when they come before their lord he will say did ye deny my revelations when ye could not compass them in knowledge or what was it that ye did and the word will be fulfilled concerning them because they have done wrong and they will not speak have they not seen how we have appointed the night that they may rest therein and the day sight giving lo therein verily are portents for people who believe and remind them of the day when the trumpet will be blown and all who are in the heavens and the earth will start in fear save him whom allah willeth and all come unto him humbled and thou seest the hills thou deemest solid flying with the flight of clouds the doing of allah who perfecteth all things lo he is informed of what ye do whoso bringeth good deed will have better than its worth and such are safe from fear that day and whoso bringeth an ill deed such will be flung down on their faces in the fire are ye rewarded aught save what ye did say muhammad am commanded only to serve the lord of this land which he hath hallowed and unto whom all things belong and am commanded to be of those who surrender unto him and to recite the qur an and whoso goeth right goeth right only for the good of his own soul and as for him who goeth astray unto him say lo am only warner and say praise be to allah who will show you his portents so that ye shall know them and thy lord is not unaware of what ye mortals do sura al qasas the story stories ta sin mim these are revelations of the scripture that maketh plain we narrate unto thee somewhat of the story of moses and pharaoh with truth for folk who believe lo pharaoh exalted himself in the earth and made its people castes tribe among them he oppressed killing their sons and sparing their women lo he was of those who work corruption and we desired to show favour unto those who were oppressed in the earth and to make them examples and to make them the inheritors and to establish them in the earth and to show pharaoh and haman and their hosts that which they feared from them and we inspired the mother of moses saying suckle him and when thou fearest for him then cast him into the river and fear not nor grieve lo we shall bring him back unto thee and shall make him one of our messengers and the family of pharaoh took him up that he might become for them an enemy and sorrow lo pharaoh and haman and their hosts were ever sinning and the wife of pharaoh said he will be consolation for me and for thee kill him not peradventure he may be of use to us or we may choose him for son and they perceived not and the heart of the mother of moses became void and she would have betrayed him if we had not fortified her heart that she might be of the believers and she said unto his sister trace him so she observed him from afar and they perceived not and we had before forbidden foster mothers for him so she said shall show you household who will rear him for you and take care of him so we restored him to his mother that she might be comforted and not grieve and that she might know that the promise of allah is true but most of them know not and when he reached his full strength and was ripe we gave him wisdom and knowledge thus do we reward the good and he entered the city at time of carelessness of its folk and he found therein two men fighting one of his own caste and the other of his enemies and he who was of his caste asked him for help against him who was of his enemies so moses struck him with his fist and killed him he said this is of the devil doing lo he is an enemy mere misleader he said my lord lo have wronged my soul so forgive me then he forgave him lo he is the forgiving the merciful he said my lord forasmuch as thou hast favoured me will nevermore be supporter of the guilty and morning found him in the city fearing vigilant when behold he who had appealed to him the day before cried out to him for help moses said unto him lo thou art indeed mere hothead and when he would have fallen upon the man who was an enemy unto them both he said moses wouldst thou kill me as thou didst kill person yesterday thou wouldst be nothing but tyrant in the land thou wouldst not be of the reformers and man came from the uttermost part of the city running he said moses lo the chiefs take counsel against thee to slay thee therefor escape lo am of those who give thee good advice so he escaped from thence fearing vigilant he said my lord deliver me from the wrongdoing folk and when he turned his face toward midian he said peradventure my lord will guide me in the right road and when he came unto the water of midian he found there whole tribe of men watering and he found apart from them two women keeping back their flocks he said what aileth you the two said we cannot give our flocks to drink till the shepherds return from the water and our father is very old man so he watered their flock for them then he turned aside into the shade and said my lord am needy of whatever good thou sendest down for me then there came unto him one of the two women walking shyly she said lo my father biddeth thee that he may reward thee with payment for that thou didst water the flock for us then when he came unto him and told him the whole story he said fear not thou hast escaped from the wrongdoing folk one of the two women said my father hire him for the best man that thou canst hire in the strong the trustworthy he said lo fain would marry thee to one on condition that thou hirest thyself to me for then if thou completest ten it will be of thine it hard for thee allah willing thou wilt find of these two daughters of mine the term of eight pilgrimages own accord for would not make me of the righteous he said that is settled between thee and me whichever of the two terms fulfil there will be no injustice to me and allah is surety over what we say then when moses had fulfilled the term and was travelling with his housefolk he saw in the distance fire and said unto his housefolk bide ye here lo see in the distance fire peradventure shall bring you tidings thence or brand from the fire that ye may warm yourselves and when he reached it he was called from the right side of the valley in the blessed field from the tree moses lo even am allah the lord of the worlds throw down thy staff and when he saw it writhing as it had been demon he turned to flee headlong and it was said unto him moses draw nigh and fear not lo thou art of those who are secure thrust thy hand into the bosom of thy robe it will come forth white without hurt and guard thy heart from fear then these shall be two proofs from your lord unto pharaoh and his chiefs lo they are evil living folk he said my lord lo killed man among them and fear that they will kill me my brother aaron is more eloquent than me in speech therefor send him with me as helper to confirm me lo fear that they will give the lie to me he said we will strengthen thine arm with thy brother and we will give unto you both power so that they cannot reach you for our portents ye twain and those who follow you will be the winners but when moses came unto them with our clear tokens they said this is naught but invented magic we never heard of this among our fathers of old and moses said my lord is best aware of him who bringeth guidance from his presence and whose will be the sequel of the home of bliss lo wrong doers will not be successful and pharaoh said chiefs know not that ye have god other than me so kindle for me fire haman to bake the mud and set up for me lofty tower in order that may survey the god of moses and lo deem him of the liars and he and his hosts were haughty in the land without right and deemed that they would never be brought back to us therefor we seized him and his hosts and abandoned them unto the sea behold the nature of the consequence for evil doers and we made them patterns that invite unto the fire and on the day of resurrection they will not be helped and we made curse to follow them in this world and on the day of resurrection they will be among the hateful and we verily gave the scripture unto moses after we had destroyed the generations of old clear testimonies for mankind and guidance and mercy that haply they might reflect and thou muhammad wast not on the western side of the mount when we expounded unto moses the commandment and thou wast not among those present but we brought forth generations and their lives dragged on for them and thou wast not dweller in midian reciting unto them our revelations but we kept sending messengers to men and thou was not beside the mount when we did call but the knowledge of it is mercy from thy lord that thou mayst warn folk unto whom no warner came before thee that haply they may give heed otherwise if disaster should afflict them because of that which their own hands have sent before them they might say our lord why sentest thou no messenger unto us that we might have followed thy revelations and been of the believers but when there came unto them the truth from our presence they said why is he not given the like of what was given unto moses did they not disbelieve in that which was given unto moses of old they say two magics that support each other and they say lo in both we are disbelievers say unto them muhammad then bring scripture from the presence of allah that giveth clearer guidance than these two that may follow it if ye are truthful and if they answer thee not then know that what they follow is their lusts and who goeth farther astray than he who followeth his lust without guidance from allah lo allah guideth not wrongdoing folk and now verily we have caused the word to reach them that haply they may give heed those unto whom we gave the scripture before it they believe in it and when it is recited unto them they say we believe in it lo it is the truth from our lord lo even before it we were of those who surrender unto him these will be given their reward twice over because they are steadfast and repel evil with good and spend of that wherewith we have provided them and when they hear vanity they withdraw from it and say unto us our works and unto you your works peace be unto you we desire not the ignorant lo thou muhammad guidest not whom thou lovest but allah guideth whom he will and he is best aware of those who walk aright out the but and they say if we were to follow the guidance with thee we should be torn of our land have we not established for them sure sanctuary whereunto produce of all things is brought in trade provision from our presence most of them know not and how many community have we destroyed that was thankless for its means of livelihood and yonder are their dwellings which have not been inhabited after them save little and we even we were the inheritors and never did thy lord destroy the townships till he had raised up in their mother town messenger reciting unto them our revelations and never did we destroy the townships unless the folk thereof were evil doers and whatsoever ye have been given is comfort of the life of the world and an ornament thereof and that which allah hath is better and more lasting have ye then no sense is he whom we have promised fair promise which he will find true like him whom we suffer to enjoy awhile the comfort of the life of the world then on the day of resurrection he will be of those arraigned on the day when he will call unto them and say where are my partners whom ye imagined those concerning whom the word will have come true will say our lord these are they whom we led astray we led them astray even as we ourselves were astray we declare our innocence before thee us they never worshipped and it will be said cry unto your so called partners of allah and they will cry unto them and they will give no answer unto them and they will see the doom ah if they had but been guided and on the day when he will call unto them and say what answer gave ye to the messengers on that day all tidings will be dimmed for them nor will they ask one of another but as for him who shall repent and believe and do right he haply may be one of the successful thy lord bringeth to pass what he willeth and chooseth they have never any choice glorified be allah and exalted above all that they associate with him and thy lord knoweth what their breasts conceal and what they publish and he is allah there is no allah save him his is all praise in the former and the latter state and his is the command and unto him ye will be brought back say have ye thought if allah made night everlasting for you till the day of resurrection who is god beside allah who could bring you light will ye not then hear say have ye thought if allah made day everlasting for you till the day of resurrection who is god beside allah who could bring you night wherein ye rest will ye not then see of his mercy hath he appointed for you night and day that therein ye may rest and that ye may seek his bounty and that haply ye may be thankful and on the day when he shall call unto them and say where are my partners whom ye pretended and we shall take out from every nation witness and we shall say bring your proof then they will know that allah hath the truth and all that they invented will have failed them now korah was of moses folk but he oppressed them and we gave him so much treasure that the stores thereof would verily have been burden for troop of mighty men when his own folk said unto him exult not lo allah loveth not the exultant but seek the abode of the hereafter in that which allah hath given thee and neglect not thy portion of the world and be thou kind even as allah hath been kind to thee and seek not corruption in the earth lo allah loveth not corrupters he said have been given it only on account of knowledge possess knew he not that allah had destroyed already of the generations before him men who were mightier than him in strength and greater in respect of following the guilty are not questioned of their sins then went he forth before his people in his pomp those who were desirous of the life of the world said ah would that we had the like of what hath been given unto korah lo he is lord of rare good fortune but those who had been given knowledge said woe unto you the reward of allah for him who believeth and doeth right is better and only the steadfast will obtain it so we caused the earth to swallow him and his dwelling place then he had no host to help him against allah nor was he of those who can save themselves and morning found those who had coveted his place but yesterday crying ah welladay allah enlargeth the provision for whom he will of his slaves and straiteneth it for whom he will if allah had not been gracious unto us he would have caused it to swallow us also ah welladay the disbelievers never prosper as for that abode of the hereafter we assign it unto those who seek not oppression in the earth nor yet corruption the sequel is for those who ward off evil whoso bringeth good deed he will have better than the same while as for him who bringeth an ill deed those who do ill deeds will be requited only what they did lo he who hath given thee the qur an for law will surely bring thee home again say my lord is best aware of him who bringeth guidance and him who is in error manifest thou hadst no hope that the scripture would be inspired in thee but it is mercy from thy lord so never be helper to the disbelievers and let them not divert thee from the revelations of allah after they have been sent down unto thee but call mankind unto thy lord and be not of those who ascribe partners unto him and cry not unto any other god along with allah there is no allah save him everything will perish save his countenance his is the command and unto him ye will be brought back sura al ankaboot the spider alif lam mim do men imagine that they will be left at ease because they say we believe and will not be tested with affliction lo we tested those who were before you thus allah knoweth those who are sincere and knoweth those who feign or do those who do ill deeds imagine that they can outstrip us evil for them is that which they decide whoso looketh forward to the meeting with allah let him know that allah reckoning is surely nigh and he is the hearer the knower and whosoever striveth striveth only for himself for lo allah is altogether independent of his creatures and as for those who believe and do good works we shall remit from them their evil deeds and shall repay them the best that they did we have enjoined on man kindness to parents but if they strive to make thee join with me that of which thou hast no knowledge then obey them not unto me is your return and shall tell you what ye used to do and as for those who believe and do good works we verily shall make them enter in among the righteous of mankind is he who saith we believe in allah but if he be made to suffer for the sake of allah he mistaketh the persecution of mankind for allah punishment and then if victory cometh from thy lord will say lo we were with you all the while is not allah best aware of what is in the bosoms of his creatures verily allah knoweth those who believe and verily he knoweth the hypocrites those who disbelieve say unto those who believe follow our way of religion and we verily will bear your sins for you they cannot bear aught of their sins lo they verily are liars but they verily will bear their own loads and other loads beside their own and they verily will be questioned on the day of resurrection concerning that which they invented and verily we sent noah as our messenger unto his folk and he continued with them for thousand years save fifty years and the flood engulfed them for they were wrong doers and we rescued him and those with him in the ship and made of it portent for the peoples and abraham remember when he said unto his folk serve allah and keep your duty unto him that is better for you if ye did but know ye serve instead of allah only idols and ye only invent lie lo those whom ye serve instead of allah own no provision for you so seek your provision from allah and serve him and give thanks unto him for unto him ye will be brought back but if ye deny then nations have denied before you the messenger is only to convey the message plainly see they not how allah produceth creation then reproduceth it lo for allah that is easy say muhammad travel in the land and see how he originated creation then allah bringeth forth the later growth lo allah is able to do all things he punisheth whom he will and showeth mercy unto whom he will and unto him ye will be turned ye cannot escape from him in the earth or in the sky and beside allah there is for you no friend or helper those who disbelieve in the revelations of allah and in their meeting with him such have no hope of my mercy for such there is painful doom but the answer of his folk was only that they said kill him or burn him then allah saved him from the fire lo herein verily are portents for folk who believe he said ye have chosen only idols instead of allah the love between you is only in the life of the world then on the day of resurrection ye will deny each other and curse each other and your abode will be the fire and ye will have no helpers and lot believed him and said lo am fugitive unto my lord lo he only he is the mighty the wise and we bestowed on him isaac and jacob and we established the prophethood and the scripture among his seed and we gave him his reward in the world and lo in the hereafter he verily is among the righteous and lot remember when he said unto his folk lo ye commit lewdness such as no creature did before you for come ye not in unto males and cut ye not the road for travellers and commit ye not abomination in your meetings but the answer of his folk was only that they said bring allah doom upon us if thou art truthteller he said my lord give me victory over folk who work corruption and when our messengers brought abraham the good news they said lo we are about to destroy the people of that township for its people are wrong doers he said lo lot is there they said we are best aware of who is there we are to deliver him and his household all save his wife who is of those who stay behind and when our messengers came unto lot he was troubled upon their account for he could not protect them but they said fear not nor grieve lo we are to deliver thee and thy household all save thy wife who is of those who stay behind lo we are about to bring down upon the folk of this township fury from the sky because they are evil livers and verily of that we have left clear sign for people who have sense and unto midian we sent shu eyb their brother he said my people serve allah and look forward to the last day and do not evil making mischief in the earth but they denied him and the dreadful earthquake took them and morning found them prostrate in their dwelling place and the tribes of ad and thamud their fate is manifest unto you from their ruined and deserted dwellings satan made their deeds seem fair unto them and so debarred them from the way though they were keen observers and korah pharaoh and haman moses came unto them with clear proofs of allah sovereignty but they were boastful in the land and they were not winners in the race so we took each one in his sin of them was he on whom we sent hurricane and of them was he who was overtaken by the awful cry and of them was he whom we caused the earth to swallow and of them was he whom we drowned it was not for allah to wrong them but they wronged themselves the likeness of those who choose other patrons than allah is as the likeness of the spider when she taketh unto herself house and lo the frailest of all houses is the spider house if they but knew lo allah knoweth what thing they invoke instead of him he is the mighty the wise as for these similitudes we coin them for mankind but none will grasp their meaning save the wise allah created the heavens and the earth with truth lo therein is indeed portent for believers recite that which hath been inspired in thee of the scripture and establish worship lo worship preserveth from lewdness and iniquity but verily remembrance of allah is more important and allah knoweth what ye do and argue not with the people of the scripture unless it be in way that is better save with such of them as do wrong and say we believe in that which hath been revealed unto us and revealed unto you our allah and your allah is one and unto him we surrender in like manner we have revealed unto thee the scripture and those unto whom we gave the scripture aforetime will believe therein and of these also there are some who believe therein and none deny our revelations save the disbelievers and thou muhammad wast not reader of any scripture before it nor didst thou write it with thy right hand for then might those have doubted who follow falsehood but it is clear revelations in the hearts of those who have been given knowledge and none deny our revelations save wrong doers and they say why are not portents sent down upon him from his lord say portents are with allah only and am but plain warner is it not enough for them that we have sent down unto thee the scripture which is read unto them lo herein verily is mercy and reminder for folk who believe say unto them muhammad allah sufficeth for witness between me and you he knoweth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and those who believe in vanity and disbelieve in allah they it is who are the losers they bid thee hasten on the doom of allah and if term had not been appointed the doom would assuredly have come unto them ere now and verily it will come upon them suddenly when they perceive not they bid thee hasten on the doom when lo hell verily will encompass the disbelievers on the day when the doom will overwhelm them from above them and from underneath their feet and he will say taste what ye used to do my bondmen who believe lo my earth is spacious therefor serve me only every soul will taste of death then unto us ye will be returned those who believe and do good works them verily we shall house in lofty dwellings of the garden underneath which rivers flow there they will dwell secure how sweet the guerdon of the toilers who persevere and put their trust in their lord and how many an animal there is that beareth not its own provision allah provideth for it and for you he is the hearer the knower and if thou wert to ask them who created the heavens and the earth and constrained the sun and the moon to their appointed work they would say allah how then are they turned away allah maketh the provision wide for whom he will of his bondmen and straiteneth it for whom he will lo allah is aware of all things and if thou wert to ask them who causeth water to come down from the sky and therewith reviveth the earth after its death they verily would say allah say praise be to allah but most of them have no sense this life of the world is but pastime and game lo the home of the hereafter that is life if they but knew and when they mount upon the ships they pray to allah making their faith pure for him only but when he bringeth them safe to land behold they ascribe partners unto him that they may disbelieve in that which we have given them and that they may take their ease but they will come to know have they not seen that we have appointed sanctuary immune from violence while mankind are ravaged all around them do they then believe in falsehood and disbelieve in the bounty of allah who doeth greater wrong than he who inventeth lie concerning allah or denieth the truth when it cometh unto him is not there home in hell for disbelievers as for those who strive in us we surely guide them to our paths and lo allah is with the good sura ar room the romans the byzantines alif lam mim the romans have been defeated in the nearer land and they after their defeat will be victorious within ten years allah is the command in the former case and in the latter and in that day believers will rejoice in allah help to victory he helpeth to victory whom he will he is the mighty the merciful it is promise of allah allah faileth not his promise but most of mankind know not they know only some appearance of the life of the world and are heedless of the hereafter have they not pondered upon themselves allah created not the heavens and the earth and that which is between them save with truth and for destined end but truly many of mankind are disbelievers in the meeting with their lord have they not travelled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence for those who were before them they were stronger than these in power and they dug the earth and built upon it more than these have built messengers of their own came unto them with clear proofs of allah sovereignty surely allah wronged them not but they did wrong themselves then evil was the consequence to those who dealt in evil because they denied the revelations of allah and made mock of them allah produceth creation then he reproduceth it then unto him ye will be returned and in the day when the hour riseth the unrighteous will despair there will be none to intercede for them of those whom they made equal with allah and they will reject their partners whom they ascribed unto him in the day when the hour cometh in that day they will be sundered as for those who believed and did good works they will be made happy in garden but as for those who disbelieved and denied our revelations and denied the meeting of the hereafter such will be brought to doom so glory be to allah when ye enter the night and when ye enter the morning unto him be praise in the heavens and the earth and at the sun decline and in the noonday he bringeth forth the living from the dead and he bringeth forth the dead from the living and he reviveth the earth after her death and even so will ye be brought forth and of his signs is this he created you of dust and behold you human beings ranging widely and of his signs is this he created for you helpmeets from yourselves that ye might find rest in them and he ordained between you love and mercy lo herein indeed are portents for folk who reflect and of his signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the difference of your languages and colours lo herein indeed are portents for men of knowledge and of his signs is your slumber by night and by day and your seeking of his bounty lo herein indeed are portents for folk who heed and of his signs is this he showeth you the lightning for fear and for hope and sendeth down water from the sky and thereby quickeneth the earth after her death lo herein indeed are portents for folk who understand and of his signs is this the heavens and the earth stand fast by his command and afterward when he calleth you lo from the earth ye will emerge unto him belongeth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth all are obedient unto him he it is who produceth creation then reproduceth it and it is easier for him his is the sublime similitude in the heavens and the earth he is the mighty the wise he coineth for you similitude of yourselves have ye from among those whom your right hands possess partners in the wealth we have bestowed upon you equal with you in respect thereof so that ye fear them as ye fear each other that ye ascribe unto us partners out of that which we created thus we display the revelations for people who have sense nay but those who do wrong follow their own lusts without knowledge who is able to guide him whom allah hath sent astray for such there are no helpers so set thy purpose muhammad for religion as man by nature upright the nature framed of allah in which he hath created man there is no altering the laws of allah creation that is the right religion but most men know not turning unto him only and be careful of your duty unto him and establish worship and be not of those who ascribe partners unto him of those who split up their religion and became schismatics each sect exulting in its tenets and when harm toucheth men they cry unto their lord turning to him in repentance then when they have tasted of his mercy behold some of them attribute partners to their lord so as to disbelieve in that which we have given them unto such it is said enjoy yourselves awhile but ye will come to know or have we revealed unto them any warrant which speaketh of that which they associate with him and when we cause mankind to taste of mercy they rejoice therein but if an evil thing befall them as the consequence of their own deeds lo they are in despair see they not that allah enlargeth the provision for whom he will and straiteneth it for whom he will lo herein indeed are portents for folk who believe so give to the kinsman his due and to the needy and to the wayfarer that is best for those who seek allah countenance and such are they who are successful that which ye give in usury in order that it may increase on other people property hath no increase with allah but that which ye give in charity seeking allah countenance hath increase manifold allah is he who created you and then sustained you then causeth you to die then giveth life to you again is there any of your so called partners of allah that doeth aught of that praised and exalted be he above what they associate with him corruption doth appear on land and sea because of the evil which men hands have done that he may make them taste part of that which they have done in order that they may return say muhammad to the disbelievers travel in the land and see the nature of the consequence for those who were before you most of them were idolaters so set thy purpose resolutely for the right religion before the inevitable day cometh from allah on that day mankind will be sundered whoso disbelieveth must then bear the consequences of his disbelief while those who do right make provision for themselves that he may reward out of his bounty those who believe and do good works lo he loveth not the disbelievers in his guidance and of his signs is this he sendeth herald winds to make you taste his mercy and that the ships may sail at his command and that ye may seek his favour and that haply ye may be thankful verily we sent before thee muhammad messengers to their own folk then we took vengeance upon those who were guilty in regard to them to help believers is ever incumbent upon us allah is he who sendeth the winds so that they raise clouds and spreadeth them along the sky as pleaseth him and causeth them to break and thou seest the rain downpouring from within them and when he maketh it to fall on whom he will of his bondmen lo they rejoice though before that even before it was sent down upon them they were in despair look therefore at the prints of allah mercy in creation how he quickeneth the earth after her death lo he verily is the quickener of the dead and he is able to do all things and if we sent wind and they beheld it yellow they verily would still continue in their disbelief for verily thou muhammad canst not make the dead to hear nor canst thou make the deaf to hear the call when they have turned to flee nor canst thou guide the blind out of their error thou canst make none to hear save those who believe in our revelations so that they surrender unto him allah is he who shaped you out of weakness then appointed after weakness strength then after strength appointed weakness and grey hair he createth what he will he is the knower the mighty and on the day when the hour riseth the guilty will vow that they did tarry but an hour thus were they ever deceived but those to whom knowledge and faith are given will say the truth is ye have tarried by allah decree until the day of resurrection this is the day of resurrection but ye used not to know in that day their excuses will not profit those who did injustice nor will they be allowed to make amends verily we have coined for mankind in this qur an all kinds of similitudes and indeed if thou camest unto them with miracle those who disbelieve would verily exclaim ye are but tricksters thus doth allah seal the hearts of those who know not so have patience muhammad allah promise is the very truth and let not those who have no certainty make thee impatient sura luqman luqman alif lam mim these are revelations of the wise scripture guidance and mercy for the good those who establish worship and pay the poor due and have sure faith in the hereafter such have guidance from their lord such are the successful and of mankind is he who payeth for mere pastime of discourse that he may mislead from allah way without knowledge and maketh it the butt of mockery for such there is shameful doom and when our revelations are recited unto him he turneth away in pride as if he heard them not as if there were deafness in his ears so give him tidings of painful doom lo those who believe and do good works for them are the gardens of delight wherein they will abide it is promise of allah in truth he is the mighty the wise he hath created the heavens without supports that ye can see and hath cast into the earth firm hills so that it quake not with you and he hath dispersed therein all kinds of beasts and we send down water from the sky and we cause plants of every goodly kind to grow therein this is the creation of allah now show me that which those ye worship beside him have created nay but the wrong doers are in error manifest and verily we gave luqman wisdom saying give thanks unto allah and whosoever giveth thanks he giveth thanks for the good of his soul and whosoever refuseth lo allah is absolute owner of praise and remember when luqman said unto his son when he was exhorting him my dear son ascribe no partners unto allah lo to ascribe partners unto him is tremendous wrong and we have enjoined upon man concerning his partners his mother beareth him in weakness upon weakness and his weaning is in two years give thanks unto me and unto thy parents unto me is the journeying but if they strive with thee to make thee ascribe unto me as partner that of which thou hast no knowledge then obey them not consort with them in the world kindly and follow the path of him who repenteth unto me then unto me will be your return and shall tell you what ye used to do my dear son lo though it be but the weight of grain of mustard seed and though it be in rock or in the heavens or in the earth allah will bring it forth lo allah is subtile aware my dear son establish worship and enjoin kindness and forbid iniquity and persevere whatever may befall thee lo that is of the steadfast heart of things turn not thy cheek in scorn toward folk nor walk with pertness in the land lo allah loveth not each braggart boaster be modest in thy bearing and subdue thy voice lo the harshest of all voices is the voice of the ass see ye not how allah hath made serviceable unto you whatsoever is in the skies and whatsoever is in the earth and hath loaded you with his favours both without and within yet of mankind is he who disputeth concerning allah without knowledge or guidance or scripture giving light and if it be said unto them follow that which allah hath revealed they say nay but we follow that wherein we found our fathers what even though the devil were inviting them unto the doom of flame whosoever surrendereth his purpose to allah while doing good he verily hath grasped the firm hand hold unto allah belongeth the sequel of all things and whosoever disbelieveth let not his disbelief afflict thee muhammad unto us is their return and we shall tell them what they did lo allah is aware of what is in the breasts of men we give them comfort for little and then we drive them to heavy doom if thou shouldst ask them who created the heavens and the earth they would answer allah say praise be to allah but most of them know not unto allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth lo allah he is the absolute the owner of praise and if all the trees in the earth were pens and the sea with seven more seas to help it were ink the words of allah could not be exhausted lo allah is mighty wise your creation and your raising from the dead are only as the creation and the raising of single soul lo allah is hearer knower hast thou not seen how allah causeth the night to pass into the day and causeth the day to pass into the night and hath subdued the sun and the moon to do their work each running unto an appointed term and that allah is informed of what ye do that is so because allah he is the true and that which they invoke beside him is the false and because allah he is the sublime the great hast thou not seen how the ships glide on the sea by allah grace that he may show you of his wonders lo therein indeed are portents for every steadfast grateful heart and if wave enshroudeth them like awnings they cry unto allah making their faith pure for him only but when he bringeth them safe to land some of them compromise none denieth our signs save every traitor ingrate mankind keep your duty to your lord and fear day when the parent will not be able to avail the child in aught nor the child to avail the parent lo allah promise is the very truth let not the life of the world beguile you nor let the deceiver beguile you in regard to allah lo allah with him is knowledge of the hour he sendeth down the rain and knoweth that which is in the wombs no soul knoweth what it will earn to morrow and no soul knoweth in what land it will die lo allah is knower aware sura as sajda the prostration worship adoration alif lam mim the revelation of the scripture whereof there is no doubt is from the lord of the worlds or say they he hath invented it nay but it is the truth from thy lord that thou mayst warn folk to whom no warner came before thee that haply they may walk aright allah it is who created the heavens and the earth and that which is between them in six days then he mounted the throne ye have not beside him protecting friend or mediator will ye not then remember he directeth the ordinance from the heaven unto the earth then it ascendeth unto him in day whereof the measure is thousand years of that ye reckon such is the knower of the invisible and the visible the mighty the merciful who made all things good which he created and he began the creation of man from clay then he made his seed from draught of despised fluid then he fashioned him and breathed into him of his spirit and appointed for you hearing and sight and hearts small thanks give ye and they say when we are lost in the earth how can we then be re created nay but they are disbelievers in the meeting with their lord say the angel of death who hath charge concerning you will gather you and afterward unto your lord ye will be returned couldst thou but see when the guilty hang their heads before their lord and say our lord we have now seen and heard so send us back we will do right now we are sure and if we had so willed we could have given every soul its guidance but the word from me concerning evildoers took effect that will fill hell with the jinn and mankind together so taste the evil of your deeds forasmuch as ye forgot the meeting of this your day lo we forget you taste the doom of immortality because of what ye used to do only those believe in our revelations who when they are reminded of them fall down prostrate and hymn the praise of their lord and they are not scornful who forsake their beds to cry unto their lord in fear and hope and spend of that we have bestowed on them no soul knoweth what is kept hid for them of joy as reward for what they used to do is he who is believer like unto him who is an evil liver they are not alike but as for those who believe and do good works for them are the gardens of retreat welcome in reward for what they used to do and as for those who do evil their retreat is the fire whenever they desire to issue forth from thence they are brought back thither unto them it is said taste the torment of the fire which ye used to deny and verily we make them taste the lower punishment before the greater that haply they may return and who doth greater wrong than he who is reminded of the revelations of his lord then turneth from them lo we shall requite the guilty we verily gave moses the scripture so be not ye in doubt of his receiving it and we appointed it guidance for the children of israel and when they became steadfast and believed firmly in our revelations we appointed from among them leaders who guided by our command lo thy lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ is it not guidance for them to observe how many generations we destroyed before them amid whose dwelling places they do walk lo therein verily are portents will they not then heed have they not seen how we lead the water to the barren land and therewith bring forth crops whereof their cattle eat and they themselves will they not then see and they say when cometh this victory of yours if ye are truthful say unto them on the day of the victory the faith of those who disbelieve and who then will believe will not avail them neither will they be reprieved so withdraw from them muhammad and await the event lo they also are awaiting it sura al ahzab the clans the coalition the combined forces prophet keep thy duty to allah and obey not the disbelievers and the hypocrites lo allah is knower wise and follow that which is inspired in thee from thy lord lo allah is aware of what ye do and put thy trust in allah for allah is sufficient as trustee allah hath not assigned unto any man two hearts within his body nor hath he made your wives whom ye declare to be your mothers your mothers nor hath he made those whom ye claim to be your sons your sons this is but saying of your mouths but allah saith the truth and he showeth the way proclaim their real parentage that will be more equitable in the sight of allah and if ye know not their fathers then they are your brethren in the faith and your clients and there is no sin for you in the mistakes that ye make unintentionally but what your hearts purpose that will be sin for you allah is ever forgiving merciful the prophet is closer to the believers than their selves and his wives are as their mothers and the owners of kinship are closer one to another in the ordinance of allah than other believers and the fugitives who fled from mecca except that ye should do kindness to your friends this is written in the book of nature and when we exacted covenant from the prophets and from thee muhammad and from noah and abraham and moses and jesus son of mary we took from them solemn covenant that he may ask the loyal of their loyalty and he hath prepared painful doom for the unfaithful ye who believe remember allah favour unto you when there came against you hosts and we sent against them great wind and hosts ye could not see and allah is ever seer of what ye do when they came upon you from above you and from below you and when eyes grew wild and hearts reached to the throats and ye were imagining vain thoughts concerning allah there were the believers sorely tried and shaken with mighty shock and when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease were saying allah and his messenger promised us naught but delusion and when party of them said folk of yathrib there is no stand possible for you therefor turn back and certain of them even sought permission of the prophet saying our homes lie open to the enemy and they lay not open they but wished to flee if the enemy had entered from all sides and they had been exhorted to treachery they would have committed it and would have hesitated thereupon but little and verily they had already sworn unto allah that they would not turn their backs to the foe an oath to allah must be answered for say flight will not avail you if ye flee from death or killing and then ye dwell in comfort but little while say who is he who can preserve you from allah if he intendeth harm for you or intendeth mercy for you they will not find that they have any friend or helper other than allah allah already knoweth those of you who hinder and those who say unto their brethren come ye hither unto us and they come not to the stress of battle save little being sparing of their help to you believers but when the fear cometh then thou muhammad seest them regarding thee with rolling eyes like one who fainteth unto death then when the fear departeth they scald you with sharp tongues in their greed for wealth from the spoil such have not believed therefor allah maketh their deeds fruitless and that is easy for allah they hold that the clans have not retired for good and if the clans should advance again they would fain be in the desert with the wandering arabs asking for the news of you and if they were among you they would not give battle save little verily in the messenger of allah ye have good example for him who looketh unto allah and the last day and remembereth allah much and when the true believers saw the clans they said this is that which allah and his messenger promised us allah and his messenger are true it did but confirm them in their faith and resignation of the believers are men who are true to that which they covenanted with allah some of them have paid their vow by death in battle and some of them still are waiting and they have not altered in the least that allah may reward the true men for their truth and punish the hypocrites if he will or relent toward them if he will lo allah is forgiving merciful and allah repulsed the disbelievers in their wrath they gained no good allah averted their attack from the believers allah is ever strong mighty and he brought those of the people of the scripture who supported them down from their strongholds and cast panic into their hearts some ye slew and ye made captive some and he caused you to inherit their land and their houses and their wealth and land ye have not trodden allah is ever able to do all things prophet say unto thy wives if ye desire the world life and its adornment come will content you and will release you with fair release but if ye desire allah and his messenger and the abode of the hereafter then lo allah hath prepared for the good among you an immense reward ye wives of the prophet whosoever of you committeth manifest lewdness the punishment for her will be doubled and that is easy for allah and whosoever of you is submissive unto allah and his messenger and doeth right we shall give her her reward twice over and we have prepared for her rich provision ye wives of the prophet ye are not like any other women if ye keep your duty to allah then be not soft of speech lest he in whose heart is disease aspire to you but utter customary speech and time of and his folk of stay in your houses bedizen not yourselves with the bedizenment of the ignorance be regular in prayer and pay the poor due and obey allah messenger allah wish is but to remove uncleanness far from you the household and cleanse you with thorough cleansing and bear in mind that which is recited in your houses of the revelations of allah and wisdom lo allah is subtile aware lo men who surrender unto allah and women who surrender and men who believe and women who believe and men who obey and women who obey and men who speak the truth and women who speak the truth and men who persevere in righteousness and women who persevere and men who are humble and women who are humble and men who give alms and women who give alms and men who fast and women who fast and men who guard their modesty and women who guard their modesty and men who remember allah much and women who remember allah hath prepared for them forgiveness and vast reward and it becometh not believing man or believing woman when allah and his messenger have decided an affair for them that they should after that claim any say in their affair and whoso is rebellious to allah and his messenger he verily goeth astray in error manifest and when thou saidst unto him on whom allah hath conferred favour and thou hast conferred favour keep thy wife to thyself and fear allah and thou didst hide in thy mind that which allah was to bring to light and thou didst fear mankind whereas allah hath better right that thou shouldst fear him so when zeyd had performed that necessary formality of divorce from her we gave her unto thee in marriage so that henceforth there may be no sin for believers in respect of wives of their adopted sons when the latter have performed the necessary formality of release from them the commandment of allah must be fulfilled there is no reproach for the prophet in that which allah maketh his due that was allah way with those who passed away of old and the commandment of allah is certain destiny who delivered the messages of allah and feared him and feared none save allah allah keepeth good account muhammad is not the father of any man among you but he is the messenger of allah and the seal of the prophets and allah is ever aware of all things ye who believe remember allah with much remembrance and glorify him early and late he it is who blesseth you and his angels bless you that he may bring you forth from darkness unto light and he is ever merciful to the believers their salutation on the day when they shall meet him will be peace and he hath prepared for them goodly recompense prophet lo we have sent thee as witness and bringer of good tidings and warner and as summoner unto allah by his permission and as lamp that giveth light and announce unto the believers the good tidings that they will have great bounty from allah and incline not to the disbelievers and the hypocrites disregard their noxious talk and put thy trust in allah allah is sufficient as trustee ye who believe if ye wed believing women and divorce them before ye have touched them then there is no period that ye should reckon but content them and release them handsomely prophet lo we have made lawful unto thee thy wives unto whom thou hast paid their dowries and those whom thy right hand possesseth of those whom allah hath given thee as spoils of war and the daughters of thine uncle on the father side and the daughters of thine aunts on the father side and the daughters of thine uncle on the mother side and the daughters of thine aunts on the mother side who emigrated with thee and believing woman if she give herself unto the prophet and the prophet desire to ask her in marriage privilege for thee only not for the rest of believers we are aware of that which we enjoined upon them concerning their wives and those whom their right hands possess that thou mayst be free from blame for allah is ever forgiving merciful thou canst defer whom thou wilt of them and receive unto thee whom thou wilt and whomsoever thou desirest of those whom thou hast set aside temporarily it is no sin for thee to receive her again that is better that they may be comforted and not grieve and may all be pleased with what thou givest them allah knoweth what is in your hearts men and allah is ever forgiving clement it is not allowed thee to take other women henceforth nor that thou shouldst change them for other wives even though their beauty pleased thee save those whom thy right hand possesseth and allah is ever watcher over all things ye who believe enter not the dwellings of the prophet for meal without waiting for the proper time unless permission be granted you but if ye are invited enter and when your meal is ended then disperse linger not for conversation lo that would cause annoyance to the prophet and he would be shy of asking you to go but allah is not shy of the truth and when ye ask of them the wives of the prophet anything ask it of them from behind curtain that is purer for your hearts and for their hearts and it is not for you to cause annoyance to the messenger of allah nor that ye should ever marry his wives after him lo that in allah sight would be an enormity whether ye divulge thing or keep it hidden lo allah is ever knower of all things it is no sin for them thy wives to converse freely with their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their brothers sons or the sons of their sisters or of their own women or their slaves women keep your duty to allah lo allah is ever witness over all things lo allah and his angels shower blessings on the prophet ye who believe ask blessings on him and salute him with worthy salutation lo those who malign allah and his messenger allah hath cursed them in the world and the hereafter and hath prepared for them the doom of the disdained and those who malign believing men and believing women undeservedly they bear the guilt of slander and manifest sin prophet tell thy wives and thy daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks close round them when they go abroad that will be better so that they may be recognised and not annoyed allah is ever forgiving merciful if the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease and the alarmists in the city do not cease we verily shall urge thee on against them then they will be your neighbours in it but little while accursed they will be seized wherever found and slain with fierce slaughter that was the way of allah in the case of those who passed away of old thou wilt not find for the way of allah aught of power to change men ask thee of the hour say the knowledge of it is with allah only what can convey the knowledge unto thee it may be that the hour is nigh lo allah hath cursed the disbelievers and hath prepared for them flaming fire wherein they will abide for ever they will find then no protecting friend nor helper on the day when their faces are turned over in the fire they say oh would that we had obeyed allah and had obeyed his messenger and they say our lord lo we obeyed our princes and great men and they misled us from the way our lord oh give them double torment and curse them with mighty curse ye who believe be not as those who slandered moses but allah proved his innocence of that which they alleged and he was well esteemed in allah sight ye who believe guard your duty to allah and speak words straight to the point he will adjust your works for you and will forgive you your sins whosoever obeyeth allah and his messenger he verily hath gained signal victory lo we offered the trust unto the heavens and the earth and the hills but they shrank from bearing it and were afraid of it and man assumed it lo he hath proved tyrant and fool so allah punisheth hypocritical men and hypocritical women and idolatrous men and idolatrous women but allah pardoneth believing men and believing women and allah is ever forgiving merciful sura saba saba sheba praise be to allah unto whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth his is the praise in the hereafter and he is the wise the aware he knoweth that which goeth into the earth and that which cometh forth from it and that descendeth from the heaven and that which ascendeth into it he is the merciful the forgiving those who disbelieve say the hour will never come unto us say nay by my lord but it is coming unto you surely he is the knower of the unseen not an atom weight or less than that or greater escapeth him in the heavens or in the earth but it is in clear record that he may reward those who believe and do good works for them is pardon and rich provision but those who strive against our revelations challenging us theirs will be painful doom of wrath those who have been given knowledge see that what is revealed unto thee from thy lord is the truth and leadeth unto the path of the mighty the owner of praise those who disbelieve say shall we show you man who will tell you that when ye have become dispersed in dust with most complete dispersal still even then ye will be created anew hath he invented lie concerning allah or is there in him madness nay but those who disbelieve in the hereafter are in torment and far error have they not observed what is before them and what is behind them of the sky and the earth if we will we can make the earth swallow them or cause obliteration from the sky to fall on them lo herein surely is portent for every slave who turneth to allah repentant and assuredly we gave david grace from us saying ye hills and birds echo his psalms of praise and we made the iron supple unto him saying make thou long coats of mail and measure the links thereof and do ye right lo am seer of what ye do and unto solomon we gave the wind whereof the morning course was month journey and the evening course month journey and we caused the fount of copper to gush forth for him and we gave him certain of the jinn who worked before him by permission of his lord and such of them as deviated from our command them we caused to taste the punishment of flaming fire they made for him what he willed synagogues and statues basins like wells and boilers built into the ground give thanks house of david few of my bondmen are thankful and when we decreed death for him nothing showed his death to them save creeping creature of the earth which gnawed away his staff and when he fell the jinn saw clearly how if they had known the unseen they would not have continued in despised toil there was indeed sign for sheba in their dwelling place two gardens on the right hand and the left as who should say eat of the provision of your lord and render thanks to him fair land and an indulgent lord but they were froward so we sent on them the flood of iram and in exchange for their two gardens gave them two gardens bearing bitter fruit the tamarisk and here and there lote tree this we awarded them because of their ingratitude punish we ever any save the ingrates and we set between them and the towns which we had blessed towns easy to be seen and we made the stage between them easy saying travel in them safely both by night and day but they said our lord make the stage between our journeys longer and they wronged themselves therefore we made them bywords in the land and scattered them abroad total scattering lo herein verily are portents for each steadfast grateful heart and satan indeed found his calculation true concerning them for they follow him all save group of true believers and he had no warrant whatsoever against them save that we would know him who believeth in the hereafter from him who is in doubt thereof and thy lord muhammad taketh note of all things say muhammad call upon those whom ye set up beside allah they possess not an atom weight either in the heavens or in the earth nor have they any share in either nor hath he an auxiliary among them no intercession availeth with him save for him whom he permitteth yet when fear is banished from their hearts they say what was it that your lord said they say the truth and he is the sublime the great say who giveth you provision from the sky and the earth say allah lo we or you assuredly are rightly guided or in error manifest say ye will not be asked of what we committed nor shall we be asked of what ye do say our lord will bring us all together then he will judge between us with truth he is the all knowing judge say show me those whom ye have joined unto him as partners nay ye dare not for he is allah the mighty the wise and we have not sent thee muhammad save as bringer of good tidings and warner unto all mankind but most of mankind know not and they say when is this promise to be fulfilled if ye are truthful say muhammad yours is the promise of day which ye cannot postpone nor hasten by an hour and those who disbelieve say we believe not in this qur an nor in that which was before it but oh if thou couldst see when the wrong doers are brought up before their lord how they cast the blame one to another how those who were despised in the earth say unto those who were proud but for you we should have been believers those who were proud say unto those who were despised did we drive you away from the guidance after it had come unto you nay but ye were guilty those who were despised say unto those who were proud nay but it was your scheming night and day when ye commanded us to disbelieve in allah and set up rivals unto him and they are filled with remorse when they behold the doom and we place carcans on the necks of those who disbelieved are they requited aught save what they used to do and we sent not unto any township warner but its pampered ones declared lo we are disbelievers in that wherewith ye have been sent and they say we are more than you in wealth and children we are not the punished say muhammad lo my lord enlargeth the provision for whom he will and narroweth it for whom he will but most of mankind know not and it is not your wealth nor your children that will bring you near unto us but he who believeth and doeth good he draweth near as for such theirs will be twofold reward for what they did and they will dwell secure in lofty halls and as for those who strive against our revelations challenging they will be brought to the doom say lo my lord enlargeth the provision for whom he will of his bondmen and narroweth it for him and whatsoever ye spend for good he replaceth it and he is the best of providers and on the day when he will gather them all together he will say unto the angels did these worship you they will say be thou glorified thou alone art our guardian not them nay but they worshipped the jinn most of them were believers in them that day ye will possess no use nor hurt one for another and we shall say unto those who did wrong taste the doom of the fire which ye used to deny and if our revelations are recited unto them in plain terms they say this is naught else than man who would turn you away from what your fathers used to worship and they say this is naught else than an invented lie those who disbelieve say of the truth when it reacheth them this is naught else than mere magic and we have given them no scriptures which they study nor sent we unto them before thee any warner those before them denied and these have not attained tithe of that which we bestowed on them of old yet they denied my messengers how intense then was my abhorrence of them say unto them muhammad exhort you unto one thing only that ye awake for allah sake by twos and singly and then reflect there is no madness in your comrade he is naught else than warner unto you in face of terrific doom say whatever reward might have asked of you is yours my reward is the affair of allah only he is witness over all things say lo my lord hurleth the truth he is the knower of things hidden say the truth hath come and falsehood showeth not its face and will not return say if err err only to my own loss and if am rightly guided it is because of that which my lord hath revealed unto me lo he is hearer nigh couldst thou but see when they are terrified with no escape and are seized from near at hand and say we now believe therein but how can they reach faith from afar off when they disbelieved in it of yore they aim at the unseen from afar off and gulf is set between them and that which they desire as was done for people of their kind of old lo they were in hopeless doubt sura fatir the angels orignator praise be to allah the creator of the heavens and the earth who appointeth the angels messengers having wings two three and four he multiplieth in creation what he will lo allah is able to do all things that which allah openeth unto mankind of mercy none can withhold it and that which he withholdeth none can release thereafter he is the mighty the wise mankind remember allah grace toward you is there any creator other than allah who provideth for you from the sky and the earth there is no allah save him whither then are ye turned and if they deny thee muhammad messengers of allah were denied before thee unto allah all things are brought back mankind lo the promise of allah is true so let not the life of the world beguile you and let not the avowed beguiler beguile you with regard to allah lo the devil is an enemy for you so treat him as an enemy he only summoneth his faction to be owners of the flaming fire those who disbelieve theirs will be an awful doom and those who believe and do good works theirs will be forgiveness and great reward is he the evil of whose deeds is made fairseeming unto him so that he deemeth it good other than satan dupe allah verily sendeth whom he will astray and guideth whom he will so let not thy soul expire in sighings for them lo allah is aware of what they do and allah it is who sendeth the winds and they raise cloud then we lead it unto dead land and revive therewith the earth after its death such is the resurrection whoso desireth power should know that all power belongeth to allah unto him good words ascend and the pious deed doth he exalt but those who plot iniquities theirs will be an awful doom and the plotting of such folk will come to naught allah created you from dust then from little fluid then he made you pairs the male and female no female beareth or bringeth forth save with his knowledge and no one groweth old who groweth old nor is aught lessened of his life but it is recorded in book lo that is easy for allah and the two seas are not alike this fresh sweet good to drink this other bitter salt and from them both ye eat fresh meat and derive the ornament that ye wear and thou seest the ship cleaving them with its prow that ye may seek of his bounty and that haply ye may give thanks he maketh the night to pass into the day and he maketh the day to pass into the night he hath subdued the sun and moon to service each runneth unto an appointed term such is allah your lord his is the sovereignty and those unto whom ye pray instead of him own not so much as the white spot on date stone if ye pray unto them they hear not your prayer and if they heard they could not grant it you on the day of resurrection they will disown association with you none can inform you like him who is aware mankind ye are the poor in your relation to allah and allah he is the absolute the owner of praise if he will he can be rid of you and bring instead of you some new creation that is not hard thing for allah and no burdened soul can bear another burden and if one heavy laden crieth for help with his load naught of it will be lifted even though he unto whom he crieth be of kin thou warnest only those who fear their lord in secret and have established worship he who groweth in goodness groweth only for himself he cannot by his merit redeem others unto allah is the journeying the blind man is not equal with the seer nor is darkness tantamount to light nor is the shadow equal with the sun full heat nor are the living equal with the dead lo allah maketh whom he will to hear thou canst not reach those who are in the graves thou art but warner lo we have sent thee with the truth bearer of glad tidings and warner and there is not nation but warner hath passed among them and if they deny thee those before them also denied their messengers came unto them with clear proofs of allah sovereignty and with the psalms and the scripture giving light then seized those who disbelieved and how intense was my abhorrence hast thou not seen that allah causeth water to fall from the sky and we produce therewith fruit of divers hues and among the hills are streaks white and red of divers hues and others raven black and of men and beasts and cattle in like manner divers hues the erudite among his bondmen fear allah alone lo allah is mighty forgiving lo those who read the scripture of allah and establish worship and spend of that which we have bestowed on them secretly and openly they look forward to imperishable gain that he will pay them their wages and increase them of his grace lo he is forgiving responsive as for that which we inspire in thee of the scripture it is the truth confirming that which was revealed before it lo allah is indeed observer seer of his slaves then we gave the scripture as inheritance unto those whom we elected of our bondmen but of them are some who wrong themselves and of them are some who are lukewarm and of them are some who outstrip others through good deeds by allah leave that is the great favour gardens of eden they enter them wearing armlets of gold and pearl and their raiment therein is silk and they say praise be to allah who hath put grief away from us lo our lord is forgiving bountiful who of his grace hath installed us in the mansion of eternity where toil toucheth us not nor can weariness affect us but as for those who disbelieve for them is fire of hell it taketh not complete effect upon them so that they can die nor is its torment lightened for them thus we punish every ingrate and they cry for help there saying our lord release us we will do right not the wrong that we used to do did not we grant you life long enough for him who reflected to reflect therein and the warner came unto you now taste the flavour of your deeds for evil doers have no helper lo allah is the knower of the unseen of the heavens and the earth lo he is aware of the secret of men breasts he it is who hath made you regents in the earth so he who disbelieveth his disbelief be on his own head their disbelief increaseth for the disbelievers in their lord sight naught save abhorrence their disbelief increaseth for the disbelievers naught save loss say have ye seen your partner gods to whom ye pray beside allah show me what they created of the earth or have they any portion in the heavens or have we given them scripture so they act on clear proof therefrom nay the evildoers promise one another only to deceive lo allah graspeth the heavens and the earth that they deviate not and if they were to deviate there is not one that could grasp them after him lo he is ever clement forgiving and they swore by allah their most binding oath that if warner came unto them they would be more tractable than any of the nations yet when warner came unto them it aroused in them naught save repugnance shown in their behaving arrogantly in the land and plotting evil and the evil plot encloseth but the men who make it then can they expect aught save the treatment of the folk of old thou wilt not find for allah way of treatment any substitute nor wilt thou find for allah way of treatment aught of power to change have they not travelled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence for those who were before them and they were mightier than these in power allah is not such that aught in the heavens or in the earth escapeth him lo he is the wise the mighty if allah took mankind to task by that which they deserve he would not leave living creature on the surface of the earth but he reprieveth them unto an appointed term and when their term cometh then verily they will know that allah is ever seer of his slaves sura ya seen ya seen ya sin by the wise qur an lo thou art of those sent on straight path revelation of the mighty the merciful that thou mayst warn folk whose fathers were not warned so they are heedless already hath the judgment for their infidelity proved true of most of them for they believe not lo we have put on their necks carcans reaching unto the chins so that they are made stiff necked and we have set bar before them and bar behind them and thus have covered them so that they see not whether thou warn them or thou warn them not it is alike for them for they believe not thou warnest only him who followeth the reminder and feareth the beneficent in secret to him bear tidings of forgiveness and rich reward lo we it is who bring the dead to life we record that which they send before them and their footprints and all things we have kept in clear register coin for them similitude the people of the city when those sent from allah came unto them when we sent unto them twain and they denied them both so we reinforced them with third and they said lo we have been sent unto you they said ye are but mortals like unto us the beneficent hath naught revealed ye do but lie they answered our lord knoweth that we are indeed sent unto you and our duty is but plain conveyance of the message the people of the city said we augur ill of you if ye desist not we shall surely stone you and grievous torture will befall you at our hands they said your evil augury be with you is it because ye are reminded of the truth nay but ye are froward folk and there came from the uttermost part of the city man running he cried my people follow those who have been sent follow those who ask of you no fee and who are rightly guided for what cause should not serve him who hath created me and unto whom ye will be brought back shall take other gods in place of him when if the beneficent should wish me any harm their intercession will avail me naught nor can they save then truly should be in error manifest lo have believed in your lord so hear me it was said unto him enter paradise he said would that my people knew with what munificence my lord hath pardoned me and made me of the honoured ones we sent not down against his people after him host from heaven nor do we ever send it was but one shout and lo they were extinct ah the anguish for the bondmen never came there unto them messenger but they did mock him have they not seen how many generations we destroyed before them which indeed returned not unto them but all without exception will be brought before us token unto them is the dead earth we revive it and we bring forth from it grain so that they eat thereof and we have placed therein gardens of the date palm and grapes and we have caused springs of water to gush forth therein that they may eat of the fruit thereof and their hands made it not will they not then give thanks glory be to him who created all the sexual pairs of that which the earth groweth and of themselves and of that which they know not token unto them is night we strip it of the day and lo they are in darkness and the sun runneth on unto resting place for him that is the measuring of the mighty the wise and for the moon we have appointed mansions till she return like an old shrivelled palm leaf it is not for the sun to overtake the moon nor doth the night outstrip the day they float each in an orbit and token unto them is that we bear their offspring in the laden ship and have created for them of the like thereof whereon they ride and if we will we drown them and there is no help for them neither can they be saved unless by mercy from us and as comfort for while when it is said unto them beware of that which is before you and that which is behind you that haply ye may find mercy they are heedless never came token of the tokens of their lord to them but they did turn away from it and when it is said unto them spend of that wherewith allah hath provided you those who disbelieve say unto those who believe shall we feed those whom allah if he willed would feed ye are in naught else than error manifest and they say when will this promise be fulfilled if ye are truthful they await but one shout which will surprise them while they are disputing then they cannot make bequest nor can they return to their own folk and the trumpet is blown and lo from the graves they hie unto their lord crying woe upon us who hath raised us from our place of sleep this is that which the beneficent did promise and the messengers spoke truth it is but one shout and behold them brought together before us this day no soul is wronged in aught nor are ye requited aught save what ye used to do lo those who merit paradise this day are happily employed they and their wives in pleasant shade on thrones reclining theirs the fruit of their good deeds and theirs all that they ask the word from merciful lord for them is peace but avaunt ye ye guilty this day did not charge you ye sons of adam that ye worship not the devil lo he is your open foe but that ye worship me that was the right path yet he hath led astray of you great multitude had ye then no sense this is hell which ye were promised if ye followed him burn therein this day for that ye disbelieved this day we seal up their mouths and their hands speak out to us and their feet bear witness as to what they used to earn and had we willed we verily could have quenched their eyesight so that they should struggle for the way then how could they have seen and had we willed we verily could have fixed them in their place making them powerless to go forward or turn back he whom we bring unto old age we reverse him in creation making him go back to weakness after strength have ye then no sense and we have not taught him muhammad poetry nor is it meet for him this is naught else than reminder and lecture making plain to warn whosoever liveth and that the word may be fulfilled against the disbelievers have they not seen how we have created for them of our handiwork the cattle so that they are their owners and have subdued them unto them so that some of them they have for riding some for food benefits and divers drinks have they from them will they not then give thanks and they have taken other gods beside allah in order that they may be helped it is not in their power to help them but they the worshippers are unto them host in arms so let not their speech grieve thee muhammad lo we know what they conceal and what proclaim hath not man seen that we have created him from drop of seed yet lo he is an open opponent and he hath coined for us similitude and hath forgotten the fact of his creation saying who will revive these bones when they have rotted away say he will revive them who produced them at the first for he is knower of every creation who hath appointed for you fire from the green tree and behold ye kindle from it is not he who created the heavens and the earth able to create the like of them aye that he is for he is the all wise creator but his command when he intendeth thing is only that he saith unto it be and it is therefor glory be to him in whose hand is the dominion over all things unto him ye will be brought back sura as saaffat those who set the ranks drawn up in ranks by those who set the ranks in battle order and those who drive away the wicked with reproof and those who read the word for reminder lo thy lord is surely one lord of the heavens and of the earth and all that is between them and lord of the sun risings lo we have adorned the lowest heaven with an ornament the planets with security from every froward devil they cannot listen to the highest chiefs for they are pelted from every side outcast and theirs is perpetual torment save him who snatcheth fragment and there pursueth him piercing flame then ask them muhammad are they stronger as creation or those others whom we have created lo we created them of plastic clay nay but thou dost marvel when they mock and heed not when they are reminded and seek to scoff when they behold portent and they say lo this is mere magic when we are dead and have become dust and bones shall we then forsooth be raised again and our forefathers say muhammad ye in truth and ye will be brought low there is but one shout and lo they behold and say ah woe for us this is the day of judgment this is the day of separation which ye used to deny and it is said unto the angels assemble those who did wrong together with their wives and what they used to worship instead of allah and lead them to the path to hell and stop them for they must be questioned what aileth you that ye help not one another nay but this day they make full submission and some of them draw near unto others mutually questioning they say lo ye used to come unto us imposing swearing that ye spoke the truth they answer nay but ye yourselves were not believers we had no power over you but ye were wayward folk now the word of our lord hath been fulfilled concerning us lo we are about to taste the doom thus we misled you lo we were ourselves astray then lo this day they both are sharers in the doom lo thus deal we with the guilty for when it was said unto them there is no allah save allah they were scornful and said shall we forsake our gods for mad poet nay but he brought the truth and he confirmed those sent before him lo now verily ye taste the painful doom ye are requited naught save what ye did save single minded slaves of allah for them there is known provision fruits and they will be honoured in the gardens of delight on couches facing one another cup from gushing spring is brought round for them white delicious to the drinkers wherein there is no headache nor are they made mad thereby and with them are those of modest gaze with lovely eyes pure as they were hidden eggs of the ostrich and some of them draw near unto others mutually questioning speaker of them saith lo had comrade who used to say art thou in truth of those who put faith in his words can we when we are dead and have become mere dust and bones can we then verily be brought to book he saith will ye look then looketh he and seeth him in the depth of hell he saith by allah thou verily didst all but cause my ruin and had it not been for the favour of my lord too had been of those haled forth to doom are we then not to die saving our former death and are we not to be punished lo this is the supreme triumph for the like of this then let the workers work is this better as welcome or the tree of zaqqum lo we have appointed it torment for wrong doers lo it is tree that springeth in the heart of hell its crop is as it were the heads of devils and lo they verily must eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith and afterward lo thereupon they have drink of boiling water and afterward lo their return is surely unto hell they indeed found their fathers astray but they make haste to follow in their footsteps and verily most of the men of old went astray before them and verily we sent among them warners then see the nature of the consequence for those warned save single minded slaves of allah and noah verily prayed unto us and gracious was the hearer of his prayer and we saved him and his household from the great distress and made his seed the survivors and left for him among the later folk the salutation peace be unto noah among the peoples lo thus do we reward the good lo he is one of our believing slaves then we did drown the others and lo of his persuasion verily was abraham when he came unto his lord with whole heart when he said unto his father and his folk what is it that ye worship is it falsehood gods beside allah that ye desire what then is your opinion of the lord of the worlds and he glanced glance at the stars then said lo feel sick and they turned their backs and went away from him then turned he to their gods and said will ye not eat what aileth you that ye speak not then he attacked them striking with his right hand and his people came toward him hastening he said worship ye that which ye yourselves do carve when allah hath created you and what ye make they said build for him building and fling him in the red hotfire and they designed snare for him but we made them the undermost and he said lo am going unto my lord who will guide me my lord vouchsafe me of the righteous so we gave him tidings of gentle son and when his son was old enough to walk with him abraham said my dear son have seen in dream that must sacrifice thee so look what thinkest thou he said my father do that which thou art commanded allah willing thou shalt find me of the steadfast then when they had both surrendered to allah and he had flung him down upon his face we called unto him abraham thou hast already fulfilled the vision lo thus do we reward the good lo that verily was clear test then we ransomed him with tremendous victim and we left for him among the later folk the salutation peace be unto abraham thus do we reward the good lo he is one of our believing slaves and we gave him tidings of the birth of isaac prophet of the righteous and we blessed him and isaac and of their seed are some who do good and some who plainly wrong themselves and we verily gave grace unto moses and aaron and saved them and their people from the great distress and helped them so that they became the victors and we gave them the clear scripture and showed them the right path and we left for them among the later folk the salutation peace be unto moses and aaron lo thus do we reward the good lo they are two of our believing slaves and lo elias was of those sent to warn when he said unto his folk will ye not ward off evil will ye cry unto baal and forsake the best of creators allah your lord and lord of your forefathers but they denied him so they surely will be haled forth to the doom save single minded slaves of allah and we left for him among the later folk the salutation peace be unto elias lo thus do we reward the good lo he is one of our believing slaves and lo lot verily was of those sent to warn when we saved him and his household every one save an old woman among those who stayed behind then we destroyed the others and lo ye verily pass by the ruin of them in the morning and at night time have ye then no sense and lo jonah verily was of those sent to warn when he fled unto the laden ship and then drew lots and was of those rejected and the fish swallowed him while he was blameworthy and had he not been one of those who glorify allah he would have tarried in its belly till the day when they are raised then we cast him on desert shore while he was sick and we caused tree of gourd to grow above him and we sent him to hundred thousand folk or more and they believed therefor we gave them comfort for while now ask them muhammad hath thy lord daughters whereas they have sons or created we the angels females while they were present lo it is of their falsehood that they say allah hath begotten allah verily they tell lie and again of their falsehood he hath preferred daughters to sons what aileth you how judge ye will ye not then reflect or have ye clear warrant then produce your writ if ye are truthful and they imagine kinship between him and the jinn whereas the jinn know well that they will be brought before him glorified be allah from that which they attribute unto him save single minded slaves of allah lo verily ye and that which ye worship ye cannot excite anyone against him save him who is to burn in hell there is not one of us but hath his known position lo we even we are they who set the ranks lo we even we are they who hymn his praise and indeed they used to say if we had but reminder from the men of old we would be single minded slaves of allah yet now that it is come they disbelieve therein but they will come to know and verily our word went forth of old unto our bondmen sent to warn that they verily would be helped and that our host they verily would be the victors so withdraw from them muhammad awhile and watch for they will soon see would they hasten on our doom but when it cometh home to them then it will be hapless morn for those who have been warned withdraw from them awhile and watch for they will soon see glorified be thy lord the lord of majesty from that which they attribute unto him and peace be unto those sent to warn and praise be to allah lord of the worlds sura sad the letter sad sad by the renowned qur an nay but those who disbelieve are in false pride and schism how many generation we destroyed before them and they cried out when it was no longer the time for escape and they marvel that warner from among themselves hath come unto them and the disbelievers say this is wizard charlatan maketh he the gods one allah lo that is an astounding thing the chiefs among them go about exhorting go and be staunch to your gods lo this is thing designed we have not heard of this in later religion this is naught but an invention hath the reminder been unto him alone among us nay but they are in doubt concerning my reminder nay but they have not yet tasted my doom or are theirs the treasures of the mercy of thy lord the mighty the bestower or is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them theirs then let them ascend by ropes defeated host are all the factions that are there the folk of noah before them denied their messenger and so did the tribe of ad and pharaoh firmly planted and the tribe of thamud and the folk of lot and the dwellers in the wood these were the factions not one of them but did deny the messengers therefor my doom was justified these wait for but one shout there will be no second thereto they say our lord hasten on for us our fate before the day of reckoning bear with what they say and remember our bondman david lord of might lo he was ever turning in repentance toward allah lo we subdued the hills to hymn the praises of their lord with him at nightfall and sunrise and the birds assembled all were turning unto him we made his kingdom strong and gave him wisdom and decisive speech and hath the story of the litigants come unto thee how they climbed the wall into the royal chamber how they burst in upon david and he was afraid of them they said be not afraid we are two litigants one of whom hath wronged the other therefor judge aright between us be not unjust and show us the fair way lo this my brother hath ninety and nine ewes while had one ewe and he said entrust it to me and he conquered me in speech david said he hath wronged thee in demanding thine ewe in addition to his ewes and lo many partners oppress one another save such as believe and do good works and they are few and david guessed that we had tried him and he sought forgiveness of his lord and he bowed himself and fell down prostrate and repented so we forgave him that and lo he had access to our presence and happy journey end and it was said unto him david lo we have set thee as viceroy in the earth therefor judge aright between mankind and follow not desire that it beguile thee from the way of allah lo those who wander from the way of allah have an awful doom forasmuch as they forgot the day of reckoning and we created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them in vain that is the opinion of those who disbelieve and woe unto those who disbelieve from the fire shall we treat those who believe and do good works as those who spread corruption in the earth or shall we treat the pious as the wicked this is scripture that we have revealed unto thee full of blessing that they may ponder its revelations and that men of understanding may reflect and we bestowed on david solomon how excellent slave lo he was ever turning in repentance toward allah when there were shown to him at eventide lightfooted coursers and he said lo have preferred the good things of the world to the remembrance of my lord till they were taken out of sight behind the curtain then he said bring them back to me and fell to slashing with his sword their legs and necks and verily we tried solomon and set upon his throne mere body then did he repent he said my lord forgive me and bestow on me sovereignty such as shall not belong to any after me lo thou art the bestower so we made the wind subservient unto him setting fair by his command whithersoever he intended and the unruly every builder and diver made we subservient and others linked together in chains saying this is our gift so bestow thou or withhold without reckoning and lo he hath favour with us and happy journey end and make mention muhammad of our bondman job when he cried unto his lord saying lo the devil doth afflict me with distress and torment and it was said unto him strike the ground with thy foot this spring is cool bath and refreshing drink and we bestowed on him again his household and therewith the like thereof mercy from us and memorial for men of understanding and it was said unto him take in thine hand branch and smite therewith and break not thine oath lo we found him steadfast how excellent slave lo he was ever turning in repentance to his lord and make mention of our bondmen abraham isaac and jacob men of parts and vision lo we purified them with pure thought remembrance of the home of the hereafter lo in our sight they are verily of the elect the excellent and make mention of ishmael and elisha and dhu kifl all are of the chosen this is reminder and lo for those who ward off evil is happy journey end gardens of eden whereof the gates are opened for them wherein reclining they call for plenteous fruit and cool drink that is therein and with them are those of modest gaze companions this it is that ye are promised for the day of reckoning lo this in truth is our provision which will never waste away this is for the righteous and lo for the transgressors there with be an evil journey end hell where they will burn an evil resting place here is boiling and an ice cold draught so let them taste it and other torment of the kind in pairs the two extremes here is an army rushing blindly with you those who are already in the fire say no word of welcome for them lo they will roast at the fire they say nay but you misleaders for you there is no word of welcome ye prepared this for us by your misleading now hapless is the plight they say our lord whoever did prepare this for us oh give him double portion of the fire and they say what aileth us that we behold not men whom we were wont to count among the wicked did we take them wrongly for laughing stock or have our eyes missed them lo that is very truth the wrangling of the dwellers in the fire say unto them muhammad am only warner and there is no allah save allah the one the absolute lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them the mighty the pardoning say it is tremendous tidings whence ye turn away had no knowledge of the highest chiefs when they disputed it is revealed unto me only that may be plain warner when thy lord said unto the angels lo am about to create mortal out of mire and when have fashioned him and breathed into him of my spirit then fall down before him prostrate the angels fell down prostrate every one saving iblis he was scornful and became one of the disbelievers he said iblis what hindereth thee from falling prostrate before that which have created with both my hands art thou too proud or art thou of the high exalted he said am better than him thou createdst me of fire whilst him thou didst create of clay he said go forth from hence for lo thou art outcast and lo my curse is on thee till the day of judgment he said my lord reprieve me till the day when they are raised he said lo thou art of those reprieved until the day of the time appointed he said then by thy might surely will beguile them every one save thy single minded slaves among them he said the truth is and the truth speak that shall fill hell with thee and with such of them as follow thee together say muhammad unto mankind ask of you no fee for this and am no simulating lo it is naught else than reminder for all peoples and ye will come in time to know the truth thereof sura az zumar the troops throngs the revelation of the scripture is from allah the mighty the wise lo we have revealed the scripture unto thee muhammad with truth so worship allah making religion pure for him only surely pure religion is for allah only and those who choose protecting friends beside him say we worship them only that they may bring us near unto allah lo allah will judge between them concerning that wherein they differ lo allah guideth not him who is liar an ingrate if allah had willed to choose son he could have chosen what he would of that which he hath created be he glorified he is allah the one the absolute he hath created the heavens and the earth with truth he maketh night to succeed day and he maketh day to succeed night and he constraineth the sun and the moon to give service each running on for an appointed term is not he the mighty the forgiver he created you from one being then from that being he made its mate and he hath provided for you of cattle eight kinds he created you in the wombs of your mothers creation after creation in threefold gloom such is allah your lord his is the sovereignty there is no allah save him how then are ye turned away if ye are thankless yet allah is independent of you though he is not pleased with thanklessness for his bondmen and if ye are thankful he is pleased therewith for you no laden soul will bear another load then unto your lord is your return and he will tell you what ye used to do lo he knoweth what is in the breasts of men and when some hurt toucheth man he crieth unto his lord turning unto him repentant then when he granteth him boon from him he forgetteth that for which he cried unto him before and setteth up rivals to allah that he may beguile men from his way say muhammad unto such an one take pleasure in thy disbelief while lo thou art of the owners of the fire is he who payeth adoration in the watches of the night prostrate and standing bewaring of the hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his lord to be accounted equal with disbeliever say unto them muhammad are those who know equal with those who know not but only men of understanding will pay heed say my bondmen who believe observe your duty to your lord for those who do good in this world there is good and allah earth is spacious verily the steadfast will be paid their wages without stint say muhammad lo am commanded to worship allah making religion pure for him only and am commanded to be the first of those who are muslims surrender unto him say lo if should disobey my lord fear the doom of tremendous day say allah worship making my religion pure for him only then worship what ye will beside him say the losers will be those who lose themselves and their housefolk on the day of resurrection ah that will be the manifest loss they have an awning of fire above them and beneath them dais of fire with this doth allah appal his bondmen my bondmen therefor fear me and those who put away false gods lest they should worship them and turn to allah in repentance for them there are glad tidings therefor give good tidings muhammad to my bondmen who hear advice and follow the best thereof such are those whom allah guideth and such are men of understanding is he on whom the word of doom is fulfilled to be helped and canst thou muhammad rescue him who is in the fire but those who keep their duty to their lord for them are lofty halls with lofty halls above them built for them beneath which rivers flow it is promise of allah allah faileth not his promise hast thou not seen how allah hath sent down water from the sky and hath caused it to penetrate the earth as watersprings and afterward thereby produceth crops of divers hues and afterward they wither and thou seest them turn yellow then he maketh them chaff lo herein verily is reminder for men of understanding is he whose bosom allah hath expanded for al islam so that he followeth light from his lord as he who disbelieveth then woe unto those whose hearts are hardened against remembrance of allah such are in plain error allah hath now revealed the fairest of statements scripture consistent wherein promises of reward are paired with threats of punishment whereat doth creep the flesh of those who fear their lord so that their flesh and their hearts soften to allah reminder such is allah guidance wherewith he guideth whom he will and him whom allah sendeth astray for him there is no guide is he then who will strike his face against the awful doom upon the day of resurrection as he who doeth right and it will be said unto the wrong doers taste what ye used to earn those before them denied and so the doom came on them whence they knew not thus allah made them taste humiliation in the life of the world and verily the doom of the hereafter will be greater if they did but know and verily we have coined for mankind in this qur an all kinds of similitudes that haply they may reflect lecture in arabic containing no crookedness that haply they may ward off evil allah coineth similitude man in relation to whom are several partowners quarrelling and man belonging wholly to one man are the two equal in similitude praise be to allah but most of them know not lo thou wilt die and lo they will die then lo on the day of resurrection before your lord ye will dispute and who doth greater wrong than he who telleth lie against allah and denieth the truth when it reacheth him will not the home of disbelievers be in hell and whoso bringeth the truth and believeth therein such are the dutiful they shall have what they will of their lord bounty that is the reward of the good that allah will remit from them the worst of what they did and will pay them for reward the best they used to do will not allah defend his slave yet they would frighten thee with those beside him he whom allah sendeth astray for him there is no guide and he whom allah guideth for him there can be no misleader is not allah mighty able to requite the wrong and verily if thou shouldst ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will say allah say bethink you then of those ye worship beside allah if allah willed some hurt for me could they remove from me his hurt or if he willed some mercy for me could they restrain his mercy say allah is my all in him do all the trusting put their trust say my people act in your manner lo too am acting thus ye will come to know who it is unto whom cometh doom that will abase him and on whom there falleth everlasting doom lo we have revealed unto thee muhammad the scripture for mankind with truth then whosoever goeth right it is for his soul and whosoever strayeth strayeth only to its hurt and thou art not warder over them allah receiveth men souls at the time of their death and that soul which dieth not yet in its sleep he keepeth that soul for which he hath ordained death and dismisseth the rest till an appointed term lo herein verily are portents for people who take thought or choose they intercessors other than allah say what even though they have power over nothing and have no intelligence say unto allah belongeth all intercession his is the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and afterward unto him ye will be brought back and when allah alone is mentioned the hearts of those who believe not in the hereafter are repelled and when those whom they worship beside him are mentioned behold they are glad say allah creator of the heavens and the earth knower of the invisible and the visible thou wilt judge between thy slaves concerning that wherein they used to differ and though those who do wrong possess all that is in the earth and therewith as much again they verily will seek to ransom themselves therewith on the day of resurrection from the awful doom and there will appear unto them from their lord that wherewith they never reckoned and the evils that they earned will appear unto them and that whereat they used to scoff will surround them now when hurt toucheth man he crieth unto us and afterward when we have granted him boon from us he saith only by force of knowledge obtained it nay but it is test but most of them know not those before them said it yet all that they had earned availed them not but the evils that they earned smote them and such of these as do wrong the evils that they earn will smite them they cannot escape know they not that allah enlargeth providence for whom he will and straiteneth it for whom he will lo herein verily are portents for people who believe say my slaves who have been prodigal to their own hurt despair not of the mercy of allah who forgiveth all sins lo he is the forgiving the merciful turn unto your lord repentant and surrender unto him before there come unto you the doom when ye cannot be helped and follow the better guidance of that which is revealed unto you from your lord before the doom cometh on you suddenly when ye know not lest any soul should say alas my grief that was unmindful of allah and was indeed among the scoffers or should say if allah had but guided me should have been among the dutiful or should say when it seeth the doom oh that had but second chance that might be among the righteous but now the answer will be nay for my revelations came unto thee but thou didst deny them and wast scornful and wast among the disbelievers and on the day of resurrection thou muhammad seest those who lied concerning allah with their faces blackened is not the home of the scorners in hell and allah delivereth those who ward off evil because of their deserts evil toucheth them not nor do they grieve allah is creator of all things and he is guardian over all things his are the keys of the heavens and the earth and they who disbelieve the revelations of allah such are they who are the losers say muhammad to the disbelievers do ye bid me serve other than allah ye fools and verily it hath been revealed unto thee as unto those before thee saying if thou ascribe partner to allah thy work will fail and thou indeed wilt be among the losers nay but allah must thou serve and be among the thankful and they esteem not allah as he hath the right to be esteemed when the whole earth is his handful on the day of resurrection and the heavens are rolled in his right hand glorified is he and high exalted from all that they ascribe as partner unto him and the trumpet is blown and all who are in the heavens and all who are in the earth swoon away save him whom allah willeth then it is blown second time and behold them standing waiting and the earth shineth with the light of her lord and the book is set up and the prophets and the witnesses are brought and it is judged between them with truth and they are not wronged and each soul is paid in full for what it did and he is best aware of what they do and those who disbelieve are driven unto hell in troops till when they reach it and the gates thereof are opened and the warders thereof say unto them came there not unto you messengers of your own reciting unto you the revelations of your lord and warning you of the meeting of this your day they say yea verily but the word of doom of disbelievers is fulfilled it is said unto them enter ye the gates of hell to dwell therein thus hapless is the journey end of the scorners and those who keep their duty to their lord are driven unto the garden in troops till when they reach it and the gates thereof are opened and the warders thereof say unto them peace be unto you ye are good so enter ye the garden of delight to dwell therein they say praise be to allah who hath fulfilled his promise unto us and hath made us inherit the land sojourning in the garden where we will so bounteous is the wage of workers and thou muhammad seest the angels thronging round the throne hymning the praises of their lord and they are judged aright and it is said praise be to allah the lord of the worlds sura al ghafir the forgiver god ha mim the revelation of the scripture is from allah the mighty the knower the forgiver of sin the accepter of repentance the stern in punishment the bountiful there is no allah save him unto him is the journeying none argue concerning the revelations of allah save those who disbelieve so let not their turn of fortune in the land deceive thee muhammad the folk of noah and the factions after them denied their messengers before these and every nation purposed to seize their messenger and argued falsely thinking thereby to refute the truth then seized them and how awful was my punishment thus was the word of thy lord concerning those who disbelieve fulfilled that they are owners of the fire those who bear the throne and all who are round about it hymn the praises of their lord and believe in him and ask forgiveness for those who believe saying our lord thou comprehendest all things in mercy and knowledge therefor forgive those who repent and follow thy way ward off from them the punishment of hell our lord and make them enter the gardens of eden which thou hast promised them with such of their fathers and their wives and their descendants as do right lo thou only thou art the mighty the wise and ward off from them ill deeds and he from whom thou wardest off ill deeds that day him verily hast thou taken into mercy that is the supreme triumph lo on that day those who disbelieve are informed by proclamation verily allah abhorrence is more terrible than your abhorrence one of another when ye were called unto the faith but did refuse they say our lord twice hast thou made us die and twice hast thou made us live now we confess our sins is there any way to go out it is said unto them this is your plight because when allah only was invoked ye disbelieved but when some partner was ascribed to him ye were believing but the command belongeth only to allah the sublime the majestic he it is who showeth you his portents and sendeth down for you provision from the sky none payeth heed save him who turneth unto him repentant therefor believers pray unto allah making religion pure for him only however much the disbelievers be averse the exalter of ranks the lord of the throne he causeth the spirit of his command upon whom he will of his slaves that he may warn of the day of meeting the day when they come forth nothing of them being hidden from allah whose is the sovereignty this day it is allah the one the almighty this day is each soul requited that which it hath earned no wrong is done this day lo allah is swift at reckoning warn them muhammad of the day of the approaching doom when the hearts will be choking the throats when there will be no friend for the wrong doers nor any intercessor who will be heard he knoweth the traitor of the eyes and that which the bosoms hide allah judgeth with truth while those to whom they cry instead of him judge not at all lo allah he is the hearer the seer have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for those who disbelieved before them they were mightier than these in power and in the traces which they left behind them in the earth yet allah seized them for their sins and they had no protector from allah that was because their messengers kept bringing them clear proofs of allah sovereignty but they disbelieved so allah seized them lo he is strong severe in punishment and verily we sent moses with our revelations and clear warrant unto pharaoh and haman and korah but they said lying sorcerer and when he brought them the truth from our presence they said slay the sons of those who believe with him and spare their women but the plot of disbelievers is in naught but error and pharaoh said suffer me to kill moses and let him cry unto his lord lo fear that he will alter your religion or that he will cause confusion in the land moses said lo seek refuge in my lord and your lord from every scorner who believeth not in day of reckoning and believing man of pharaoh family who hid his faith said would ye kill man because he saith my lord is allah and hath brought you clear proofs from your lord if he is lying then his lie is upon him and if he is truthful then some of that wherewith he threateneth you will strike you lo allah guideth not one who is prodigal liar my people yours is the kingdom to day ye being uppermost in the land but who would save us from the wrath of allah should it reach us pharaoh said do but show you what think and do but guide you to wise policy and he who believed said my people lo fear for you fate like that of the factions of old plight like that of noah folk and ad and thamud and those after them and allah willeth no injustice for his slaves and my people lo fear for you day of summoning day when ye will turn to flee having no preserver from allah and he whom allah sendeth astray for him there is no guide and verily joseph brought you of old clear proofs yet ye ceased not to be in doubt concerning what he brought you till when he died ye said allah will not send any messenger after him thus allah deceiveth him who is prodigal doubter those who wrangle concerning the revelations of allah without any warrant that hath come unto them it is greatly hateful in the sight of allah and in the sight of those who believe thus doth allah print on every arrogant disdainful heart and pharaoh said haman build for me tower that haply may reach the roads the roads of the heavens and may look upon the god of moses though verily think him liar thus was the evil that he did made fairseeming unto pharaoh and he was debarred from the right way the plot of pharaoh ended but in ruin and he who believed said my people follow me will show you the way of right conduct my people lo this life of the world is but passing comfort and lo the hereafter that is the enduring home whoso doeth an ill deed he will be repaid the like thereof while whoso doeth right whether male or female and is believer all such will enter the garden where they will be nourished without stint and my people what aileth me that call you unto deliverance when ye call me unto the fire ye call me to disbelieve in allah and ascribe unto him as partners that whereof have no knowledge while call you unto the mighty the forgiver assuredly that whereunto ye call me hath no claim in the world or in the hereafter and our return will be unto allah and the prodigals will be owners of the fire and ye will remember what say unto you confide my cause unto allah lo allah is seer of his slaves so allah warded off from him the evils which they plotted while dreadful doom encompassed pharaoh folk the fire they are exposed to it morning and evening and on the day when the hour upriseth it is said cause pharaoh folk to enter the most awful doom and when they wrangle in the fire the weak say unto those who were proud lo we were following unto you will ye therefor rid us of portion of the fire those who were proud say lo we are all together herein lo allah hath judged between his slaves and those in the fire say unto the guards of hell entreat your lord that he relieve us of day of the torment they say came not your messengers unto you with clear proofs they say yea verily they say then do ye pray although the prayer of disbelievers is in vain lo we verily do help our messengers and those who believe in the life of the world and on the day when the witnesses arise the day when their excuse availeth not the evil doers and theirs is the curse and theirs the ill abode and we verily gave moses the guidance and we caused the children of israel to inherit the scripture guide and reminder for men of understanding then have patience muhammad lo the promise of allah is true and ask forgiveness of thy sin and hymn the praise of thy lord at fall of night and in the early hours lo those who wrangle concerning the revelations of allah without warrant having come unto them there is naught else in their breasts save pride which they will never attain so take thou refuge in allah lo he only he is the hearer the seer assuredly the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the creation of mankind but most of mankind know not and the blind man and the seer are not equal neither are those who believe and do good works equal with the evil doer little do ye reflect lo the hour is surely coming there is no doubt thereof yet most of mankind believe not and your lord hath said pray unto me and will hear your prayer lo those who scorn my service they will enter hell disgraced allah it is who hath appointed for you night that ye may rest therein and day for seeing lo allah is lord of bounty for mankind yet most of mankind give not thanks such is allah your lord the creator of all things there is no allah save him how then are ye perverted thus are they perverted who deny the revelations of allah allah it is who appointed for you the earth for dwelling place and the sky for canopy and fashioned you and perfected your shapes and hath provided you with good things such is allah your lord then blessed be allah the lord of the worlds he is the living one there is no allah save him so pray unto him making religion pure for him only praise be to allah the lord of the worlds say muhammad am forbidden to worship those unto whom ye cry beside allah since there have come unto me clear proofs from my lord and am commanded to surrender to the lord of the worlds he it is who created you from dust then from drop of seed then from clot then bringeth you forth as child then ordaineth that ye attain full strength and afterward that ye become old men though some among you die before and that ye reach an appointed term that haply ye may understand he it is who quickeneth and giveth death when he ordaineth thing he saith unto it only be and it is hast thou not seen those who wrangle concerning the revelations of allah how they are turned away those who deny the scripture and that wherewith we send our messengers but they will come to know when carcans are about their necks and chains they are dragged through boiling waters then they are thrust into the fire then it is said unto them where are all that ye used to make partners in the sovereignty beside allah they say they have failed us but we used not to pray to anything before thus doth allah send astray the disbelievers in his guidance and it is said unto them this is because ye exulted in the earth without right and because ye were petulant enter ye the gates of hell to dwell therein evil is the habitation of the scornful then have patience muhammad lo the promise of allah is true and whether we let thee see part of that which we promise them or whether we cause thee to die still unto us they will be brought back verily we sent messengers before thee among them those of whom we have told thee and some of whom we have not told thee and it was not given to any messenger that he should bring portent save by allah leave but when allah commandment cometh the cause is judged aright and the followers of vanity will then be lost allah it is who hath appointed for you cattle that ye may ride on some of them and eat of some many benefits ye have from them and that ye may satisfy by their means need that is in your breasts and may be borne upon them as upon the ship and he showeth you his tokens which then of the tokens of allah do ye deny have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for those before them they were more numerous than these and mightier in power and in the traces which they left behind them in the earth but all that they used to earn availed them not and when their messengers brought them clear proofs of allah sovereignty they exulted in the knowledge they themselves possessed and that which they were wont to mock befell them then when they saw our doom they said we believe in allah only and reject all that we used to associate with him but their faith could not avail them when they saw our doom this is allah law which hath ever taken course for his bondmen and then the disbelievers will be ruined sura fussilat explained in detail ha mim revelation from the beneficent the merciful scripture whereof the verses are expounded lecture in arabic for people who have knowledge good tidings and warning but most of them turn away so that they hear not and they say our hearts are protected from that unto which thou muhammad callest us and in our ears there is deafness and between us and thee there is veil act then lo we also shall be acting say unto them muhammad am only mortal like you it is inspired in me that your allah is one allah therefor take the straight path unto him and seek forgiveness of him and woe unto the idolaters who give not the poor due and who are disbelievers in the hereafter lo as for those who believe and do good works for them is reward enduring say muhammad unto the idolaters disbelieve ye verily in him who created the earth in two days and ascribe ye unto him rivals he and none else is the lord of the worlds he placed therein firm hills rising above it and blessed it and measured therein its sustenance in four days alike for all who ask then turned he to the heaven when it was smoke and said unto it and unto the earth come both of you willingly or loth they said we come obedient then he ordained them seven heavens in two days and inspired in each heaven its mandate and we decked the nether heaven with lamps and rendered it inviolable that is the measuring of the mighty the knower but if they turn away then say warn you of thunderbolt like the thunderbolt which fell of old upon the tribes of ad and thamud when their messengers came unto them from before them and behind them saying worship none but allah they said if our lord had willed he surely would have sent down angels unto us so lo we are disbelievers in that wherewith ye have been sent as for ad they were arrogant in the land without right and they said who is mightier than us in power could they not see that allah who created them he was mightier than them in power and they denied our revelations therefor we let loose on them raging wind in evil days that we might make them taste the torment of disgrace in the life of the world and verily the doom of the hereafter will be more shameful and they will not be helped and as for thamud we gave them guidance but they preferred blindness to the guidance so the bolt of the doom of humiliation overtook them because of what they used to earn and we delivered those who believed and used to keep their duty to allah and make mention of the day when the enemies of allah are gathered unto the fire they are driven on till when they reach it their ears and their eyes and their skins testify against them as to what they used to do and they say unto their skins why testify ye against us they say allah hath given us speech who giveth speech to all things and who created you at the first and unto whom ye are returned ye did not hide yourselves lest your ears and your eyes and your skins should testify against you but ye deemed that allah knew not much of what ye did that your thought which ye did think about your lord hath ruined you and ye find yourselves this day among the lost and though they are resigned yet the fire is still their home and if they ask for favour yet they are not of those unto whom favour can be shown and we assigned them comrades in the world who made their present and their past fairseeming unto them and the word concerning nations of the jinn and humankind who passed away before them hath effect for them lo they were ever losers those who disbelieve say heed not this qur an and drown the hearing of it haply ye may conquer but verily we shall cause those who disbelieve to taste an awful doom and verily we shall requite them the worst of what they used to do that is the reward of allah enemies the fire therein is their immortal home payment forasmuch as they denied our revelations and those who disbelieve will say our lord show us those who beguiled us of the jinn and humankind we will place them underneath our feet that they may be among the nethermost lo those who say our lord is allah and afterward are upright the angels descend upon them saying fear not nor grieve but hear good tidings of the paradise which ye are promised we are your protecting friends in the life of the world and in the hereafter there ye will have all that your souls desire and there ye will have all for which ye pray gift of welcome from one forgiving merciful and who is better in speech than him who prayeth unto his lord and doeth right and saith lo am of those who are muslims surrender unto him the good deed and the evil deed are not alike repel the evil deed with one which is better then lo he between whom and thee there was enmity will become as though he was bosom friend but none is granted it save those who are steadfast and none is granted it save the owner of great happiness and if whisper from the devil reach thee muhammad then seek refuge in allah lo he is the hearer the knower and of his portents are the night and the day and the sun and the moon do not prostrate to the sun or the moon but prostrate to allah who created them if it is in truth him whom ye worship but if they are too proud still those who are with thy lord glorify him night and day and tire not and of his portents is this that thou seest the earth lowly but when we send down water thereon it thrilleth and groweth lo he who quickeneth it is verily the quickener of the dead lo he is able to do all things lo those who distort our revelations are not hid from us is he who is hurled into the fire better or he who cometh secure on the day of resurrection do what ye will lo he is seer of what ye do lo those who disbelieve in the reminder when it cometh unto them are guilty for lo it is an unassailable scripture falsehood cannot come at it from before it or from behind it it is revelation from the wise the owner of praise naught is said unto thee muhammad save what was said unto the messengers before thee lo thy lord is owner of forgiveness and owner also of dire punishment and if we had appointed it lecture in foreign tongue they would assuredly have said if only its verses were expounded so that we might understand what foreign tongue and an arab say unto them muhammad for those who believe it is guidance and healing and as for those who disbelieve there is deafness in their ears and it is blindness for them such are called to from afar and we verily gave moses the scripture but there hath been dispute concerning it and but for word that had already gone forth from thy lord it would ere now have been judged between them but lo they are in hopeless doubt concerning it whoso doeth right it is for his soul and whoso doeth wrong it is against it and thy lord is not at all tyrant to his slaves unto him is referred all knowledge of the hour and no fruits burst forth from their sheaths and no female carrieth or bringeth forth but with his knowledge and on the day when he calleth unto them where are now my partners they will say we confess unto thee not one of us is witness for them and those to whom they used to cry of old have failed them and they perceive they have no place of refuge man tireth not of praying for good and if ill toucheth him then he is disheartened desperate and verily if we cause him to taste mercy after some hurt that hath touched him he will say this is my own and deem not that the hour will ever rise and if am brought back to my lord surely shall be better off with him but we verily shall tell those who disbelieve all that they did and we verily shall make them taste hard punishment when we show favour unto man he withdraweth and turneth aside but when ill toucheth him then he aboundeth in prayer bethink you if it is from allah and ye reject it who is further astray than one who is at open feud with allah we shall show them our portents on the horizons and within themselves until it will be manifest unto them that it is the truth doth not thy lord suffice since he is witness over all things how are they still in doubt about the meeting with their lord lo is not he surrounding all things sura ash shura council consultation ha mim in sin qaf thus allah the mighty the knower inspireth thee muhammad as he inspired those before thee unto him belongeth all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth and he is the sublime the tremendous almost might the heavens above be rent asunder while the angels hymn the praise of their lord and ask forgiveness for those on the earth lo allah he is the forgiver the merciful and as for those who choose protecting friends beside him allah is warden over them and thou art in no wise guardian over them and thus we have inspired in thee lecture in arabic that thou mayst warn the mother town and those around it and mayst warn of day of assembling whereof there is no doubt host will be in the garden and host of them in the flame had allah willed he could have made them one community but allah bringeth whom he will into his mercy and the wrong doers have no friend nor helper or have they chosen protecting friends besides him but allah he alone is the protecting friend he quickeneth the dead and he is able to do all things and in whatsoever ye differ the verdict therein belongeth to allah such is my lord in whom put my trust and unto whom turn the creator of the heavens and the earth he hath made for you pairs of yourselves and of the cattle also pairs whereby he multiplieth you naught is as his likeness and he is the hearer the seer his are the keys of the heavens and the earth he enlargeth providence for whom he will and straiteneth it for whom he will lo he is knower of all things he hath ordained for you that religion which he commended unto noah and that which we inspire in thee muhammad and that which we commended unto abraham and moses and jesus saying establish the religion and be not divided therein dreadful for the idolaters is that unto which thou callest them allah chooseth for himself whom he will and guideth unto himself him who turneth toward him and they were not divided until after the knowledge came unto them through rivalry among themselves and had it not been for word that had already gone forth from thy lord for an appointed term it surely had been judged between them and those who were made to inherit the scripture after them are verily in hopeless doubt concerning it unto this then summon muhammad and be thou upright as thou art commanded and follow not their lusts but say believe in whatever scripture allah hath sent down and am commanded to be just among you allah is our lord and your lord unto us our works and unto you your works no argument between us and you allah will bring us together and unto him is the journeying and those who argue concerning allah after he hath been acknowledged their argument hath no weight with their lord and wrath is upon them and theirs will be an awful doom allah it is who hath revealed the scripture with truth and the balance how canst thou know it may be that the hour is nigh those who believe not therein seek to hasten it while those who believe are fearful of it and know that it is the truth are not they who dispute in doubt concerning the hour far astray allah is gracious unto his slaves he provideth for whom he will and he is the strong the mighty whoso desireth the harvest of the hereafter we give him increase in its harvest and whoso desireth the harvest of the world we give him thereof and he hath no portion in the hereafter or have they partners of allah who have made lawful for them in religion that which allah allowed not and but for decisive word gone forth already it would have been judged between them lo for wrong doers is painful doom thou seest the wrong doers fearful of that which they have earned and it will surely befall them while those who believe and do good works will be in flowering meadows of the gardens having what they wish from their lord this is the great preferment this it is which allah announceth unto his bondmen who believe and do good works say muhammad unto mankind ask of you no fee therefor save lovingkindness among kinsfolk and whoso scoreth good deed we add unto its good for him lo allah is forgiving responsive or say they he hath invented lie concerning allah if allah willed he could have sealed thy heart against them and allah will wipe out the lie and will vindicate the truth by his words lo he is aware of what is hidden in the breasts of men and he it is who accepteth repentance from his bondmen and pardoneth the evil deeds and knoweth what ye do and accepteth those who do good works and giveth increase unto them of his bounty and as for disbelievers theirs will be an awful doom and if allah were to enlarge the provision for his slaves they would surely rebel in the earth but he sendeth down by measure as he willeth lo he is informed seer of his bondmen and he it is who sendeth down the saving rain after they have despaired and spreadeth out his mercy he is the protecting friend the praiseworthy and of his portents is the creation of the heaven and the earth and of whatever beasts he hath dispersed therein and he is able to gather them when he will whatever of misfortune striketh you it is what your right hands have earned and he forgiveth much ye cannot escape in the earth for beside allah ye have no protecting friend nor any helper and of his portents are the ships like banners on the sea if he will he calmeth the wind so that they keep still upon its surface lo herein verily are signs for every steadfast grateful heart or he causeth them to perish on account of that which they have earned and he forgiveth much and that those who argue concerning our revelations may know they have no refuge now whatever ye have been given is but passing comfort for the life of the world and that which allah hath is better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their lord and those who shun the worst of sins and indecencies and when they are wroth forgive and those who answer the call of their lord and establish worship and whose affairs are matter of counsel and who spend of what we have bestowed on them and those who when great wrong is done to them defend themselves the guerdon of an ill deed is an ill the like thereof but whosoever pardoneth and amendeth his wage is the affair of allah lo he loveth not wrong doers and whoso defendeth himself after he hath suffered wrong for such there is no way of blame against them the way of blame is only against those who oppress mankind and wrongfully rebel in the earth for such there is painful doom and verily whoso is patient and forgiveth lo that verily is of the steadfast heart of things he whom allah sendeth astray for him there is no protecting friend after him and thou muhammad wilt see the evil doers when they see the doom how they say is there any way of return and thou wilt see them exposed to the fire made humble by disgrace and looking with veiled eyes and those who believe will say lo the eternal losers are they who lose themselves and their housefolk on the day of resurrection lo are not the wrong doers in perpetual torment and they will have no protecting friends to help them instead of allah he whom allah sendeth astray for him there is no road answer the call of your lord before there cometh unto you from allah day which there is no averting ye have no refuge on that day nor have ye any power of refusal but if they are averse we have not sent thee as warder over them thine is only to convey the message and lo when we cause man to taste of mercy from us he exulteth therefor and if some evil striketh them because of that which their own hands have sent before then lo man is an ingrate unto allah belongeth the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth he createth what he will he bestoweth female offspring upon whom he will and bestoweth male offspring upon whom he will or he mingleth them males and females and he maketh barren whom he will lo he is knower powerful and it was not vouchsafed to any mortal that allah should speak to him unless it be by revelation or from behind veil or that he sendeth messenger to reveal what he will by his leave lo he is exalted wise and thus have we inspired in thee muhammad spirit of our command thou knewest not what the scripture was nor what the faith but we have made it light whereby we guide whom we will of our bondmen and lo thou verily dost guide unto right path the path of allah unto whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth do not all things reach allah at last sura az zukhruf ornaments of gold luxury ha mim by the scripture which maketh plain lo we have appointed it lecture in arabic that haply ye may understand and lo in the source of decrees which we possess it is indeed sublime decisive shall we utterly ignore you because ye are wanton folk how many prophet did we send among the men of old and never came there unto them prophet but they used to mock him then we destroyed men mightier than these in prowess and the example of the men of old hath gone before them and if thou muhammad ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will surely answer the mighty the knower created them who made the earth resting place for you and placed roads for you therein that haply ye may find your way and who sendeth down water from the sky in due measure and we revive dead land therewith even so will ye be brought forth he who created all the pairs and appointed for you ships and cattle whereupon ye ride that ye may mount upon their backs and may remember your lord favour when ye mount thereon and may say glorified be he who hath subdued these unto us and we were not capable of subduing them and lo unto our lord we surely are returning and they allot to him portion of his bondmen lo man is verily mere ingrate or chooseth he daughters of all that he hath created and honoureth he you with sons and if one of them hath tidings of that which he likeneth to the beneficent one his countenance becometh black and he is full of inward rage liken they then to allah that which is bred up in outward show and in dispute cannot make itself plain and they make the angels who are the slaves of the beneficent females did they witness their creation their testimony will be recorded and they will be questioned and they say if the beneficent one had so willed we should not have worshipped them they have no knowledge whatsoever of that they do but guess or have we given them any scripture before this qur an so that they are holding fast thereto nay for they say only lo we found our fathers following religion and we are guided by their footprints and even so we sent not warner before thee muhammad into any township but its luxurious ones said lo we found our fathers following religion and we are following their footprints and the warner said what even though bring you better guidance than that ye found your fathers following they answered lo in what ye bring we are disbelievers so we requited them then see the nature of the consequence for the rejecters and when abraham said unto his father and his folk lo am innocent of what ye worship save him who did create me for he will surely guide me and he made it word enduring among his seed that haply they might return nay but let these and their fathers enjoy life only till there should come unto them the truth and messenger making plain and now that the truth hath come unto them they say this is mere magic and lo we are disbelievers therein and they say if only this qur an had been revealed to some great man of the two towns is it they who apportion thy lord mercy we have apportioned among them their livelihood in the life of the world and raised some of them above others in rank that some of them may take labour from others and the mercy of thy lord is better than the wealth that they amass and were it not that mankind would have become one community we might well have appointed for those who disbelieve in the beneficent roofs of silver for their houses and stairs of silver whereby to mount and for their houses doors of silver and couches of silver whereon to recline and ornaments of gold yet all that would have been but provision of the life of the world and the hereafter with your lord would have been for those who keep from evil and he whose sight is dim to the remembrance of the beneficent we assign unto him devil who becometh his comrade and lo they surely turn them from the way of allah and yet they deem that they are rightly guided till when he cometh unto us he saith unto his comrade ah would that between me and thee there were the distance of the two horizons an evil comrade and it profiteth you not this day because ye did wrong that ye will be sharers in the doom canst thou muhammad make the deaf to hear or canst thou guide the blind or him who is in error manifest and if we take thee away we surely shall take vengeance on them or if we show thee that wherewith we threaten them for lo we have complete command of them so hold thou fast to that which is inspired in thee lo thou art on right path and lo it is in truth reminder for thee and for thy folk and ye will be questioned and ask those of our messengers whom we sent before thee did we ever appoint gods to be worshipped beside the beneficent and verily we sent moses with our revelations unto pharaoh and his chiefs and he said am messenger of the lord of the worlds but when he brought them our tokens behold they laughed at them and every token that we showed them was greater than its sister token and we grasped them with the torment that haply they might turn again and they said wizard entreat thy lord for us by the pact that he hath made with thee lo we verily will walk aright but when we eased them of the torment behold they broke their word and pharaoh caused proclamation to be made among his people saying my people is not mine the sovereignty of egypt and these rivers flowing under me can ye not then discern am surely better than this fellow who is despicable and can hardly make his meaning plain why then have armlets of gold not been set upon him or angels sent along with him thus he persuaded his people to make light of moses and they obeyed him lo they were wanton folk so when they angered us we punished them and drowned them every one and we made them thing past and an example for those after them and when the son of mary is quoted as an example behold the folk laugh out and say are our gods better or is he they raise not the objection save for argument nay but they are contentious folk he is nothing but slave on whom we bestowed favour and we made him pattern for the children of israel and had we willed we could have set among you angels to be viceroys in the earth and lo verily there is knowledge of the hour so doubt ye not concerning it but follow me this is the right path and let not satan turn you aside lo he is an open enemy for you when jesus came with clear proofs of allah sovereignty he said have come unto you with wisdom and to make plain some of that concerning which ye differ so keep your duty to allah and obey me lo allah he is my lord and your lord so worship him this is right path but the factions among them differed then woe unto those who do wrong from the doom of painful day await they aught save the hour that it shall come upon them suddenly when they know not friends on that day will be foes one to another save those who kept their duty to allah my slaves for you there is no fear this day nor is it ye who grieve ye who believed our revelations and were self surrendered enter the garden ye and your wives to be made glad therein are brought round for them trays of gold and goblets and therein is all that souls desire and eyes find sweet and ye are immortal therein this is the garden which ye are made to inherit because of what ye used to do therein for you is fruit in plenty whence to eat lo the guilty are immortal in hell torment it is not relaxed for them and they despair therein we wronged them not but they it was who did the wrong and they cry master let thy lord make an end of us he saith lo here ye must remain we verily brought the truth unto you but ye were most of you averse to the truth or do they determine any thing against the prophet lo we also are determining or deem they that we cannot hear their secret thoughts and private confidences nay but our envoys present with them do record say muhammad if the beneficent one hath son then shall be first among the worshippers but there is no son glorified be the lord of the heavens and the earth the lord of the throne from that which they ascribe unto him so let them flounder in their talk and play until they meet the day which they are promised and he it is who in the heaven is allah and in the earth allah he is the wise the knower and blessed be he unto whom belongeth the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them and with whom is knowledge of the hour and unto whom ye will be returned and those unto whom they cry instead of him possess no power of intercession saving him who beareth witness unto the truth knowingly and if thou ask them who created them they will surely say allah how then are they turned away and he saith my lord lo these are folk who believe not then bear with them muhammad and say peace but they will come to know sura ad dukhan smoke ha mim by the scripture that maketh plain lo we revealed it on blessed night lo we are ever warning whereon every wise command is made clear as command from our presence lo we are ever sending mercy from thy lord lo he even he is the hearer the knower lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them if ye would be sure there is no allah save him he quickeneth and giveth death your lord and lord of your forefathers nay but they play in doubt but watch thou muhammad for the day when the sky will produce visible smoke that will envelop the people this will be painful torment then they will say our lord relieve us of the torment lo we are believers how can there be remembrance for them when messenger making plain the truth had already come unto them and they had turned away from him and said one taught by others madman lo we withdraw the torment little lo ye return to disbelief on the day when we shall seize them with the greater seizure then in truth we shall punish and verily we tried before them pharaoh folk when there came unto them noble messenger saying give up to me the slaves of allah lo am faithful messenger unto you and saying be not proud against allah lo bring you clear warrant and lo have sought refuge in my lord and your lord lest ye stone me to death and if ye put no faith in me then let me go and he cried unto his lord saying these are guilty folk then his lord commanded take away my slaves by night lo ye will be followed and leave the sea behind at rest for lo they are drowned host how many were the gardens and the watersprings that they left behind and the cornlands and the goodly sites and pleasant things wherein they took delight even so it was and we made it an inheritance for other folk and the heaven and the earth wept not for them nor were they reprieved and we delivered the children of israel from the shameful doom we delivered them from pharaoh lo he was tyrant of the wanton ones and we chose them purposely above all creatures and we gave them portents wherein was clear trial lo these forsooth are saying there is naught but our first death and we shall not be raised again bring back our fathers if ye speak the truth are they better or the folk of tubb and those before them we destroyed them for surely they were guilty and we created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in play we created them not save with truth but most of them know not assuredly the day of decision is the term for all of them day when friend can in naught avail friend nor can they be helped save him on whom allah hath mercy lo he is the mighty the merciful lo the tree of zaqqum the food of the sinner like molten brass it seetheth in their bellies as the seething of boiling water and it will be said take him and drag him to the midst of hell then pour upon his head the torment of boiling water saying taste lo thou wast forsooth the mighty the noble lo this is that whereof ye used to doubt lo those who kept their duty will be in place secured amid gardens and watersprings attired in silk and silk embroidery facing one another even so it will be and we shall wed them unto fair ones with wide lovely eyes they call therein for every fruit in safety they taste not death therein save the first death and he hath saved them from the doom of hell bounty from thy lord that is the supreme triumph and we have made this scripture easy in thy language only that they may heed wait then muhammad lo they too are waiting sura al jathiya crouching ha mim the revelation of the scripture is from allah the mighty the wise lo in the heavens and the earth are portents for believers and in your creation and all the beasts that he scattereth in the earth are portents for folk whose faith is sure and the difference of night and day and the provision that allah sendeth down from the sky and thereby quickeneth the earth after her death and the ordering of the winds are portents for people who have sense these are the portents of allah which we recite unto thee muhammad with truth then in what fact after allah and his portents will they believe woe unto each sinful liar who heareth the revelations of allah recited unto him and then continueth in pride as though he heard them not give him tidings of painful doom and when he knoweth aught of our revelations he maketh it jest for such there is shameful doom beyond them there is hell and that which they have earned will naught avail them nor those whom they have chosen for protecting friends beside allah theirs will be an awful doom this is guidance and those who disbelieve the revelations of their lord for them there is painful doom of wrath allah it is who hath made the sea of service unto you that the ships may run thereon by his command and that ye may seek of his bounty and that haply ye may be thankful and hath made of service unto you whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth it is all from him lo herein verily are portents for people who reflect tell those who believe to forgive those who hope not for the days of allah in order that he may requite folk what they used to earn whoso doeth right it is for his soul and whoso doeth wrong it is against it and afterward unto your lord ye will be brought back and verily we gave the children of israel the scripture and the command and the prophethood and provided them with good things and favoured them above all peoples and gave them plain commandments and they differed not until after the knowledge came unto them through rivalry among themselves lo thy lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ and now have we set thee muhammad on clear road of our commandment so follow it and follow not the whims of those who know not lo they can avail thee naught against allah and lo as for the wrongdoers some of them are friends of others and allah is the friend of those who ward off evil this is clear indication for mankind and guidance and mercy for folk whose faith is sure or do those who commit ill deeds suppose that we shall make them as those who believe and do good works the same in life and death bad is their judgment and allah hath created the heavens and the earth with truth and that every soul may be repaid what it hath earned and they will not be wronged hast thou seen him who maketh his desire his god and allah sendeth him astray purposely and sealeth up his hearing and his heart and setteth on his sight covering then who will lead him after allah hath condemned him will ye not then heed and they say there is naught but our life of the world we die and we live and naught destroyeth us save time when they have no knowledge whatsoever of all that they do but guess and when our clear revelations are recited unto them their only argument is that they say bring back our fathers then if ye are truthful say unto them muhammad allah giveth life to you then causeth you to die then gathereth you unto the day of resurrection whereof there is no doubt but most of mankind know not and unto allah belongeth the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and on the day when the hour riseth on that day those who follow falsehood will be lost and thou wilt see each nation crouching each nation summoned to its record and it will be said unto them this day ye are requited what ye used to do this our book pronounceth against you with truth lo we have caused all that ye did to be recorded then as for those who believed and did good works their lord will bring them in unto his mercy that is the evident triumph and as for those who disbelieved it will be said unto them were not our revelations recited unto you but ye were scornful and became guilty folk and when it was said lo allah promise is the truth and there is no doubt of the hour coming ye said we know not what the hour is we deem it naught but conjecture and we are by no means convinced and the evils of what they did will appear unto them and that which they used to deride will befall them and it will be said this day we forget you even as ye forgot the meeting of this your day and your habitation is the fire and there is none to help you this forasmuch as ye made the revelations of allah jest and the life of the world beguiled you therefor this day they come not forth from thence nor can they make amends then praise be to allah lord of the heavens and lord of the earth the lord of the worlds and unto him alone belongeth majesty in the heavens and the earth and he is the mighty the wise sura al ahqaf the wind curved sandhills the dunes ha mim the revelation of the scripture is from allah the mighty the wise we created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them save with truth and for term appointed but those who disbelieve turn away from that whereof they are warned say unto them muhammad have ye thought on all that ye invoke beside allah show me what they have created of the earth or have they any portion in the heavens bring me scripture before this scripture or some vestige of knowledge in support of what ye say if ye are truthful and who is further astray than those who instead of allah pray unto such as hear not their prayer until the day of resurrection and are unconscious of their prayer and when mankind are gathered to the judgment will become enemies for them and will become deniers of having been worshipped and when our clear revelations are recited unto them those who disbelieve say of the truth when it reacheth them this is mere magic or say they he hath invented it say muhammad if have invented it still ye have no power to support me against allah he is best aware of what ye say among yourselves concerning it he sufficeth for witness between me and you and he is the forgiving the merciful say am no new thing among the messengers of allah nor know what will be done with me or with you do but follow that which is inspired in me and am but plain warner bethink you if it is from allah and ye disbelieve therein and witness of the children of israel hath already testified to the like thereof and hath believed and ye are too proud what plight is yours lo allah guideth not wrong doing folk and those who disbelieve say of those who believe if it had been any good they would not have been before us in attaining it and since they will not be guided by it they say this is an ancient lie when before it there was the scripture of moses an example and mercy and this is confirming scripture in the arabic language that it may warn those who do wrong and bring good tidings for the righteous lo those who say our lord is allah and thereafter walk aright there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve such are rightful owners of the garden immortal therein as reward for what they used to do and we have commended unto man kindness toward parents his mother beareth him with reluctance and bringeth him forth with reluctance and the bearing of him and the weaning of him is thirty months till when he attaineth full strength and reacheth forty years he saith my lord arouse me that may give thanks for the favour wherewith thou hast favoured me and my parents and that may do right acceptable unto thee and be gracious unto me in the matter of my seed lo have turned unto thee repentant and lo am of those who surrender unto thee those are they from whom we accept the best of what they do and overlook their evil deeds they are among the owners of the garden this is the true promise which they were promised in the world and whoso saith unto his parents fie upon you both do ye threaten me that shall be brought forth again when generations before me have passed away and they twain cry unto allah for help and say woe unto thee believe lo the promise of allah is true but he saith this is naught save fables of the men of old such are those on whom the word concerning nations of the jinn and mankind which have passed away before them hath effect lo they are the losers and for all there will be ranks from what they do that he may pay them for their deeds and they will not be wronged and on the day when those who disbelieve are exposed to the fire it will be said ye squandered your good things in the life of the world and sought comfort therein now this day ye are rewarded with the doom of ignominy because ye were disdainful in the land without right and because ye used to transgress and make mention muhammad of the brother of ad when he warned his folk among the wind curved sandhills and verily warners came and went before and after him saying serve none but allah lo fear for you the doom of tremendous day they said hast come to turn us away from our gods then bring upon us that wherewith thou threatenest us if thou art of the truthful he said the knowledge is with allah only convey unto you that wherewith have been sent but see you are folk that know not then when they beheld it as dense cloud coming toward their valleys they said here is cloud bringing us rain nay but it is that which ye did seek to hasten wind wherein is painful torment destroying all things by commandment of its lord and morning found them so that naught could be seen save their dwellings thus do we reward the guilty folk and verily we had empowered them with that wherewith we have not empowered you and had assigned them ears and eyes and hearts but their ears and eyes and hearts availed them naught since they denied the revelations of allah and what they used to mock befell them and verily we have destroyed townships round about you and displayed for them our revelation that haply they might return then why did those whom they had chosen for gods as way of approach unto allah not help them nay but they did fail them utterly and all that was their lie and what they used to invent and when we inclined toward thee muhammad certain of the jinn who wished to hear the qur an and when they were in its presence said give ear and when it was finished turned back to their people warning they said our people lo we have heard scripture which hath been revealed after moses confirming that which was before it guiding unto the truth and right road our people respond to allah summoner and believe in him he will forgive you some of your sins and guard you from painful doom and whoso respondeth not to allah summoner he can nowise escape in the earth and he hath no protecting friends instead of him such are in error manifest have they not seen that allah who created the heavens and the earth and was not wearied by their creation is able to give life to the dead aye he verily is able to do all things and on the day when those who disbelieve are exposed to the fire they will be asked is not this real they will say yea by our lord he will say then taste the doom for that ye disbelieved then have patience muhammad even as the stout of heart among the messengers of old had patience and seek not to hasten on the doom for them on the day when they see that which they are promised it will seem to them as though they had tarried but an hour of daylight clear message shall any be destroyed save evil living folk sura muhammad muhammad those who disbelieve and turn men from the way of allah he rendereth their actions vain and those who believe and do good works and believe in that which is revealed unto muhammad and it is the truth from their lord he riddeth them of their ill deeds and improveth their state that is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood and because those who believe follow the truth from their lord thus allah coineth their similitudes for mankind now when ye meet in battle those who disbelieve then it is smiting of the necks until when ye have routed them then making fast of bonds and afterward either grace or ransom till the war lay down its burdens that is the ordinance and if allah willed he could have punished them without you but thus it is ordained that he may try some of you by means of others and those who are slain in the way of allah he rendereth not their actions vain he will guide them and improve their state and bring them in unto the garden which he hath made known to them ye who believe if ye help allah he will help you and will make your foothold firm and those who disbelieve perdition is for them and he will make their actions vain that is because they are averse to that which allah hath revealed therefor maketh he their actions fruitless have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for those who were before them allah wiped them out and for the disbelievers there will be the like thereof that is because allah is patron of those who believe and because the disbelievers have no patron lo allah will cause those who believe and do good works to enter gardens underneath which rivers flow while those who disbelieve take their comfort in this life and eat even as the cattle eat and the fire is their habitation and how many township stronger than thy township muhammad which hath cast thee out have we destroyed and they had no helper is he who relieth on clear proof from his lord like those for whom the evil that they do is beautified while they follow their own lusts similitude of the garden which those who keep their duty to allah are promised therein are rivers of water unpolluted and rivers of milk whereof the flavour changeth not and rivers of wine delicious to the drinkers and rivers of clear run honey therein for them is every kind of fruit with pardon from their lord are those who enjoy all this like those who are immortal in the fire and are given boiling water to drink so that it teareth their bowels among them are some who give ear unto thee muhammad till when they go forth from thy presence they say unto those who have been given knowledge what was that he said just now those are they whose hearts allah hath sealed and they follow their own lusts while as for those who walk aright he addeth to their guidance and giveth them their protection against evil await they aught save the hour that it should come upon them unawares and the beginnings thereof have already come but how when it hath come upon them can they take their warning so know muhammad that there is no allah save allah and ask forgiveness for thy sin and for believing men and believing women allah knoweth both your place of turmoil and your place of rest and those who believe say if only surah were revealed but when decisive surah is revealed and war is mentioned therein thou seest those in whose hearts is disease looking at thee with the look of men fainting unto death therefor woe unto them obedience and civil word then when the matter is determined if they are loyal to allah it will be well for them would ye then if ye were given the command work corruption in the land and sever your ties of kinship such are they whom allah curseth so that he deafeneth them and maketh blind their eyes will they then not meditate on the qur an or are there locks on the hearts lo those who turn back after the guidance hath been manifested unto them satan hath seduced them and he giveth them the rein that is because they say unto those who hate what allah hath revealed we will obey you in some matters and allah knoweth their secret talk then how will it be with them when the angels gather them smiting their faces and their backs that will be because they followed that which angereth allah and hated that which pleaseth him therefor he hath made their actions vain or do those in whose hearts is disease deem that allah will not bring to light their secret hates and if we would we could show them unto thee muhammad so that thou shouldst know them surely by their marks and thou shalt know them by the burden of their talk and allah knoweth your deeds and verily we shall try you till we know those of you who strive hard for the cause of allah and the steadfast and till we test your record lo those who disbelieve and turn from the way of allah and oppose the messenger after the guidance hath been manifested unto them they hurt allah not jot and he will make their actions fruitless ye who believe obey allah and obey the messenger and render not your actions vain lo those who disbelieve and turn from the way of allah and then die disbelievers allah surely will not pardon them so do not falter and cry out for peace when ye will be the uppermost and allah is with you and he will not grudge the reward of your actions the life of the world is but sport and pastime and if ye believe and ward off evil he will give you your wages and will not ask of you your wordly wealth if he should ask it of you and importune you ye would hoard it and he would bring to light your secret hates lo ye are those who are called to spend in the way of allah yet among you there are some who hoard and as for him who hoardeth he hoardeth only from his soul and allah is the rich and ye are the poor and if ye turn away he will exchange you for some other folk and they will not be the likes of you sura al fath victory conquest lo we have given thee muhammad signal victory that allah may forgive thee of thy sin that which is past and that which is to come and may perfect his favour unto thee and may guide thee on right path and that allah may help thee with strong help he it is who sent down peace of reassurance into the hearts of the believers that they might add faith unto their faith allah are the hosts of the heavens and the earth and allah is ever knower wise that he may bring the believing men and the believing women into gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide and may remit from them their evil deeds that in the sight of allah is the supreme triumph and may punish the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women and the idolatrous men and the idolatrous women who think an evil thought concerning allah for them is the evil turn of fortune and allah is wroth against them and hath cursed them and hath made ready for them hell hapless journey end allah are the hosts of the heavens and the earth and allah is ever mighty wise lo we have sent thee muhammad as witness and bearer of good tidings and warner that ye mankind may believe in allah and his messenger and may honour him and may revere him and may glorify him at early dawn and at the close of day lo those who swear allegiance unto thee muhammad swear allegiance only unto allah the hand of allah is above their hands so whosoever breaketh his oath breaketh it only to his soul hurt while whosoever keepeth his covenant with allah on him will he bestow immense reward those of the wandering arabs who were left behind will tell thee our possessions and our households occupied us so ask forgiveness for us they speak with their tongues that which is not in their hearts say who can avail you aught against allah if he intend you hurt or intend you profit nay but allah is ever aware of what ye do nay but ye deemed that the messenger and the believers would never return to their own folk and that was made fairseeming in your hearts and ye did think an evil thought and ye were worthless folk and so for him who believeth not in allah and his messenger lo we have prepared flame for disbelievers and allah is the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth he forgiveth whom he will and punisheth whom he will and allah is ever forgiving merciful those who were left behind will say when ye set forth to capture booty let us go with you they fain would change the verdict of allah say unto them muhammad ye shall not go with us thus hath allah said beforehand then they will say ye are envious of us nay but they understand not save little say unto those of the wandering arabs who were left behind ye will be called against folk of mighty prowess to fight them until they surrender and if ye obey allah will give you fair reward but if ye turn away as ye did turn away before he will punish you with painful doom there is no blame for the blind nor is there blame for the lame nor is there blame for the sick that they go not forth to war and whoso obeyeth allah and his messenger he will make him enter gardens underneath which rivers flow and whoso turneth back him will he punish with painful doom allah was well pleased with the believers when they swore allegiance unto thee beneath the tree and he knew what was in their hearts and he sent down peace of reassurance on them and hath rewarded them with near victory and much booty that they will capture allah is ever mighty wise allah promiseth you much booty that ye will capture and hath given you this in advance and hath withheld men hands from you that it may be token for the believers and that he may guide you on right path and other gain which ye have not been able to achieve allah will compass it allah is able to do all things and if those who disbelieve join battle with you they will take to flight and afterward they will find no protecting friend nor helper it is the law of allah which hath taken course aforetime thou wilt not find for the law of allah aught of power to change and he it is who hath withheld men hands from you and hath withheld your hands from them in the valley of mecca after he had made you victors over them allah is seer of what ye do these it was who disbelieved and debarred you from the inviolable place of worship and debarred the offering from reaching its goal and if it had not been for believing men and believing women whom ye know not lest ye should tread them under foot and thus incur guilt for them unknowingly that allah might bring into his mercy whom he will if the believers and the disbelievers had been clearly separated we verily had punished those of them who disbelieved with painful punishment when those who disbelieve had set up in their hearts zealotry the zealotry of the age of ignorance then allah sent down his peace of reassurance upon his messenger and upon the believers and imposed on them the word of self restraint for they were worthy of it and meet for it and allah is aware of all things allah hath fulfilled the vision for his messenger in very truth ye shall indeed enter the inviolable place of worship if allah will secure having your hair shaven and cut not fearing but he knoweth that which ye know not and hath given you near victory beforehand he it is who hath sent his messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth that he may cause it to prevail over all religion and allah sufficeth as witness muhammad is the messenger of allah and those with him are hard against the disbelievers and merciful among themselves thou muhammad seest them bowing and falling prostrate in worship seeking bounty from allah and his acceptance the mark of them is on their foreheads from the traces of prostration such is their likeness in the torah and their likeness in the gospel like as sown corn that sendeth forth its shoot and strengtheneth it and riseth firm upon its stalk delighting the sowers that he may enrage the disbelievers with the sight of them allah hath promised unto such of them as believe and do good works forgiveness and immense reward sura al hujraat the private apartments the inner apartments ye who believe be not forward in the presence of allah and his messenger and keep your duty to allah lo allah is hearer knower ye who believe lift not up your voices above the voice of the prophet nor shout when speaking to him as ye shout one to another lest your works be rendered vain while ye perceive not lo they who subdue their voices in the presence of the messenger of allah those are they whose hearts allah hath proven unto righteousness theirs will be forgiveness and immense reward lo those who call thee from behind the private apartments most of them have no sense and if they had had patience till thou camest forth unto them it had been better for them and allah is forgiving merciful ye who believe if an evil liver bring you tidings verify it lest ye smite some folk in ignorance and afterward repent of what ye did and know that the messenger of allah much of the government ye would surely the faith to you and hath beautified it and lewdness and rebellion hateful unto guided is among you if he were to obey you in be in trouble but allah hath endeared in your hearts and hath made disbelief you such are they who are the rightly it is bounty and grace from allah and allah is knower wise and if two parties of believers fall to fighting then make peace between them and if one party of them doeth wrong to the other fight ye that which doeth wrong till it return unto the ordinance of allah then if it return make peace between them justly and act equitably lo allah loveth the equitable the believers are naught else than brothers therefore make peace between your brethren and observe your duty to allah that haply ye may obtain mercy ye who believe let not folk deride folk who may be better than they are not let women deride women who may be better than they are neither defame one another nor insult one another by nicknames bad is the name of lewdness after faith and whoso turneth not in repentance such are evil doers ye who believe shun much suspicion for lo some suspicion is crime and spy not neither backbite one another would one of you love to eat the flesh of his dead brother ye abhor that so abhor the other and keep your duty to allah lo allah is relenting merciful mankind lo we have created you male and female and have made you nations and tribes that ye may know one another lo the noblest of you in the sight of allah is the best in conduct lo allah is knower aware the wandering arabs say we believe say unto them muhammad ye believe not but rather say we submit for the faith hath not yet entered into your hearts yet if ye obey allah and his messenger he will not withhold from you aught of the reward of your deeds lo allah is forgiving merciful the true believers are those only who believe in allah and his messenger and afterward doubt not but strive with their wealth and their lives for the cause of allah such are the sincere say unto them muhammad would ye teach allah your religion when allah knoweth all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth and allah is aware of all things they make it favour unto thee muhammad that they have surrendered unto him say deem not your surrender favour unto me but allah doth confer favour on you inasmuch as he hath led you to the faith if ye are earnest lo allah knoweth the unseen of the heavens and the earth and allah is seer of what ye do sura qaf the letter qaf qaf by the glorious qur an nay but they marvel that warner of their own hath come unto them and the disbelievers say this is strange thing when we are dead and have become dust shall we be brought back again that would be far return we know that which the earth taketh of them and with us is recording book nay but they have denied the truth when it came unto them therefor they are now in troubled case have they not then observed the sky above them how we have constructed it and beautified it and how there are no rifts therein and the earth have we spread out and have flung firm hills therein and have caused of every lovely kind to grow thereon vision and reminder for every penitent slave and we send down from the sky blessed water whereby we give growth unto gardens and the grain of crops and lofty date palms with ranged clusters provision made for men and therewith we quicken dead land even so will be the resurrection of the dead the folk of noah denied the truth before them and so did the dwellers at ar rass and the tribe of thamud and the tribe of ad and pharaoh and the brethren of lot and the dwellers in the wood and the folk of tubb every one denied their messengers therefor my threat took effect were we then worn out by the first creation yet they are in doubt about new creation we verily created man and we know what his soul whispereth to him and we are nearer to him than his jugular vein when the two receivers receive him seated on the right hand and on the left he uttereth no word but there is with him an observer ready and the agony of death cometh in truth and it is said unto him this is that which thou wast wont to shun and the trumpet is blown this is the threatened day and every soul cometh along with it driver and witness and unto the evil doer it is said thou wast in heedlessness of this now we have removed from thee thy covering and piercing is thy sight this day and unto the evil doer his comrade saith this is that which have ready as testimony and it is said do ye twain hurl to hell each rebel ingrate hinderer of good transgressor doubter who setteth up another god along with allah do ye twain hurl him to the dreadful doom his comrade saith our lord did not cause him to rebel but he was himself far gone in error he saith contend not in my presence when had already proffered unto you the warning the sentence that cometh from me cannot be changed and am in no wise tyrant unto the slaves on the day when we say unto hell art thou filled and it saith can there be more to come and the garden is brought nigh for those who kept from evil no longer distant and it is said this is that which ye were promised it is for every penitent and heedful one who feareth the beneficent in secret and cometh with contrite heart enter it in peace this is the day of immortality there they have all that they desire and there is more with us and how many generation we destroyed before them who were mightier than these in prowess so that they overran the lands had they any place of refuge when the judgment came lo therein verily is reminder for him who hath heart or giveth ear with full intelligence and verily we created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days and naught of weariness touched us therefor muhammad bear with what they say and hymn the praise of thy lord before the rising and before the setting of the sun and in the night time hymn his praise and after the prescribed prostrations and listen on the day when the crier crieth from near place the day when they will hear the awful cry in truth that is the day of coming forth from the graves lo we it is who quicken and give death and unto us is the journeying on the day when the earth splitteth asunder from them hastening forth they come that is gathering easy for us to make we are best aware of what they say and thou muhammad art in no wise compeller over them but warn by the qur an him who feareth my threat sura adh dhariyat the winnowing winds by those that winnow with winnowing and those that bear the burden of the rain and those that glide with ease upon the sea and those who distribute blessings by command lo that wherewith ye are threatened is indeed true and lo the judgment will indeed befall by the heaven full of paths lo ye forsooth are of various opinion concerning the truth he is made to turn away from it who is himself averse accursed be the conjecturers who are careless in an abyss they ask when is the day of judgment it is the day when they will be tormented at the fire and it will be said unto them taste your torment which ye inflicted this is what ye sought to hasten lo those who keep from evil will dwell amid gardens and watersprings taking that which their lord giveth them for lo aforetime they were doers of good they used to sleep but little of the night and ere the dawning of each day would seek forgiveness and in their wealth the beggar and the outcast had due share and in the earth are portents for those whose faith is sure and also in yourselves can ye then not see and in the heaven is your providence and that which ye are promised and by the lord of the heavens and the earth it is the truth even as it is true that ye speak hath the story of abraham honoured guests reached thee muhammad when they came in unto him and said peace he answered peace and thought folk unknown to me then he went apart unto his housefolk so that they brought fatted calf and he set it before them saying will ye not eat then he conceived fear of them they said fear not and gave him tidings of the birth of wise son then his wife came forward making moan and smote her face and cried barren old woman they said even so saith thy lord lo he is the wise the knower abraham said and afterward what is your errand ye sent from allah they said lo we are sent unto guilty folk that we may send upon them stones of clay marked by thy lord for the destruction of the wanton then we brought forth such believers as were there but we found there but one house of those surrendered to allah and we left behind therein portent for those who fear painful doom and in moses too there is portent when we sent him unto pharaoh with clear warrant but he withdrew confiding in his might and said wizard or madman so we seized him and his hosts and flung them in the sea for he was reprobate and in the tribe of ad there is portent when we sent the fatal wind against them it spared naught that it reached but made it all as dust and in the tribe of thamud there is portent when it was told them take your ease awhile but they rebelled against their lord decree and so the thunderbolt overtook them even while they gazed and they were unable to rise up nor could they help themselves and the folk of noah aforetime lo they were licentious folk we have built the heaven with might and we it is who make the vast extent thereof and the earth have we laid out how gracious is the spreader thereof and all things we have created by pairs that haply ye may reflect therefor flee unto allah lo am plain warner unto you from him and set not any other god along with allah lo am plain warner unto you from him even so there came no messenger unto those before them but they said wizard or madman have they handed down the saying as an heirloom one unto another nay but they are froward folk so withdraw from them muhammad for thou art in no wise blameworthy and warn for warning profiteth believers created the jinn and humankind only that they might worship me seek no livelihood from them nor do ask that they should feed me lo allah he it is that giveth livelihood the lord of unbreakable might and lo for those who now do wrong there is an evil day like unto the evil day which came for their likes of old so let them not ask me to hasten on that day and woe unto those who disbelieve from that their day which they are promised sura at tur the mount by the mount and scripture inscribed on fine parchment unrolled and the house frequented and the roof exalted and the sea kept filled lo the doom of thy lord will surely come to pass there is none that can ward it off on the day when the heaven will heave with awful heaving and the mountains move away with awful movement then woe that day unto the deniers who play in talk of grave matters the day when they are thrust with disdainful thrust into the fire of hell and it is said unto them this is the fire which ye were wont to deny is this magic or do ye not see endure the heat thereof and whether ye are patient of it or impatient of it is all one for you ye are only being paid for what ye used to do lo those who kept their duty dwell in gardens and delight happy because of what their lord hath given them and because their lord hath warded off from them the torment of hell fire and it is said unto them eat and drink in health as reward for what ye used to do reclining on ranged couches and we wed them unto fair ones with wide lovely eyes and they who believe and whose seed follow them in faith we cause their seed to join them there and we deprive them of nought of their life work every man is pledge for that which he hath earned and we provide them with fruit and meat such as they desire there they pass from hand to hand cup wherein is neither vanity nor cause of sin and there go round waiting on them menservants of their own as they were hidden pearls and some of them draw near unto others questioning saying lo of old when we were with our families we were ever anxious but allah hath been gracious unto us and hath preserved us from the torment of the breath of fire lo we used to pray unto him of old lo he is the benign the merciful therefor warn men muhammad by the grace of allah thou art neither soothsayer nor madman or say they he is poet one for whom we may expect the accident of time say unto them except your fill lo am with you among the expectant do their minds command them to do this or are they an outrageous folk or say they he hath invented it nay but they will not believe then let them produce speech the like thereof if they are truthful or were they created out of naught or are they the creators or did they create the heavens and the earth nay but they are sure of nothing or do they own the treasures of thy lord or have they been given charge thereof or have they any stairway unto heaven by means of which they overhear decrees then let their listener produce some warrant manifest or hath he daughters whereas ye have sons or askest thou muhammad fee from them so that they are plunged in debt or possess they the unseen so that they can write it down or seek they to ensnare the messenger but those who disbelieve they are the ensnared or have they any god beside allah glorified be allah from all that they ascribe as partner unto him and if they were to see fragment of the heaven falling they would say heap of clouds then let them be muhammad till they meet their day in which they will be thunder stricken day in which their guile will naught avail them nor will they be helped and verily for those who do wrong there is punishment beyond that but most of them know not so wait patiently muhammad for thy lord decree for surely thou art in our sight and hymn the praise of thy lord when thou uprisest and in the night time also hymn his praise and at the setting of the stars sura an najm the star by the star when it setteth your comrade erreth not nor is deceived nor doth he speak of his own desire it is naught save an inspiration that is inspired which one of mighty powers hath taught him one vigorous and he grew clear to view when he was on the uppermost horizon then he drew nigh and came down till he was distant two bows length or even nearer and he revealed unto his slave that which he revealed the heart lied not in seeing what it saw will ye then dispute with him concerning what he seeth and verily he saw him yet another time by the lote tree of the utmost boundary nigh unto which is the garden of abode when that which shroudeth did enshroud the lote tree the eye turned not aside nor yet was overbold verily he saw one of the greater revelations of his lord have ye thought upon al lat and al uzza and manat the third the other are yours the males and his the females that indeed were an unfair division they are but names which ye have named ye and your fathers for which allah hath revealed no warrant they follow but guess and that which they themselves desire and now the guidance from their lord hath come unto them or shall man have what he coveteth but unto allah belongeth the after life and the former and how many angels are in the heavens whose intercession availeth naught save after allah giveth leave to whom he chooseth and accepteth lo it is those who disbelieve in the hereafter who name the angels with the names of females and they have no knowledge thereof they follow but guess and lo guess can never take the place of the truth then withdraw muhammad from him who fleeth from our remembrance and desireth but the life of the world such is their sum of knowledge lo thy lord is best aware of him who strayeth and he is best aware of him whom goeth right and unto allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth that he may reward those who do evil with that which they have done and reward those who do good with goodness those who avoid enormities of sin and abominations save the unwilled offences for them lo thy lord is of vast mercy he is best aware of you from the time when he created you from the earth and when ye were hidden in the bellies of your mothers therefor ascribe not purity unto yourselves he is best aware of him who wardeth off evil didst thou muhammad observe him who turned away and gave little then was grudging hath he knowledge of the unseen so that he seeth or hath he not had news of what is in the books of moses and abraham who paid his debt that no laden one shall bear another load and that man hath only that for which he maketh effort and that his effort will be seen and afterward he will be repaid for it with fullest payment and that thy lord he is the goal and that he it is who maketh laugh and maketh weep and that he it is who giveth death and giveth life and that he createth the two spouses the male and the female from drop of seed when it is poured forth and that he hath ordained the second bringing forth and that he it is who enricheth and contenteth and that he it is who is the lord of sirius and that he destroyed the former tribe of ad and the tribe of thamud he spared not and the folk of noah aforetime lo they were more unjust and more rebellious and al mu tafikah he destroyed so that there covered them that which did cover concerning which then of the bounties of thy lord canst thou dispute this is warner of the warners of old the threatened hour is nigh none beside allah can disclose it marvel ye then at this statement and laugh and not weep while ye amuse yourselves rather prostrate yourselves before allah and serve him sura al qamar the moon the hour drew nigh and the moon was rent in twain and if they behold portent they turn away and say prolonged illusion they denied the truth and followed their own lusts yet everything will come to decision and surely there hath come unto them news whereof the purport should deter effective wisdom but warnings avail not so withdraw from them muhammad on the day when the summoner summoneth unto painful thing with downcast eyes they come forth from the graves as they were locusts spread abroad hastening toward the summoner the disbelievers say this is hard day the folk of noah denied before them yea they denied our slave and said madman and he was repulsed so he cried unto his lord saying am vanquished so give help then opened we the gates of heaven with pouring water and caused the earth to gush forth springs so that the waters met for predestined purpose and we carried him upon thing of planks and nails that ran upon the waters in our sight as reward for him who was rejected and verily we left it as token but is there any that remembereth then see how dreadful was my punishment after my warnings and in truth we have made the qur an easy to remember but is there any that remembereth the tribe of ad rejected warnings then how dreadful was my punishment after my warnings lo we let loose on them raging wind on day of constant calamity sweeping men away as though they were uprooted trunks of palm trees then see how dreadful was my punishment after my warnings and in truth we have made the qur an easy to remember but is there any that remembereth the tribe of thamud rejected warnings for they said is it mortal man alone among us that we are to follow then indeed we should fall into error and madness hath the remembrance been given unto him alone among us nay but he is rash liar unto their warner it was said to morrow they will know who is the rash liar lo we are sending the she camel as test for them so watch them and have patience and inform them that the water is to be shared between her and them every drinking will be witnessed but they call their comrade and he took and hamstrung her then see how dreadful was my punishment after my warnings lo we sent upon them one shout and they became as the dry twigs rejected by the builder of cattle fold and in truth we have made the qur an easy to remember but is there any that remembereth the folk of lot rejected warnings lo we sent storm of stones upon them all save the family of lot whom we rescued in the last watch of the night as grace from us thus we reward him who giveth thanks and he indeed had warned them of our blow but they did doubt the warnings they even asked of him his guests for an ill purpose then we blinded their eyes and said taste now my punishment after my warnings and in truth the punishment decreed befell them early in the morning now taste my punishment after my warnings and in truth we have made the qur an easy to remember but is there any that remembereth and warnings came in truth unto the house of pharaoh who denied our revelations every one therefore we grasped them with the grasp of the mighty the powerful are your disbelievers better than those or have ye some immunity in the scriptures or say they we are host victorious the hosts will all be routed and will turn and flee nay but the hour of doom is their appointed tryst and the hour will be more wretched and more bitter than their earthly failure lo the guilty are in error and madness on the day when they are dragged into the fire upon their faces it is said unto them feel the touch of hell lo we have created every thing by measure and our commandment is but one commandment as the twinkling of an eye and verily we have destroyed your fellows but is there any that remembereth and every thing they did is in the scriptures and every small and great thing is recorded lo the righteous will dwell among gardens and rivers firmly established in the favour of mighty king sura ar rahman the beneficent the mercy giving the beneficent hath made known the qur an he hath created man he hath taught him utterance the sun and the moon are made punctual the stars and the trees prostrate and the sky he hath uplifted and he hath set the measure that ye exceed not the measure but observe the measure strictly nor fall short thereof and the earth hath he appointed for his creatures wherein are fruit and sheathed palm trees husked grain and scented herb which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny doesn really matter what the created man of and the jinn did he create of smokeless fire which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny lord of the two easts and lord of the two wests which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny he hath loosed the two seas they meet there is barrier between them they encroach not one upon the other which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny there cometh forth from both of them the pearl and coral stone which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny his are the ships displayed upon the sea like banners which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny everyone that is thereon will pass away there remaineth but the countenance of thy lord of might and glory which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny all that are in the heavens and the earth entreat him every day he exerciseth universal power which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny we shall dispose of you ye two dependents man and jinn which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny company of jinn and men if ye have power to penetrate all regions of the heavens and the earth then penetrate them ye will never penetrate them save with our sanction which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny there will be sent against you both heat of fire and flash of brass and ye will not escape which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny and when the heaven splitteth asunder and becometh rosy like red hide which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny on that day neither man nor jinni will be questioned of his sin which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny the guilty will be known by their marks and will be taken by the forelocks and the feet which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny this is hell which the guilty deny they go circling round between it and fierce boiling water which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny but for him who feareth the standing before his lord there are two gardens which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny of spreading branches which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny wherein are two fountains flowing which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny wherein is every kind of fruit in pairs which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny reclining upon couches lined with silk brocade the fruit of both the gardens near to hand which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny therein are those of modest gaze whom neither man nor jinni will have touched before them which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny in beauty like the jacynth and the coral stone which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny is the reward of goodness aught save goodness which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny and beside them are two other gardens which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny dark green with foliage which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny wherein are two abundant springs which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny wherein is fruit the date palm and pomegranate which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny wherein are found the good and beautiful which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny fair ones close guarded in pavilions which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny whom neither man nor jinni will have touched before them which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny reclining on green cushions and fair carpets which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny blessed be the name of thy lord mighty and glorious sura al waqia the event the inevitable when the event befalleth there is no denying that it will befall abasing some exalting others when the earth is shaken with shock and the hills are ground to powder so that they become scattered dust and ye will be three kinds first those on the right hand what of those on the right hand and then those on the left hand what of those on the left hand and the foremost in the race the foremost in the race those are they who will be brought nigh in gardens of delight multitude of those of old and few of those of later time on lined couches reclining therein face to face there wait on them immortal youths with bowls and ewers and cup from pure spring wherefrom they get no aching of the head nor any madness and fruit that they prefer and flesh of fowls that they desire and there are fair ones with wide lovely eyes like unto hidden pearls reward for what they used to do there hear they no vain speaking nor recrimination naught but the saying peace and again peace and those on the right hand what of those on the right hand among thornless lote trees and clustered plantains and spreading shade and water gushing and fruit in plenty neither out of reach nor yet forbidden and raised couches lo we have created them new creation and made them virgins lovers friends for those on the right hand multitude of those of old and multitude of those of later time and those on the left hand what of those on the left hand in scorching wind and scalding water and shadow of black smoke neither cool nor refreshing lo heretofore they were effete with luxury and used to persist in the awful sin and they used to say when we are dead and have become dust and bones shall we then forsooth be raised again and also our forefathers say unto them muhammad lo those of old and those of later time will all be brought together to the tryst of an appointed day then lo ye the erring the deniers ye verily will eat of tree called zaqqum and will fill your bellies therewith and thereon ye will drink of boiling water drinking even as the camel drinketh this will be their welcome on the day of judgment we created you will ye then admit the truth have ye seen that which ye emit do ye create it or are we the creator we mete out death among you and we are not to be outrun that we may transfigure you and make you what ye know not and verily ye know the first creation why then do ye not reflect have ye seen that which ye cultivate is it ye who foster it or are we the fosterer if we willed we verily could make it chaff then would ye cease not to exclaim lo we are laden with debt nay but we are deprived have ye observed the water which ye drink is it ye who shed it from the raincloud or are we the shedder if we willed we verily could make it bitter why then give ye not thanks have ye observed the fire which ye strike out was it ye who made the tree thereof to grow or were we the grower we even we appointed it memorial and comfort for the dwellers in the wilderness therefor muhammad praise the name of thy lord the tremendous nay swear by the places of the stars and lo that verily is tremendous oath if ye but knew that this is indeed noble qur an in book kept hidden which none toucheth save the purified revelation from the lord of the worlds is it this statement that ye scorn and make denial thereof your livelihood why then when the soul cometh up to the throat of the dying and ye are at that moment looking and we are nearer unto him than ye are but ye see not why then if ye are not in bondage unto us do ye not force it back if ye are truthful thus if he is of those brought nigh then breath of life and plenty and garden of delight and if he is of those on the right hand then the greeting peace be unto thee from those on the right hand but if he is of the rejecters the erring then the welcome will be boiling water and roasting at hell fire lo this is certain truth therefor muhammad praise the name of thy lord the tremendous sura al hadid the iron all that is in the heavens and the earth glorifieth allah and he is the mighty the wise his is the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth he quickeneth and he giveth death and he is able to do all things he is the first and the last and the outward and the inward and he is knower of all things he it is who created the heavens and the earth in six days then he mounted the throne he knoweth all that entereth the earth and all that emergeth therefrom and all that cometh down from the sky and all that ascendeth therein and he is with you wheresoever ye may be and allah is seer of what ye do his is the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and unto allah all things are brought back he causeth the night to pass into the day and he causeth the day to pass into the night and he is knower of all that is in the breasts believe in allah and his messenger and spend of that whereof he hath made you trustees and such of you as believe and spend aright theirs will be great reward what aileth you that ye believe not in allah when the messenger calleth you to believe in your lord and he hath already made covenant with you if ye are believers he it is who sendeth down clear revelations unto his slave that he may bring you forth from darkness unto light and lo for you allah is full of pity merciful and what aileth you that ye spend not in the way of allah when unto allah belongeth the inheritance of the heavens and the earth those who spent and fought before the victory are not upon level with the rest of you such are greater in rank than those who spent and fought afterwards unto each hath allah promised good and allah is informed of what ye do who is he that will lend unto allah goodly loan that he may double it for him and his may be rich reward on the day when thou muhammad wilt see the believers men and women their light shining forth before them and on their right hands and wilt hear it said unto them glad news for you this day gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein ye are immortal that is the supreme triumph on the day when the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women will say unto those who believe look on us that we may borrow from your light it will be said go back and seek for light then there will separate them wall wherein is gate the inner side whereof containeth mercy while the outer side thereof is toward the doom they will cry unto them saying were we not with you they will say yea verily but ye tempted one another and hesitated and doubted and vain desires beguiled you till the ordinance of allah came to pass and the deceiver deceived you concerning allah so this day no ransom can be taken from you nor from those who disbelieved your home is the fire that is your patron and hapless journey end is not the time ripe for the hearts allah reminder and to the truth which those who received the scripture of old so their hearts were hardened and many of those who believe to submit to is revealed that they become not as but the term was prolonged for them and of them are evil livers know that allah quickeneth the earth after its death we have made clear our revelations for you that haply ye may understand lo those who give alms both men and women and lend unto allah goodly loan it will be doubled for them and theirs will be rich reward and those who believe in allah and his messengers they are the loyal and the martyrs are with their lord they have their reward and their light while as for those who disbelieve and deny our revelations they are owners of hellfire know that the life of the world is only play and idle talk and pageantry and boasting among you and rivalry in respect of wealth and children as the likeness of vegetation after rain whereof the growth is pleasing to the husbandman but afterward it drieth up and thou seest it turning yellow then it becometh straw and in the hereafter there is grievous punishment and also forgiveness from allah and his good pleasure whereas the life of the world is but matter of illusion race one with another for forgiveness from your lord and garden whereof the breadth is as the breadth of the heavens and the earth which is in store for those who believe in allah and his messengers such is the bounty of allah which he bestoweth upon whom he will and allah is of infinite bounty naught of disaster befalleth in the earth or in yourselves but it is in book before we bring it into being lo that is easy for allah that ye grieve not for the sake of that which hath escaped you nor yet exult because of that which hath been given allah loveth not all prideful boasters who hoard and who enjoin upon the people avarice and whosoever turneth away still allah is the absolute the owner of praise we verily sent our messengers with clear proofs and revealed with them the scripture and the balance that mankind may observe right measure and he revealed iron wherein is mighty power and many uses for mankind and that allah may know him who helpeth him and his messengers though unseen lo allah is strong almighty and we verily sent noah and abraham and placed the prophethood and the scripture among their seed and among them there is he who goeth right but many of them are evil livers then we caused our messengers to follow in their footsteps and we caused jesus son of mary to follow and gave him the gospel and placed compassion and mercy in the hearts of those who followed him but monasticism they invented we ordained it not for them only seeking allah pleasure and they observed it not with right observance so we give those of them who believe their reward but many of them are evil livers ye who believe be mindful of your duty to allah and put faith in his messenger he will give you twofold of his mercy and will appoint for you light wherein ye shall walk and will forgive you allah is forgiving merciful that the people of the scripture may know that they control naught of the bounty of allah but that the bounty is in allah hand to give to whom he will and allah is of infinite bounty sura al mujadila she that disputeth the pleading woman allah hath heard the saying of her that disputeth with thee muhammad concerning her husband and complaineth unto allah and allah heareth your colloquy lo allah is hearer knower such of you as put away your wives by saying they are as their mothers they are not their mothers none are their mothers except those who gave them birth they indeed utter an ill word and lie and lo allah is forgiving merciful those who put away their wives by saying they are as their mothers and afterward would go back on that which they have said the penalty in that case is the freeing of slave before they touch one another unto this ye are exhorted and allah is informed of what ye do and he who findeth not the wherewithal let him fast for two successive months before they touch one another and for him who is unable to do so the penance is the feeding of sixty needy ones this that ye may put trust in allah and his messenger such are the limits imposed by allah and for disbelievers is painful doom lo those who oppose allah and his messenger will be abased even as those before them were abased and we have sent down clear tokens and for disbelievers is shameful doom on the day when allah will raise them all together and inform them of what they did allah hath kept account of it while they forgot it and allah is witness over all things hast thou not seen that allah knoweth all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth there is no secret conference of three but he is their fourth nor of five but he is their sixth nor of less than that or more but he is with them wheresoever they may be and afterward on the day of resurrection he will inform them of what they did lo allah is knower of all things hast thou not observed those who were forbidden conspiracy and afterward returned to that which they had been forbidden and now conspire together for crime and wrongdoing and disobedience toward the messenger and when they come unto thee they greet thee with greeting wherewith allah greeteth thee not and say within themselves why should allah punish us for what we say hell will suffice them they will feel the heat thereof hapless journey end ye who believe when ye conspire together conspire not together for crime and wrongdoing and disobedience toward the messenger but conspire together for righteousness and piety and keep your duty toward allah unto whom ye will be gathered lo conspiracy is only of the devil that he may vex those who believe but he can harm them not at all unless by allah leave in allah let believers put their trust ye who believe when it is said unto you make room in assemblies then make room allah will make way for you hereafter and when it is said come up higher go up higher allah will exalt those who believe among you and those who have knowledge to high ranks allah is informed of what ye do ye who believe when ye hold conference with the messenger offer an alms before your conference that is better and purer for you but if ye cannot find the wherewithal then lo allah is forgiving merciful fear ye to offer alms before your conference then when ye do it not and allah hath forgiven you establish worship and pay the poor due and obey allah and his messenger and allah is aware of what ye do hast thou not seen those who take for friends folk with whom allah is wroth they are neither of you nor of them and they swear false oath knowingly allah hath prepared for them dreadful doom evil indeed is that which they are wont to do they make shelter of their oaths and turn men from the way of allah so theirs will be shameful doom their wealth and their children will avail them naught against allah such are rightful owners of the fire they will abide therein on the day when allah will raise them all together then will they swear unto him as they now swear unto you and they will fancy that they have some standing lo is it not they who are the liars the devil hath engrossed them and so hath caused them to forget remembrance of allah they are the devil party lo is it not the devil party who will be the losers lo those who oppose allah and his messenger they will be among the lowest allah hath decreed lo verily shall conquer and my messengers lo allah is strong almighty thou wilt not find folk who believe in allah and the last day loving those who oppose allah and his messenger even though they be their fathers or their sons or their brethren or their clan as for such he hath written faith upon their hearts and hath strengthened them with spirit from him and he will bring them into gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide allah is well pleased with them and they are well pleased with him they are allah party lo is it not allah party who are the successful sura al hashr exile banishment all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifieth allah and he is the mighty the wise he it is who hath caused those of the people of the scripture who disbelieved to go forth from their homes unto the first exile ye deemed not that they would go forth while they deemed that their strongholds would protect them from allah but allah reached them from place whereof they recked not and cast terror in their hearts so that they ruined their houses with their own hands and the hands of the believers so learn lesson ye who have eyes and if allah had not decreed migration for them he verily would have punished them in the world and theirs in the hereafter is the punishment of the fire that is because they were opposed to allah and his messenger and whoso is opposed to allah for him verily allah is stern in reprisal whatsoever palm trees ye cut down or left standing on their roots it was by allah leave in order that he might confound the evil livers and that which allah gave as spoil unto his messenger from them ye urged not any horse or riding camel for the sake thereof but allah giveth his messenger lordship over whom he will allah is able to do all things that which allah giveth as spoil unto his messenger from the people of the townships it is for allah and his messenger and for the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer that it become not commodity between the rich among you and whatsoever the messenger giveth you take it and whatsoever he forbiddeth abstain from it and keep your duty to allah lo allah is stern in reprisal and it is for the poor fugitives who have been driven out from their homes and their belongings who seek bounty from allah and help allah and his messenger they are the loyal those who entered the city and the faith before them love those who them for refuge and find in their breasts no need for that which hath given them but prefer the fugitives above themselves though poverty their lot and whoso is saved from his own avarice such are they who successful flee unto been become are and those who came into the faith after them say our lord forgive us and our brethren who were before us in the faith and place not in our hearts any rancour toward those who believe our lord thou art full of pity merciful hast thou not observed those who are hypocrites how they tell their brethren who disbelieve among the people of the scripture if ye are driven out we surely will go out with you and we will never obey anyone against you and if ye are attacked we verily will help you and allah beareth witness that they verily are liars for indeed if they are driven out they go not out with them and indeed if they are attacked they help them not and indeed if they had helped them they would have turned and fled and then they would not have been victorious ye are more awful as fear in their bosoms than allah that is because they are folk who understand not they will not fight against you in body save in fortified villages or from behind walls their adversity among themselves is very great ye think of them as whole whereas their hearts are divers that is because they are folk who have no sense on the likeness of those who suffered short time before them they taste the ill effects of their own conduct and theirs is painful punishment and the hypocrites are on the likeness of the devil when he telleth man to disbelieve then when he disbelieveth saith lo am quit of thee lo fear allah the lord of the worlds and the consequence for both will be that they are in the fire therein abiding such is the reward of evil doers ye who believe observe your duty to allah and let every soul look to that which it sendeth on before for the morrow and observe your duty to allah lo allah is informed of what ye do and be not ye as those who forgot allah therefor he caused them to forget their souls such are the evil doers not equal are the owners of the fire and the owners of the garden the owners of the garden they are the victorious if we had caused this qur an to descend upon mountain thou muhammad verily hadst seen it humbled rent asunder by the fear of allah such similitudes coin we for mankind that haply they may reflect he is allah than whom there is no other allah the knower of the invisible and the visible he is the beneficent merciful he is allah than whom there is no other allah the sovereign lord the holy one peace the keeper of faith the guardian the majestic the compeller the superb glorified be allah from all that they ascribe as partner unto him he is allah the creator the shaper out of naught the fashioner his are the most beautiful names all that is in the heavens and the earth glorifieth him and he is the mighty the wise sura al mumtahina she that is to be examined examining her ye who believe choose not my enemy and your enemy for allies do ye give them friendship when they disbelieve in that truth which hath come unto you driving out the messenger and you because ye believe in allah your lord if ye have come forth to strive in my way and seeking my good pleasure show them not friendship do ye show friendship unto them in secret when am best aware of what ye hide and what ye proclaim and whosoever doeth it among you he verily hath strayed from the right way if they have the upper hand of you they will be your foes and will stretch out their hands and their tongues toward you with evil intent and they long for you to disbelieve your ties of kindred and your children will avail you naught upon the day of resurrection he will part you allah is seer of what ye do there is goodly pattern for you in abraham and those with him when they told their folk lo we are guiltless of you and all that ye worship beside allah we have done with you and there hath arisen between us and you hostility and hate for ever until ye believe in allah only save that which abraham promised his father when he said will ask forgiveness for thee though own nothing for thee from allah our lord in thee we put our trust and unto thee we turn repentant and unto thee is the journeying our lord make us not prey for those who disbelieve and forgive us our lord lo thou only thou are the mighty the wise verily ye have in them goodly pattern for everyone who looketh to allah and the last day and whosoever may turn away lo still allah he is the absolute the owner of praise it may be that allah will ordain love between you and those of them with whom ye are at enmity allah is mighty and allah is forgiving merciful allah forbiddeth you not those who warred not against you on account of religion and drove you not out from your homes that ye should show them kindness and deal justly with them lo allah loveth the just dealers allah forbiddeth you only those who warred against you on account of religion and have driven you out from your homes and helped to drive you out that ye make friends of them whosoever maketh friends of them all such are wrongdoers ye who believe when believing women come unto you as fugitives examine them allah is best aware of their faith then if ye know them for true believers send them not back unto the disbelievers they are not lawful for them the disbelievers nor are they the disbelievers lawful for them and give them the disbelievers that which they have spent upon them and it is no sin for you to marry such women when ye have given them their dues and hold not to the ties of disbelieving women and ask for the return of that which ye have spent and let them the disbelievers ask for that which they have spent that is the judgment of allah he judgeth between you allah is knower wise and if any of your wives have gone from you unto the disbelievers and afterward ye have your turn of triumph then give unto those whose wives have gone the like of that which they have spent and keep your duty to allah in whom ye are believers prophet if believing women come unto thee taking oath of allegiance unto thee that they will ascribe no thing as partner unto allah and will neither steal nor commit adultery nor kill their children nor produce any lie that they have devised between their hands and feet nor disobey thee in what is right then accept their allegiance and ask allah to forgive them lo allah is forgiving merciful ye who believe be not friendly with folk with whom allah is wroth folk who have despaired of the hereafter as the disbelievers despair of those who are in the graves sura as saff the ranks battle array all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifieth allah and he is the mighty the wise ye who believe why say ye that which ye do not it is most hateful in the sight of allah that ye say that which ye do not lo allah loveth them who battle for his cause in ranks as if they were solid structure and remember when moses said unto his people my people why persecute ye me when ye well know that am allah messenger unto you so when they went astray allah sent their hearts astray and allah guideth not the evil living folk and when jesus son of mary said children of israel lo am the messenger of allah unto you confirming that which was revealed before me in the torah and bringing good tidings of messenger who cometh after me whose name is the praised one yet when he hath come unto them with clear proofs they say this is mere magic and who doeth greater wrong than he who inventeth lie against allah when he is summoned unto al islam and allah guideth not wrongdoing folk fain would they put out the light of allah with their mouths but allah will perfect his light however much the disbelievers are averse he it is who hath sent his messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth that he may make it conqueror of all religion however much idolaters may be averse ye who believe shall show you commerce that will save you from painful doom ye should believe in allah and his messenger and should strive for the cause of allah with your wealth and your lives that is better for you if ye did but know he will forgive you your sins and bring you into gardens underneath which rivers flow and pleasant dwellings in gardens of eden that is the supreme triumph and he will give you another blessing which ye love help from allah and present victory give good tidings muhammad to believers ye who believe be allah helpers even as jesus son of mary said unto the disciples who are my helpers for allah they said we are allah helpers and party of the children of israel believed while party disbelieved then we strengthened those who believed against their foe and they became the uppermost sura al jumua the congregation friday all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifieth allah the sovereign lord the holy one the mighty the wise he it is who hath sent among the unlettered ones messenger of their own to recite unto them his revelations and to make them grow and to teach them the scripture and wisdom though heretofore they were indeed in error manifest along with others of them who have not yet joined them he is the mighty the wise that is the bounty of allah which he giveth unto whom he will allah is of infinite bounty the likeness of those who are entrusted with the law of moses yet apply it not is as the likeness of the ass carrying books wretched is the likeness of folk who deny the revelations of allah and allah guideth not wrongdoing folk say muhammad ye who are jews if ye claim that ye are favoured of allah apart from all mankind then long for death if ye are truthful but they will never long for it because of all that their own hands have sent before and allah is aware of evil doers say unto them muhammad lo the death from which ye shrink will surely meet you and afterward ye will be returned unto the knower of the invisible and the visible and he will tell you what ye used to do ye who believe when the call is heard for the prayer of the day of congregation haste unto remembrance of allah and leave your trading that is better for you if ye did but know and when the prayer is ended then disperse in the land and seek of allah bounty and remember allah much that ye may be successful but when they spy some merchandise or pastime they break away to it and leave thee standing say that which allah hath is better than pastime and than merchandise and allah is the best of providers sura al munafiqoon the hypocrites when the hypocrites come unto thee muhammad they say we bear witness that thou art indeed allah messenger and allah knoweth that thou art indeed his messenger and allah beareth witness that the hypocrites indeed are speaking falsely they make their faith pretext so that they may turn men from the way of allah verily evil is that which they are wont to do that is because they believed then disbelieved therefore their hearts are sealed so that they understand not and when thou seest them their figures please thee and if they speak thou givest ear unto their speech they are as though they were blocks of wood in striped cloaks they deem every shout to be against them they are the enemy so beware of them allah confound them how they are perverted and when it is said unto them come the messenger of allah will ask forgiveness for you they avert their faces and thou seest them turning away disdainful whether thou ask forgiveness for them or ask not forgiveness for them is all one for them allah will not forgive them lo allah guideth not the evil living folk they it is who say spend not on behalf of those who dwell with allah messenger that they may disperse and go away from you when allah are the treasures of the heavens and the earth but the hypocrites comprehend not they say surely if we return to al madinah the mightier will soon drive out the weaker when might belongeth to allah and to his messenger and to the believers but the hypocrites know not ye who believe let not your wealth nor your children distract you from remembrance of allah those who do so they are the losers and spend of that wherewith we have provided you before death cometh unto one of you and he saith my lord if only thou wouldst reprieve me for little while then would give alms and be among the righteous but allah reprieveth no soul when its term cometh and allah is informed of what ye do sura at taghabun mutual disillusion haggling all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifieth allah unto him belongeth sovereignty and unto him belongeth praise and he is able to do all things he it is who created you but one of you is disbeliever and one of you is believer and allah is seer of what ye do he created the heavens and the earth with truth and he shaped you and made good your shapes and unto him is the journeying he knoweth all that is in the heavens and the earth and he knoweth what ye conceal and what ye publish and allah is aware of what is in the breasts of men hath not the story reached you of those who disbelieved of old and so did taste the ill effects of their conduct and theirs will be painful doom that was because their messengers from allah kept coming unto them with clear proofs of allah sovereignty but they said shall mere mortals guide us so they disbelieved and turned away and allah was independent of them allah is absolute owner of praise those who disbelieve assert that they will not be raised again say unto them muhammad yea verily by my lord ye will be raised again and then ye will be informed of what ye did and that is easy for allah so believe in allah and his messenger and the light which we have revealed and allah is informed of what ye do the day when he shall gather you unto the day of assembling that will be day of mutual disillusion and whoso believeth in allah and doeth right he will remit from him his evil deeds and will bring him unto gardens underneath which rivers flow therein to abide for ever that is the supreme triumph but those who disbelieve and deny our revelations such are owners of the fire they will abide therein hapless journey end no calamity befalleth save by allah leave and whosoever believeth in allah he guideth his heart and allah is knower of all things obey allah and obey his messenger but if ye turn away then the duty of our messenger is only to convey the message plainly allah there is no allah save him in allah therefore let believers put their trust ye who believe lo among your wives and your children there are enemies for you therefor beware of them and if ye efface and overlook and forgive then lo allah is forgiving merciful your wealth and your children are only temptation whereas allah with him is an immense reward so keep your duty to allah as best ye can and listen and obey and spend that is better for your souls and whoso is saved from his own greed such are the successful if ye lend unto allah goodly loan he will double it for you and will forgive you for allah is responsive clement knower of the invisible and the visible the mighty the wise sura at talaq divorce prophet when ye men put away women put them away for their legal period and reckon the period and keep your duty to allah your lord expel them not from their houses nor let them go forth unless they commit open immorality such are the limits imposed by allah and whoso transgresseth allah limits he verily wrongeth his soul thou knowest not it may be that allah will afterward bring some new thing to pass then when they have reached their term take them back in kindness or part from them in kindness and call to witness two just men among you and keep your testimony upright for allah whoso believeth in allah and the last day is exhorted to act thus and whosoever keepeth his duty to allah allah will appoint way out for him and will provide for him from quarter whence he hath no expectation and whosoever putteth his trust in allah he will suffice him lo allah bringeth his command to pass allah hath set measure for all things and for such of your women as despair of menstruation if ye doubt their period of waiting shall be three months along with those who have it not and for those with child their period shall be till they bring forth their burden and whosoever keepeth his duty to allah he maketh his course easy for him that is the commandment of allah which he revealeth unto you and whoso keepeth his duty to allah he will remit from him his evil deeds and magnify reward for him lodge them where ye dwell according to your wealth and harass them not so as to straiten life for them and if they are with child then spend for them till they bring forth their burden then if they give suck for you give them their due payment and consult together in kindness but if ye make difficulties for one another then let some other woman give suck for him the father of the child let him who hath abundance spend of his abundance and he whose provision is measured let him spend of that which allah hath given him allah asketh naught of any soul save that which he hath given it allah will vouchsafe after hardship ease and how many community revolted against the ordinance of its lord and his messengers and we called it to stern account and punished it with dire punishment so that it tasted the ill effects of its conduct and the consequence of its conduct was loss allah hath prepared for them stern punishment so keep your duty to allah men of understanding ye who believe now allah hath sent down unto you reminder messenger reciting unto you the revelations of allah made plain that he may bring forth those who believe and do good works from darkness unto light and whosoever believeth in allah and doeth right he will bring him into gardens underneath which rivers flow therein to abide for ever allah hath made good provision for him allah it is who hath created seven heavens and of the earth the like thereof the commandment cometh down among them slowly that ye may know that allah is able to do all things and that allah surroundeth all things in knowledge sura at tahrim banning prohibition prophet why bannest thou that which allah hath made lawful for thee seeking to please thy wives and allah is forgiving merciful allah hath made lawful for you muslims absolution from your oaths of such kind and allah is your protector he is the knower the wise when the prophet confided fact unto one of his wives and when she afterward divulged it and allah apprised him thereof he made known to her part thereof and passed over part and when he told it her she said who hath told thee he said the knower the aware hath told me if ye twain turn unto allah repentant ye have cause to do so for your hearts desired the ban and if ye aid one another against him muhammad then lo allah even he is his protecting friend and gabriel and the righteous among the believers and furthermore the angels are his helpers it may happen that his lord if he divorce you will give him in your stead wives better than you submissive to allah believing pious penitent devout inclined to fasting widows and maids ye who believe ward off from yourselves and your families fire whereof the fuel is men and stones over which are set angels strong severe who resist not allah in that which he commandeth them but do that which they are commanded then it will be said ye who disbelieve make no excuses for yourselves this day ye are only being paid for what ye used to do ye who believe turn unto allah in sincere repentance it may be that your lord will remit from you your evil deeds and bring you into gardens underneath which rivers flow on the day when allah will not abase the prophet and those who believe with him their light will run before them and on their right hands they will say our lord perfect our light for us and forgive us lo thou art able to do all things prophet strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be stern with them hell will be their home hapless journey end allah citeth an example for those who disbelieve the wife of noah and the wife of lot who were under two of our righteous slaves yet betrayed them so that they the husbands availed them naught against allah and it was said unto them enter the fire along with those who enter and allah citeth an example for those who believe the wife of pharaoh when she said my lord build for me home with thee in the garden and deliver me from pharaoh and his work and deliver me from evil doing folk and mary daughter of imran whose body was chaste therefor we breathed therein something of our spirit and she put faith in the words of her lord and his scriptures and was of the obedient sura al mulk the sovereignty control blessed is he in whose hand is the sovereignty and he is able to do all things who hath created life and death that he may try you which of you is best in conduct and he is the mighty the forgiving who hath created seven heavens in harmony thou muhammad canst see no fault in the beneficent one creation then look again canst thou see any rifts then look again and yet again thy sight will return unto thee weakened and made dim and verily we have beautified the world heaven with lamps and we have made them missiles for the devils and for them we have prepared the doom of flame and for those who disbelieve in their lord there is the doom of hell hapless journey end when they are flung therein they hear its roaring as it boileth up as it would burst with rage whenever fresh host is flung therein the wardens thereof ask them came there unto you no warner they say yea verily warner came unto us but we denied and said allah hath naught revealed ye are in naught but great error and they say had we been wont to listen or have sense we had not been among the dwellers in the flames so they acknowledge their sins but far removed from mercy are the dwellers in the flames lo those who fear their lord in secret theirs will be forgiveness and great reward and keep your opinion secret or proclaim it lo he is knower of all that is in the breasts of men should he not know what he created and he is the subtile the aware he it is who hath made the earth subservient unto you so walk in the paths thereof and eat of his providence and unto him will be the resurrection of the dead have ye taken security from him who is in the heaven that he will not cause the earth to swallow you when lo it is convulsed or have ye taken security from him who is in the heaven that he will not let loose on you hurricane but ye shall know the manner of my warning and verily those before them denied then see the manner of my wrath with them have they not seen the birds above them spreading out their wings and closing them naught upholdeth them save the beneficent lo he is seer of all things or who is he that will be an army unto you to help you instead of the beneficent the disbelievers are in naught but illusion or who is he that will provide for you if he should withhold his providence nay but they are set in pride and frowardness is he who goeth groping on his face more rightly guided or he who walketh upright on straight road say unto them muhammad he it is who gave you being and hath assigned unto you ears and eyes and hearts small thanks give ye say he it is who multiplieth you in the earth and unto whom ye will be gathered and they say when will this promise be fulfilled if ye are truthful say the knowledge is with allah only and am but plain warner but when they see it nigh the faces of those who disbelieve will be awry and it will be said unto them this is that for which ye used to call say muhammad have ye thought whether allah causeth me muhammad and those with me to perish or hath mercy on us still who will protect the disbelievers from painful doom say he is the beneficent in him we believe and in him we put our trust and ye will soon know who it is that is in error manifest say have ye thought if all your water were to disappear into the earth who then could bring you gushing water sura al qalam the pen nun by the pen and that which they write therewith thou art not for thy lord favour unto thee madman and lo thine verily will be reward unfailing and lo thou art of tremendous nature and thou wilt see and they will see which of you is the demented lo thy lord is best aware of him who strayeth from his way and he is best aware of those who walk aright therefor obey not thou the rejecters who would have had thee compromise that they may compromise neither obey thou each feeble oath monger detracter spreader abroad of slanders hinderer of the good transgressor malefactor greedy therewithal intrusive it is because he is possessed of wealth and children that when our revelations are recited unto him he saith mere fables of the men of old we shall brand him on the nose lo we have tried them as we tried the owners of the garden when they vowed that they would pluck its fruit next morning and made no exception for the will of allah then visitation from thy lord came upon it while they slept and in the morning it was as if plucked and they cried out one unto another in the morning saying run unto your field if ye would pluck the fruit so they went off saying one unto another in low tones no needy man shall enter it to day against you they went betimes strong in this purpose but when they saw it they said lo we are in error nay but we are desolate the best among them said said not unto you why glorify ye not allah they said glorified be our lord lo we have been wrong doers then some of them drew near unto others self reproaching they said alas for us in truth we were outrageous it may be that our lord will give us better than this in place thereof lo we beseech our lord such was the punishment and verily the punishment of the hereafter is greater if they did but know lo for those who keep from evil are gardens of bliss with their lord shall we then treat those who have surrendered as we treat the guilty what aileth you how foolishly ye judge or have ye scripture wherein ye learn that ye shall indeed have all that ye choose or have ye covenant on oath from us that reacheth to the day of judgment that yours shall be all that ye ordain ask them muhammad which of them will vouch for that or have they other gods then let them bring their other gods if they are truthful on the day when it befalleth in earnest and they are ordered to prostrate themselves but are not able with eyes downcast abasement stupefying them and they had been summoned to prostrate themselves while they were yet unhurt leave me to deal with those who give the lie to this pronouncement we shall lead them on by steps from whence they know not yet bear with them for lo my scheme is firm or dost thou muhammad ask fee from them so that they are heavily taxed or is the unseen theirs that they can write thereof but wait thou for thy lord decree and be not like him of the fish who cried out in despair had it not been that favour from his lord had reached him he surely had been cast into the wilderness while he was reprobate but his lord chose him and placed him among the righteous and lo those who disbelieve would fain disconcert thee with their eyes when they hear the reminder and they say lo he is indeed mad when it is naught else than reminder to creation sura al haaqqa the reality the reality what is the reality ah what will convey unto thee what the reality is the tribes of thamud and ad disbelieved in the judgment to come as for thamud they were destroyed by the lightning and as for ad they were destroyed by fierce roaring wind which he imposed on them for seven long nights and eight long days so that thou mightest have seen men lying overthrown as they were hollow trunks of palm trees canst thou muhammad see any remnant of them and pharaoh and those before him and the communities that were destroyed brought error and they disobeyed the messenger of their lord therefor did he grip them with tightening grip lo when the waters rose we carried you upon the ship that we might make it memorial for you and that remembering ears that heard the story might remember and when the trumpet shall sound one blast and the earth with the mountains shall be lifted up and crushed with one crash then on that day will the event befall and the heaven will split asunder for that day it will be frail and the angels will be on the sides thereof and eight will uphold the throne of thy lord that day above them on that day ye will be exposed not secret of you will be hidden then as for him who is given his record in his right hand he will say take read my book surely knew that should have to meet my reckoning then he will be in blissful state in high garden whereof the clusters are in easy reach and it will be said unto those therein eat and drink at ease for that which ye sent on before you in past days but as for him who is given his record in his left hand he will say oh would that had not been given my book and knew not what my reckoning oh would that it had been death my wealth hath not availed me my power hath gone from me it will be said take him and fetter him and then expose him to hell fire and then insert him in chain whereof the length is seventy cubits lo he used not to believe in allah the tremendous and urged not on the feeding of the wretched therefor hath he no lover here this day nor any food save filth which none but sinners eat but nay swear by all that ye see and all that ye see not that it is indeed the speech of an illustrious messenger it is not poet speech little is it that ye believe nor diviner speech little is it that ye remember it is revelation from the lord of the worlds and if he had invented false sayings concerning us we assuredly had taken him by the right hand and then severed his life artery and not one of you could have held us off from him and lo it is warrant unto those who ward off evil and lo we know that some among you will deny it and lo it is indeed an anguish for the disbelievers and lo it is absolute truth so glorify the name of thy tremendous lord sura al maarij the ascending stairways questioner questioned concerning the doom about to fall upon the disbelievers which none can repel from allah lord of the ascending stairways whereby the angels and the spirit ascend unto him in day whereof the span is fifty thousand years but be patient muhammad with patience fair to see lo they behold it afar off while we behold it nigh the day when the sky will become as molten copper and the hills become as flakes of wool and no familiar friend will ask question of his friend though they will be given sight of them the guilty man will long to be able to ransom himself from the punishment of that day at the price of his children and his spouse and his brother and his kin that harboured him and all that are in the earth if then it might deliver him but nay for lo it is the fire of hell eager to roast it calleth him who turned and fled from truth and hoarded wealth and withheld it lo man was created anxious fretful when evil befalleth him and when good befalleth him grudging save worshippers who are constant at their worship and in whose wealth there is right acknowledged for the beggar and the destitute and those who believe in the day of judgment and those who are fearful of their lord doom lo the doom of their lord is that before which none can feel secure and those who preserve their chastity save with their wives and those whom their right hands possess for thus they are not blameworthy but whoso seeketh more than that those are they who are transgressors and those who keep their pledges and their covenant and those who stand by their testimony and those who are attentive at their worship these will dwell in gardens honoured what aileth those who disbelieve that they keep staring toward thee muhammad open eyed on the right and on the left in groups doth every man among them hope to enter the garden of delight nay verily lo we created them from what they know but nay swear by the lord of the rising places and the setting places of the planets that we verily are able to replace them by others better than them and we are not to be outrun so let them chat and play until they meet their day which they are promised the day when they come forth from the graves in haste as racing to goal with eyes aghast abasement stupefying them such is the day which they are promised sura nooh nooh lo we sent noah unto his people saying warn thy people ere the painful doom come unto them he said my people lo am plain warner unto you bidding you serve allah and keep your duty unto him and obey me that he may forgive you somewhat of your sins and respite you to an appointed term lo the term of allah when it cometh cannot be delayed if ye but knew he said my lord lo have called unto my people night and day but all my calling doth but add to their repugnance and lo whenever call unto them that thou mayst pardon them they thrust their fingers in their ears and cover themselves with their garments and persist in their refusal and magnify themselves in pride and lo have called unto them aloud and lo have made public proclamation unto them and have appealed to them in private and have said seek pardon of your lord lo he was ever forgiving he will let loose the sky for you in plenteous rain and will help you with wealth and sons and will assign unto you gardens and will assign unto you rivers what aileth you that ye hope not toward allah for dignity when he created you by divers stages see ye not how allah hath created seven heavens in harmony and hath made the moon light therein and made the sun lamp and allah hath caused you to grow as growth from the earth and afterward he maketh you return thereto and he will bring you forth again new forthbringing and allah hath made the earth wide expanse for you that ye may thread the valley ways thereof noah said my lord lo they have disobeyed me and followed one whose wealth and children increase him in naught save ruin and they have plotted mighty plot and they have said forsake not your gods forsake not wadd nor suwa nor yaghuth and ya uq and nasr and they have led many astray and thou increasest the wrong doers in naught save error because of their sins they were drowned then made to enter fire and they found they had no helpers in place of allah and noah said my lord leave not one of the disbelievers in the land if thou shouldst leave them they will mislead thy slaves and will beget none save lewd ingrates my lord forgive me and my parents and him who entereth my house believing and believing men and believing women and increase not the wrong doers in aught save ruin sura al jinn the jinn say muhammad it is revealed unto me that company of the jinn gave ear and they said lo we have heard marvellous qur an which guideth unto righteousness so we believe in it and we ascribe no partner unto our lord and we believe that he exalted be the glory of our lord hath taken neither wife nor son and that the foolish one among us used to speak concerning allah an atrocious lie and lo we had supposed that humankind and jinn would not speak lie concerning allah and indeed muhammad individuals of humankind used to invoke the protection of individuals of the jinn so that they increased them in revolt against allah and indeed they supposed even as ye suppose that allah would not raise anyone from the dead and the jinn who had listened to the qur an said we had sought the heaven but had found it filled with strong warders and meteors and we used to sit on places high therein to listen but he who listeneth now findeth flame in wait for him and we know not whether harm is boded unto all who are in the earth or whether their lord intendeth guidance for them and among us there are righteous folk and among us there are far from that we are sects having different rules and we know that we cannot escape from allah in the earth nor can we escape by flight and when we heard the guidance we believed therein and whoso believeth in his lord he feareth neither loss nor oppression and there are among us some who have surrendered to allah and there are among us some who are unjust and whoso hath surrendered to allah such have taken the right path purposefully and as for those who are unjust they are firewood for hell if they the idolaters tread the right path we shall give them to drink of water in abundance that we may test them thereby and whoso turneth away from the remembrance of his lord he will thrust him into ever growing torment and the places of worship are only for allah so pray not unto anyone along with allah and when the slave of allah stood up in prayer to him they crowded on him almost stifling say unto them muhammad pray unto allah only and ascribe unto him no partner say lo control not hurt nor benefit for you say lo none can protect me from allah nor can find any refuge beside him mine is but conveyance of the truth from allah and his messages and whoso disobeyeth allah and his messenger lo his is fire of hell wherein such dwell for ever till the day when they shall behold that which they are promised they may doubt but then they will know for certain who is weaker in allies and less in multitude say muhammad unto the disbelievers know not whether that which ye are promised is nigh or if my lord hath set distant term for it he is the knower of the unseen and he revealeth unto none his secret save unto every messenger whom he hath chosen and then he maketh guard to go before him and guard behind him that he may know that they have indeed conveyed the messages of their lord he surroundeth all their doings and he keepeth count of all things sura al muzzammil the enshrouded one bundled up thou wrapped up in thy raiment keep vigil the night long save little half thereof or abate little thereof or add little thereto and chant the qur an in measure for we shall charge thee with word of weight lo the vigil of the night is time when impression is more keen and speech more certain lo thou hast by day chain of business so remember the name of thy lord and devote thyself with complete devotion lord of the east and the west there is no allah save him so choose thou him alone for thy defender and bear with patience what they utter and part from them with fair leave taking leave me to deal with the deniers lords of ease and comfort in this life and do thou respite them awhile lo with us are heavy fetters and raging fire and food which choketh the partaker and painful doom on the day when the earth and the hills rock and the hills become heap of running sand lo we have sent unto you messenger as witness against you even as we sent unto pharaoh messenger but pharaoh rebelled against the messenger whereupon we seized him with no gentle grip then how if ye disbelieve will ye protect yourselves upon the day which will turn children grey the very heaven being then rent asunder his promise is to be fulfilled lo this is reminder let him who will then choose way unto his lord lo thy lord knoweth how thou keepest vigil sometimes nearly two thirds of the night or sometimes half or third thereof as do party of those with thee allah measureth the night and the day he knoweth that ye count it not and turneth unto you in mercy recite then of the qur an that which is easy for you he knoweth that there are sick folk among you while others travel in the land in search of allah bounty and others still are fighting for the cause of allah so recite of it that which is easy for you and establish worship and pay the poor due and so lend unto allah goodly loan whatsoever good ye send before you for your souls ye will find it with allah better and greater in the recompense and seek forgiveness of allah lo allah is forgiving merciful sura al muddaththir the cloaked one the man wearing cloak thou enveloped in thy cloak arise and warn thy lord magnify thy raiment purify pollution shun and show not favour seeking wordly gain for the sake of thy lord be patient for when the trumpet shall sound surely that day will be day of anguish not of ease for disbelievers leave me to deal with him whom created lonely and then bestowed upon him ample means and sons abiding in his presence and made life smooth for him yet he desireth that should give more nay for lo he hath been stubborn to our revelations on him shall impose fearful doom for lo he did consider then he planned self destroyed is he how he planned again self destroyed is he how he planned then looked he then frowned he and showed displeasure then turned he away in pride and said this is naught else than magic from of old this is naught else than speech of mortal man him shall fling unto the burning ah what will convey unto thee what that burning is it leaveth naught it spareth naught it shrivelleth the man above it are nineteen we have appointed only angels to be wardens of the fire and their number have we made to be stumbling block for those who disbelieve that those to whom the scripture hath been given may have certainty and that believers may increase in faith and that those to whom the scripture hath been given and believers may not doubt and that those in whose hearts there is disease and disbelievers may say what meaneth allah by this similitude thus allah sendeth astray whom he will and whom he will he guideth none knoweth the hosts of thy lord save him this is naught else than reminder unto mortals nay by the moon and the night when it withdraweth and the dawn when it shineth forth lo this is one of the greatest portents as warning unto men unto him of you who will advance or hang back every soul is pledge for its own deeds save those who will stand on the right hand in gardens they will ask one another concerning the guilty what hath brought you to this burning they will answer we were not of those who prayed nor did we feed the wretched we used to wade in vain dispute with all waders and we used to deny the day of judgment till the inevitable came unto us the mediation of no mediators will avail them then why now turn they away from the admonishment as they were frightened asses fleeing from lion nay but everyone of them desireth that he should be given open pages from allah nay verily they fear not the hereafter nay verily lo this is an admonishment so whosoever will may heed and they will not heed unless allah willeth it he is the fount of fear he is the fount of mercy sura al qiyama the rising of the dead resurrection nay swear by the day of resurrection nay swear by the accusing soul that this scripture is true thinketh man that we shall not assemble his bones yea verily we are able to restore his very fingers but man would fain deny what is before him

is the recourse that day on that day man is told the tale of that which he hath sent before and left behind oh but man is telling witness against himself although he tender his excuses stir not thy tongue herewith to hasten it lo upon us resteth the putting together thereof and the reading thereof and when we read it follow thou the reading then lo upon us resteth the explanation thereof nay but ye do love the fleeting now and neglect the hereafter that day will faces be resplendent looking toward their lord and that day will other faces be despondent thou wilt know that some great disaster is about to fall on them nay but when the life cometh up to the throat and men say where is the wizard who can save him now and he knoweth that it is the parting and agony is heaped on agony unto thy lord that day will be the driving for he neither trusted nor prayed but he denied and flouted then went he to his folk with glee nearer unto thee and nearer again nearer unto thee and nearer is the doom thinketh man that he is to be left aimless was he not drop of fluid which gushed forth then he became clot then allah shaped and fashioned and made of him pair the male and female is not he who doeth so able to bring the dead to life sura al insan man hath there come upon man ever any period of time in which he was thing unremembered lo we create man from drop of thickened fluid to test him so we make him hearing knowing lo we have shown him the way whether he be grateful or disbelieving lo we have prepared for disbelievers manacles and carcans and raging fire lo the righteous shall drink of cup whereof the mixture is of kafur spring wherefrom the slaves of allah drink making it gush forth abundantly because they perform the vow and fear day whereof the evil is widespreading and feed with food the needy wretch the orphan and the prisoner for love of him saying we feed you for the sake of allah only we wish for no reward nor thanks from you lo we fear from our lord day of frowning and of fate therefor allah hath warded off from them the evil of that day and hath made them find brightness and joy and hath awarded them for all that they endured garden and silk attire reclining therein upon couches they will find there neither heat of sun nor bitter cold the shade thereof is close upon them and the clustered fruits thereof bow down goblets of silver are brought round for them and beakers as of glass bright as glass but made of silver which they themselves have measured to the measure of their deeds there are they watered with cup whereof the mixture is of zanjabil the water of spring therein named salsabil there wait on them immortal youths whom when thou seest thou wouldst take for scattered pearls when thou seest thou wilt see there bliss and high estate their raiment will be fine green silk and gold embroidery bracelets of silver will they wear their lord will slake their thirst with pure drink and it will be said unto them lo this is reward for you your endeavour upon earth hath found acceptance lo we even we have revealed unto thee the qur an revelation so submit patiently to thy lord command and obey not of them any guilty one or disbeliever remember the name of thy lord at morn and evening and worship him portion of the night and glorify him through the livelong night lo these love fleeting life and put behind them the remembrance of grievous day we even we created them and strengthened their frame and when we will we can replace them bringing others like them in their stead lo this is an admonishment that whosoever will may choose way unto his lord yet ye will not unless allah willeth lo allah is knower wise he maketh whom he will to enter his mercy and for evil doers hath prepared painful doom sura al mursalat the emissaries winds sent forth by the emissary winds sent one after another by the raging hurricanes by those which cause earth vegetation to revive by those who winnow with winnowing by those who bring down the reminder to excuse or to warn surely that which ye are promised will befall so when the stars are put out and when the sky is riven asunder and when the mountains are blown away and when the messengers are brought unto their time appointed for what day is the time appointed for the day of decision and what will convey unto thee what the day of decision is woe unto the repudiators on that day destroyed we not the former folk then caused the latter folk to follow after thus deal we ever with the guilty woe unto the repudiators on that day did we not create you from base fluid which we laid up in safe abode for known term thus we arranged how excellent is our arranging woe unto the repudiators on that day have we not made the earth receptacle both for the living and the dead and placed therein high mountains and given you to drink sweet water therein woe unto the repudiators on that day it will be said unto them depart unto that doom which ye used to deny depart unto the shadow falling threefold which yet is no relief nor shelter from the flame lo it throweth up sparks like the castles or as it might be camels of bright yellow hue woe unto the repudiators on that day this is day wherein they speak not nor are they suffered to put forth excuses woe unto the repudiators on that day this is the day of decision we have brought you and the men of old together if now ye have any wit outwit me woe unto the repudiators on that day lo those who kept their duty are amid shade and fountains and fruits such as they desire unto them it is said eat drink and welcome ye blessed in return for what ye did thus do we reward the good woe unto the repudiators on that day eat and take your ease on earth little lo ye are guilty woe unto the repudiators on that day when it is said unto them bow down they bow not down woe unto the repudiators on that day in what statement after this will they believe sura an naba the tidings the announcement whereof do they question one another it is of the awful tidings concerning which they are in disagreement nay but they will come to know nay again but they will come to know have we not made the earth an expanse and the high hills bulwarks and we have created you in pairs and have appointed your sleep for repose and have appointed the night as cloak and have appointed the day for livelihood and we have built above you seven strong heavens and have appointed dazzling lamp and have sent down from the rainy clouds abundant water thereby to produce grain and plant and gardens of thick foliage lo the day of decision is fixed time day when the trumpet is blown and ye come in multitudes and the heaven is opened and becometh as gates and the hills are set in motion and become as mirage lo hell lurketh in ambush home for the rebellious they will abide therein for ages therein taste they neither coolness nor any drink save boiling water and paralysing cold reward proportioned to their evil deeds for lo they looked not for reckoning they called our revelations false with strong denial everything have we recorded in book so taste of that which ye have earned no increase do we give you save of torment lo for the duteous is achievement gardens enclosed and vineyards and voluptuous women of equal age and full cup there hear they never vain discourse nor lying requital from thy lord gift in payment lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them the beneficent with whom none can converse on the day when the angels and the spirit stand arrayed they speak not saving him whom the beneficent alloweth and who speaketh right that is the true day so whoso will should seek recourse unto his lord lo we warn you of doom at hand day whereon man will look on that which his own hands have sent before and the disbeliever will cry would that were dust sura an naziat those who drag forth soulsnatchers by those who drag forth to destruction by the meteors rushing by the lone stars floating by the angels hastening and those who govern the event on the day when the first trump resoundeth and the second followeth it on that day hearts beat painfully while eyes are downcast now they are saying shall we really be restored to our first state even after we are crumbled bones they say then that would be vain proceeding surely it will need but one shout and lo they will be awakened hath there come unto thee the history of moses how his lord called him in the holy vale of tuwa saying go thou unto pharaoh lo he hath rebelled and say unto him hast thou will to grow in grace then will guide thee to thy lord and thou shalt fear him and he showed him the tremendous token but he denied and disobeyed then turned he away in haste then gathered he and summoned and proclaimed pharaoh am your lord the highest so allah seized him and made him an example for the after life and for the former lo herein is indeed lesson for him who feareth are ye the harder to create or is the heaven that he built he raised the height thereof and ordered it and he made dark the night thereof and he brought forth the morn thereof and after that he spread the earth and produced therefrom the water thereof and the pasture thereof and he made fast the hills provision for you and for your cattle but when the great disaster cometh the day when man will call to mind his whole endeavour and hell will stand forth visible to him who seeth then as for him who rebelled and chose the life of the world lo hell will be his home but as for him who feared to stand before his lord and restrained his soul from lust lo the garden will be his home they ask thee of the hour when will it come to port why ask they what hast thou to tell thereof unto thy lord belongeth knowledge of the term thereof thou art but warner unto him who feareth it on the day when they behold it it will be as if they had but tarried for an evening or the morn thereof sura abasa he frowned he frowned and turned away because the blind man came unto him what could inform thee but that he might grow in grace or take heed and so the reminder might avail him as for him who thinketh himself independent unto him thou payest regard yet it is not thy concern if he grow not in grace but as for him who cometh unto thee with earnest purpose and hath fear from him thou art distracted nay but verily it is an admonishment so let whosoever will pay heed to it on honoured leaves exalted purified set down by scribes noble and righteous man is self destroyed how ungrateful from what thing doth he create him from drop of seed he createth him and proportioneth him then maketh the way easy for him then causeth him to die and burieth him then when he will he bringeth him again to life nay but man hath not done what he commanded him let man consider his food how we pour water in showers then split the earth in clefts and cause the grain to grow therein and grapes and green fodder and olive trees and palm trees and garden closes of thick foliage and fruits and grasses provision for you and your cattle but when the shout cometh on the day when man fleeth from his brother and his mother and his father and his wife and his children every man that day will have concern enough to make him heedless of others on that day faces will be bright as dawn laughing rejoicing at good news and other faces on that day with dust upon them veiled in darkness those are the disbelievers the wicked sura at takwir the overthrowing when the sun is overthrown and when the stars fall and when the hills are moved and when the camels big with young are abandoned and when the wild beasts are herded together and when the seas rise and when souls are reunited and when the girl child that was buried alive is asked for what sin she was slain and when the pages are laid open and when the sky is torn away and when hell is lighted and when the garden is brought nigh then every soul will know what it hath made ready oh but call to witness the planets the stars which rise and set and the close of night and the breath of morning that this is in truth the word of an honoured messenger mighty established in the presence of the lord of the throne one to be obeyed and trustworthy and your comrade is not mad surely he beheld him on the clear horizon and he is not avid of the unseen nor is this the utterance of devil worthy to be stoned whither then go ye this is naught else than reminder unto creation unto whomsoever of you willeth to walk straight and ye will not unless it be that allah willeth the lord of creation sura al infitar the cleaving bursting apart when the heaven is cleft asunder when the planets are dispersed when the seas are poured forth and the sepulchres are overturned soul will know what it hath sent before it and what left behind man what hath made thee careless concerning thy lord the bountiful who created thee then fashioned then proportioned thee into whatsoever form he will he casteth thee nay but ye deny the judgment lo there are above you guardians generous and recording who know all that ye do lo the righteous verily will be in delight and lo the wicked verily will be in hell they will burn therein on the day of judgment and will not be absent thence ah what will convey unto thee what the day of judgment is again what will convey unto thee what the day of judgment is day on which no soul hath power at all for any other soul the absolute command on that day is allah sura al mutaffifin defrauding the cheats cheating woe unto the defrauders those who when they take the measure from mankind demand it full but if they measure unto them or weight for them they cause them loss do such men not consider that they will be raised again unto an awful day the day when all mankind stand before the lord of the worlds nay but the record of the vile is in sijjin ah what will convey unto thee what sijjin is written record woe unto the repudiators on that day those who deny the day of judgment which none denieth save each criminal transgressor who when thou readest unto him our revelations saith mere fables of the men of old nay but that which they have earned is rust upon their hearts nay but surely on that day they will be covered from the mercy of their lord then lo they verily will burn in hell and it will be said unto them this is that which ye used to deny nay but the record of the righteous is in illiyin ah what will convey unto thee what illiyin is written record attested by those who are brought near unto their lord lo the righteous verily are in delight on couches gazing thou wilt know in their faces the radiance of delight they are given to drink of pure wine sealed whose seal is musk for this let all those strive who strive for bliss and mixed with water of tasnim spring whence those brought near to allah drink lo the guilty used to laugh at those who believed and wink one to another when they passed them and when they returned to their own folk they returned jesting and when they saw them they said lo these have gone astray yet they were not sent as guardians over them this day it is those who believe who have the laugh of disbelievers on high couches gazing are not the disbelievers paid for what they used to do sura al inshiqaq the sundering splitting open when the heaven is split asunder and attentive to her lord in fear and when the earth is spread out and hath cast out all that was in her and is empty and attentive to her lord in fear thou verily man art working toward thy lord work which thou wilt meet in his presence then whoso is given his account in his right hand he truly will receive an easy reckoning and will return unto his folk in joy but whoso is given his account behind his back he surely will invoke destruction and be thrown to scorching fire he verily lived joyous with his folk he verily deemed that he would never return unto allah nay but lo his lord is ever looking on him oh swear by the afterglow of sunset and by the night and all that it enshroudeth and by the moon when she is at the full that ye shall journey on from plane to plane what aileth them then that they believe not and when the qur an is recited unto them worship not allah nay but those who disbelieve will deny and allah knoweth best what they are hiding so give them tidings of painful doom save those who believe and do good works for theirs is reward unfailing sura al burooj the mansions of the stars constellations by the heaven holding mansions of the stars and by the promised day and by the witness

had naught against them save that they believed in allah the mighty the owner of praise him unto whom belongeth the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and allah is of all things the witness lo

when hidden thoughts shall be searched out then will he have no might nor any helper by the heaven which giveth the returning rain and the earth which splitteth with the growth of trees and plants lo this qur an is conclusive word it is no pleasantry lo they plot plot against thee muhammad and plot plot against them so give respite to the disbelievers deal thou gently with them for while sura al ala the most high glory to your lord in the highest praise the name of thy lord the most high who createth then disposeth who measureth then guideth who bringeth forth the pasturage then turneth it to russet stubble we shall make thee read muhammad so that thou shalt not forget save that which allah willeth lo he knoweth the disclosed and that which still is hidden and we shall ease thy way unto the state of ease therefor remind men for of use is the reminder he will heed who feareth but the most hapless will flout it he who will be flung to the great fire wherein he will neither die nor live

created and the heaven how it is raised and the hills how they are set up and the earth how it is spread remind them for thou art but remembrancer thou art not at all warder over them but whoso is averse and disbelieveth allah will punish him with direst punishment lo unto us is their return and ours their reckoning sura al fajr the dawn daybreak by the dawn and ten nights and the even and the odd and the night when it departeth there surely is an oath for thinking man dost thou not consider how thy lord dealt with the tribe of ad with many columned iram the like of which was not created in the lands and with the tribe of thamud who clove the rocks in the valley and with pharaoh firm of might who all were rebellious to allah in these lands and multiplied iniquity therein therefore thy lord poured on them the disaster of his punishment lo thy lord is ever watchful as for man whenever his lord trieth him by honouring him and is gracious unto him he saith my lord honoureth me but whenever he trieth him by straitening his means of life he saith my lord despiseth me nay but ye for your part honour not the orphan and urge not on the feeding of the poor and ye devour heritages with devouring greed and love wealth with abounding love nay but when the earth is ground to atoms grinding grinding and thy lord shall come with angels rank on rank and hell is brought near that day on that day man will remember but how will the remembrance then avail him he will say ah would that had sent before me some provision for my life none punisheth as he will punish on that day none

the ascent ah what will convey unto thee what the ascent is it is to free slave and to feed in the day of hunger an orphan near of kin or some poor wretch in misery and to be of those who believe and exhort one another to perseverance and exhort one another to pity their place will be on the right hand but those who disbelieve our revelations their place will be on the left hand fire will be an awning over them sura ash shams the sun by the sun and his brightness and the moon when she followeth him and the day when it revealeth him and the night when it enshroudeth him and the heaven and him

it to grow and he is indeed failure who stunteth it the tribe of thamud denied the truth in their rebellious pride when the basest of them broke forth and the messenger of allah said it is the she

riches will not save him when he perisheth lo ours it is to give the guidance and lo unto us belong the latter portion and the former therefor have warned you of the flaming fire which only the most wretched must endure he who denieth and turneth away far removed from it will be the righteous who giveth his wealth that he may grow in goodness and none hath with him any favour for reward except as seeking to fulfil the purpose of his lord most high he verily will be content sura ad dhuha the morning hours morning bright by the morning hours and by the night when it is stillest thy lord hath not forsaken thee nor doth he hate thee and verily the latter portion will be better for thee than the former and verily thy lord will give unto thee so that thou wilt be content did he not find thee an orphan and protect thee did he not find thee wandering and direct thee did he not find thee destitute and enrich thee therefor the orphan oppress not therefor the beggar drive not away therefor of the bounty of thy lord be thy discourse sura al inshirah solace consolation relief have we not caused thy bosom to dilate and eased thee of the burden which weighed down thy back and exalted thy fame but

lord is the most bounteous who teacheth by the pen teacheth man that which he knew not nay but verily man is rebellious that he thinketh himself independent lo unto thy lord is the return hast thou seen him who dissuadeth slave when he prayeth hast thou seen if he relieth on the guidance of allah or enjoineth piety hast thou seen if he denieth allah guidance and is froward is he then unaware
