selected mystical works of bahá’u’lláh “at one time we spoke in the language of the lawgiver” bahá’u’lláh writes in the epistle to the son of the wolf “at another in that of the truth seeker and the mystic” the present volume brings together selection of his tablets which were revealed in the language of the mystic some are widely known others are published here for the first time in english translation although most of the tablets in this collection were revealed during bahá’u’lláh’s sojourn in ‘iráq the first the poem known as “rashḥ ‘amá” was written in in the síyáh chál and is among the few he revealed while in his native land of persia and in verse bahá’u’lláh recounts “during the days lay in the prison of ṭihrán though the galling weight of the chains and the stench filled air allowed me but little sleep still in those infrequent moments of slumber felt as if something flowed from the crown of my head over my breast even as mighty torrent that precipitateth itself upon the earth from the summit of lofty mountain every limb of my body would as result be set afire at such moments my tongue recited what no man could bear to hear the poetic reflection of that experience as conveyed in rashḥ ‘amá can perhaps never be adequately rendered into another language yet the present translation is an initial attempt to impart glimpse of its power and momentous themes in ‘iráq during the two years bahá’u’lláh sought seclusion in the mountains of kurdistán far from the malice and dissension that had blighted the bábí community in baghdád word of his presence in sulaymáníyyih attracted religious scholars and mystics of the region including several prominent ṣúfíshaykhs to seek out the one who dwelt as humble dervish yet evinced wisdom that was profound and power of expression unequalled “through his numerous discourses and epistles” shoghi effendi writes “he disclosed new vistas to their eyes resolved the perplexities that agitated their minds unfolded the inner meaning of many hitherto obscure passages in the writings of various commentators poets and theologians ‘in short time is ‘abdu’l‑bahá’s own testimony ‘kurdistán was magnetized with his love during this period bahá’u’lláh lived in poverty his garments were those of the poor and needy his food was that of the indigent and lowly an atmosphere of majesty haloed him as the sun at midday everywhere he was greatly revered and loved when bahá’u’lláh returned to baghdád his kurdish admirers followed the sight of ‘ulamá and ṣúfíshaykhs flocking to visit bahá’u’lláh astonished the religious leaders of the city who also began to seek his presence—and became enthralled their esteem for him in turn attracted others from poets and mystics to government officials and further spread his fame this period shoghi effendi tells us saw an “enormous expansion in the scope and volume of bahá’u’lláh’s writings the verses that streamed during those years from his pen described as ‘a copious rain’ by himself whether in the form of epistles exhortations commentaries apologies dissertations prophecies prayers odes or specific tablets” revivified and transformed the bábí community it was period so prolific that on average the unrecorded verses he would reveal in single day and night equalled in number those of the qur’án “as to those verses which he either dictated or wrote himself their number was no less remarkable than either the wealth of material they contained or the diversity of subjects to which they referred among the “priceless treasures cast forth from the billowing ocean of bahá’u’lláh’s revelation” in those days is bahá’u’lláh’s “greatest mystical composition” the seven valleys which “describes the seven stages which the soul of the seeker must needs traverse ere it can attain the object of its existence writing years later in ‘akká he explained this treatise was revealed in the language of the people in the days prior to our declaration the occasion for its revelation was the receipt of letter addressed to the most holy court in ‘iráq from man of sunní persuasion who was both scholar and mystic this treatise was therefore revealed in accordance with divine wisdom in the manner that was current amongst the people however in this day every soul who hath fixed his gaze upon the supreme horizon and hath recognized the one true god hath verily attained unto every one of the seven valleys or seven stations mentioned therein like the twelfth century poem by ‘aṭṭár manṭiqu’ṭ ṭayr the conference of the birds the seven valleys describes journey through seven stations in quest of the divine however the quest in the seven valleys is also one undertaken in context defined by the imminent dawning of the new revelation—and indeed the presence of the beloved himself that the mystic journey cannot be reduced to fixed scheme nor the search for the divine beloved to series of discrete stages is highlighted in number of other tablets four of which are included here the volume closes with the four valleys an epistle addressed to one of bahá’u’lláh’s devoted admirers from kurdistán rather than describing progression through stages it elaborates four different paths of approach to the divine the current renderings of the seven valleys and the four valleys are based on the translations by marzieh gail in consultation with ali kuli khan published in while those earlier translations contain many exquisite inspired passages some changes were required for clarity and accuracy may the publication of this volume contribute to deeper appreciation of the mystical dimensions of bahá’u’lláh’s message and inspire greater zeal and fervour in raising the celestial call of the divine beloved “for whereas in days past every lover besought and searched after his beloved it is the beloved himself who now is calling his lovers and is inviting them to attain his presence ’tis fromour rapture that the clouds of realms above are raining down ’tis from our anthem that the mysteries of faith are raining down upon the eastern wind cathay’s entrancing musk doth waft this sweetly scented breeze from our curling locks is raining down the day star of adornment hath dawned forth above the face of god behold that mystic truth which from his countenance is raining down the sea of purity hath from the wave of true reunion surged this precious rare bestowal from our rapture is raining down the treasuries of love lay hid within the very heart of fárs from out this treasure trove the pearls of faithfulness are raining down the splendour of the rose doth bring the ecstasy of choicest wine this subtle music from the ringing tones of lordship is raining down the trumpet blast of judgement day the joyful bliss of heaven’s call—both at single breath are from the firmament now raining down the day of “i am he” is made to shine resplendent from our face the age of “he is he” from out our flowing cup is raining down from out the fountain of our heart hath god’s celestial river flowed this cup of honeyed nectar from our ruby lips is raining down the day of god hath been fulfilled for lo the lord hath been unveiled this wondrous message from the melody of ṭá’ is raining down behold bahá’s outpouring grace the bounty of the clouds above which merged into single song in god’s own voice is raining down behold the lord’s leviathan behold his sacred countenance behold the blessings of the heart that from his throne are raining down behold the palm of paradise behold the warbling of the dove behold the glorious hymns that in the purest light are raining down behold the soul entrancing song behold the beating of the drum behold the sacred rhythms that from our hand are raining down behold the countenance divine behold the maid of paradise behold the grace upon the world from our own presence raining down behold the everlasting face behold the chalice bearer’s charm behold the crystal draught that from our brimming cup is raining down behold the fire of moses see his hand that shineth white behold the heart of sinai—from our hand all raining down hear ye the sotted lovers’ sighs behold the garden blooming fair behold the bliss that from his presence in your midst is raining down behold the radiant face of há’ behold the beauteous robe of bá’ behold the lordly grace that from our pen is raining down the vessel of the advent this the clouds of limpid waters these the trill of songbirds this from our fleeting wellspring raining down an exposition of the mysteries enshrined in the stages of ascent for them that seek to journey unto god the almighty the ever forgiving in the name of god the merciful the compassionate praise beto god who hath made being to come forth from nothingness graven upon the tablet of man measure of the mysteries of his eternity taught him from the storehouse of divine utterance that which he knew not made him perspicuous book unto such as have believed and surrendered their souls given him to behold in this dark and ruinous age new creation within all things and caused him to speak forth from the midmost heart of eternity and in new and wondrous voice embodied in the most excellent temple and all to this end that every man may testify in himself and by himself before the seat of the revelation of his lord that there is none other god but him and that all may reach that summit of realities where none shall contemplate anything but that he shall perceive god therein this is the vision of the splendours which have been deposited within the realities of all things for otherwise he exalted be his glory is entirely sanctified above being seen or witnessed “no vision taketh in him but he taketh in all vision he is the subtile the all perceiving and praise and glorify that primal sea which hath branched out from the ocean of the unseen essence and that primal morn which hath broken forth upon the horizon of singleness and that primal sun which hath risen in the heaven of everlasting splendour and that primal fire which was kindled from the lamp of eternity within the niche of oneness he who is called “aḥmad” in the kingdom of the exalted ones and “muḥammad” amongst the concourse of the favoured ones and “maḥmúd” in the realm of the sincere and in the hearts of the knowing “whichsoever ye call upon most beauteous are his names and upon his kindred and his companions be abundant abiding and eternal peace to continue have hearkened to the song of the nightingale of knowledge upon the twigs of the tree of thine inmost being and to the cooing of the dove of certitude upon the branches of the bower of thine heart methinks inhaled the fragrance of purity from the raiment of thy love and in perusing thy letter attained thy very presence noted moreover thine allusions to thy death in god and thy life through him and the love thou dost cherish for the beloved of the lord and for the manifestations of his names and the exponents of his attributes have purposed therefore to acquaint thee with holy and resplendent tokens from the realms of might and glory that haply they may draw thee nigh unto the court of holiness nearness and beauty and draw thee to station wherein thou shalt see naught in all existence but the hallowed countenance of thy beloved and wilt behold all of creation as day wherein none was deemed worthy of mention of this did the nightingale of oneness sing in the garden of his mystical treatise saying “and there shall appear upon the tablet of thine heart an inscription of the subtle mysteries of the verse ‘fear ye god god will teach you’ and the bird of thy spirit shall recall the sanctuaries of ancient splendour and soar upon the wings of longing into the heaven of the command ‘walk the beaten paths of thy lord’ and partake of the choice fruits of communion in the gardens of the utterance ‘feed moreover on every kind of fruit ’” by my life friend wert thou to taste the fruits of these verdant trees that spring from the soil of true understanding once the effulgent light of his essence hath been reflected in the mirrors of his names and attributes yearning would seize the reins of patience and restraint from out thy hand and stir thy spirit into commotion with the splendours of his light it would draw thee from this abode of dust unto thy true and heavenly habitation in the midmost heart of mystic knowledge and raise thee to station wherein thou wilt soar in the air even as thou treadest upon the earth and wilt walk upon the water even as thou movest over the land wherefore may it rejoice me and thee and whosoever mounteth into the heaven of knowledge and whose heart hath been revived by the breezes of certitude that waft from the sheba of the all merciful upon the meadow of his inner being peace be upon him who followeth the way of guidance and further the stages that mark the wayfarers’ journey from their mortal abode to the heavenly homeland are said to be seven some have referred to them as seven valleys and others as seven cities and it is said that until the wayfarer taketh leave of self and traverseth these stages he shall never attain the ocean of nearness and reunion nor taste of the matchless wine the first isthe valley of search the steed of this valley is patience without patience the wayfarer on this journey will reach nowhere and attain no goal nor should he ever become downhearted if he strive for hundred thousand years and yet fail to behold the beauty of the friend he should not falter for those who seek the kaaba of “for us” rejoice in the tidings “in our ways shall we assuredly guide them in their search they have stoutly girded up the loins of service and at every moment journey from the plane of heedlessness into the realm of search no bond shall hold them back and no counsel deter them it is incumbent upon these servants to cleanse the heart which is the wellspring of divine treasures of every marking turn away from imitation which is following the traces of their forefathers and shut the door of friendship and enmity upon all the people of the earth in this journey the seeker reacheth station wherein he seeth all created things wandering distracted in search of the friend how many jacob will he see searching after his joseph how many lover will he behold hastening towards the well beloved world of adoring souls will he witness tracing the path of the adored one at every moment he findeth weighty matter in every hour he becometh aware of new mystery for he hath severed his heart from both worlds and set out for the kaaba of the beloved at every step aid from the invisible realm will attend him and the fervour of his search will grow one must judge of search by the standard of the majnún of love it is related that one day they came upon majnún sifting the dust his tears flowing down they asked “what doest thou he said “i seek for laylí “alas for thee they cried “laylí is of pure spirit yet thou seekest her in the dust he said “i seek her everywhere haply somewhere shall find her yea though to the wise it be shameful to seek the lord of lords in the dust yet this betokeneth intense ardour in searching “whoso seeketh out thing and persisteth with zeal shall find it the true seeker hunteth naught but the object of his quest and the sincere lover hath no desire save reunion with his beloved nor shall the seeker reach his goal unless he sacrifice all things that is whatever he hath seen and heard and understood—all he must set at naught with “no god is there” that he may enter into the realm of the spirit which is the city of “but god” labour is needed if we are to seek him ardour is needed if we are to drink the nectar of reunion with him and if we taste of this cup we shall cast away the world on this journey the wayfarer dwelleth in every abode however humble and resideth in every land in every face he seeketh the beauty of the friend in every region he searcheth after the beloved he joineth every company and seeketh fellowship with every soul that haply in some heart he may discern the secret of the beloved or in some face behold the beauty of the adored one and if by the help of the creator he findeth on this journey trace of the traceless friend and inhaleth the fragrance of the long lost joseph from the heavenly herald he shall straightway step intothe valley of loveand be consumed in the fire of love in this city the heaven of rapture is upraised and the world illuming sun of yearning shineth and the fire of love is set ablaze and when the fire of love is ablaze it burneth to ashes the harvest of reason now is the wayfarer oblivious of himself and of aught besides himself he seeth neither ignorance nor knowledge neither doubt nor certitude he knoweth not the morn of guidance from the night of error he fleeth from both unbelief and faith and findeth in deadly poison his heart’s relief wherefore ‘aṭṭár saith for the infidel error—for the faithful faith for ‘aṭṭár’s heart an atom of thy pain the steed of this valley is pain and if there be no pain this journey will never end in this plane the lover hath no thought save the beloved and seeketh no refuge save the friend at every moment he offereth hundred lives in the path of the loved one at every step he throweth thousand heads at his feet my brother until thou enter the egypt of love thou shalt never gaze upon the joseph like beauty of the friend and until like jacob thou forsake thine outward eyes thou shalt never open the eye of thine inward being and until thou burn with the fire of love thou shalt never find thyself in true yearning’s embrace lover feareth nothing and can suffer no harm thou seest him chill in the fire and dry in the sea lover is he who is chill in hellfire knower is he who is dry in the sea love accepteth no existence and wisheth no life in death it seeth life and in shame it seeketh glory to merit the madness of love one must abound in sanity to merit the bonds of the friend one must be free in spirit blessed the neck that is caught in his noose and happy the head that falleth on the dust in the path of his love wherefore friend renounce thy self that thou mayest find the peerless one and soar beyond this mortal world that thou mayest find thy nest in the abode of heaven be as naught if thou wouldst kindle the fire of being and be fit for the pathway of love ne’er will love allow living soul to tread its way ne’er will the falcon deign to seize lifeless prey love setteth world aflame at every turn and layeth waste every land wherein it raiseth its banner being hath no existence in its kingdom the wise wield no command within its realm the leviathan of love swalloweth the master of reason and slayeth the lord of knowledge it drinketh the seven seas but its heart’s thirst is still unquenched and it asketh “is there yet any more it shunneth its own self and draweth away from all on earth love shunneth this world and that world too in him are lunacies seventy and two love hath bound myriad victims in its fetters and pierced myriad wise men with its arrow know that every redness thou seest in the world is from its wrath and every paleness in men’s cheeks is from its poison it yieldeth no remedy but death and walketh not save in the valley of extinction yet sweeter than honey is its venom upon the lover’s lips and fairer its deadly sting in the seeker’s sight than hundred thousand lives wherefore must the veils of the satanic self be burned away in the fire of love that the spirit may be cleansed and refined and thus may apprehend the station of him but for whom the world would not have been created kindle the fire of love and burn away all things then set thy foot into the land of the lovers and if confirmed by the creator the lover escapeth the claws of the eagle of love he will enterthe realm of knowledgeand come out of doubt into certitude and turn from the darkness of wayward desire to the guiding light of the fear of god his inner eye will open and he will privily converse with his beloved he will unlock the gates of truth and supplication and shut the doors of idle fancy he in this realm is content with the divine decree and seeth war as peace and in death findeth the meaning of everlasting life with both inward and outward eyes he witnesseth the mysteries of resurrection in the realms of creation and in the souls of men and with spiritual heart apprehendeth the wisdom of god in his endless manifestations in the sea he findeth drop in drop he beholdeth the secrets of the sea split the atom’s heart and lo within it thou wilt find sun gazing with the eye of absolute insight the wayfarer in this valley seeth in god’s creation neither contradiction nor incongruity and at every moment exclaimeth “no defect canst thou see in the creation of the god of mercy repeat the gaze seest thou single flaw he beholdeth justice in injustice and in justice grace in ignorance he findeth many knowledge hidden and in knowledge myriad wisdoms manifest he breaketh the cage of the body and the hold of the passions and communeth with the denizens of the immortal realm he scaleth the ladders of inner truth and hasteneth to the heaven of inner meanings he rideth in the ark of “we will surely show them our signs in the world and within themselves” and saileth upon the sea of “until it become plain to them that it is the truth” and if he meeteth with injustice he shall have patience and if he cometh upon wrath he shall manifest love there was once lover it is said who had sighed for long years in separation from his beloved and wasted in the fire of remoteness from the rule of love his breast was void of patience and his body weary of his spirit he reckoned life without her as mockery and the world consumed him away how many day he found no respite from his longing how many night the pain of her kept him from sleep his body was worn to sigh and his heart’s wound had turned him to cry of sorrow thousand lives would he freely have given for one taste of the cup of her presence and yet even this was not within his reach the doctors knew no cure for him and companions avoided his company yea physicians have no remedy for one sick of love unless the favour of the beloved deliver him at last the tree of his longing yielded the fruit of despair and the fire of his hope fell to ashes then one night he could bear life no more and he left his house for the marketplace on sudden watchman followed after him he broke into run with the watchman in swift pursuit then other watchmen came together and barred every passage to the weary one and that wretched one cried from his heart and ran here and there and moaned to himself “surely this watchman is ‘izrá’íl my angel of death following so fast upon me or he is tyrant of men prompted by hatred and malice his feet carried him on—that hapless one bleeding with the arrow of love—while his heart lamented then he came to garden wall and with untold pain and trouble he scaled it he saw that it was very high yet forgetting his life he threw himself down into the garden and there he beheld his beloved with lamp in her hand searching for ring she had lost when the heart surrendered lover looked upon his ravishing love he drew great breath and lifted his hands in prayer crying “o god bestow honour upon the watchman and riches and long life for the watchman was gabriel guiding this poor one or he was isráfíl bringing life to this wretched one indeed his words were true for he had found many secret justice in this seeming tyranny of the watchman and had seen how many mercy lay hid behind the veil in one stroke of wrath the guard had joined one who was athirst in the desert of love to the sea of the beloved and dispelled the darkness of separation with the shining light of reunion he had led one who was afar to the garden of nearness and guided an ailing soul to the heart’s physician now if the lover could have seen the end he would from the beginning have blessed the watchman prayed god on his behalf and seen his tyranny as justice but since the end was veiled to him he lamented and made his plaint in the beginning yet those who journey in the garden land of true knowledge since they see the end in the beginning behold peace in war and conciliation in enmity such is the state of the wayfarers in this valley but the people of the valleys above this see the end and the beginning as one nay they see neither “beginning” nor “end” and witness neither “first” nor “last” nay rather the denizens of the city of immortality who dwell in the celestial garden see not even “neither first nor last” they fly from all that is first and repulse all that is last for these have passed over the worlds of names and swift as lightning fled beyond the worlds of attributes thus is it said “the perfection of belief in divine unity is to deny him any attributes and they have made their dwelling place in the shadow of the divine essence whereforekhájih ‘abdu’lláh —may god the most high sanctify his blessed soul—hath made in this connection subtle point and spoken an eloquent word as to the meaning of “guide thou us on the straight path” which is “show us the right way that is honour us with the love of thine essence that we may be freed from occupation with ourselves and aught else save thee and may become wholly thine that we may know only thee and see only thee and think of none save thee nay they would even soar above this station as it is said “love is veil betwixt the lover and beloved “more than this am not permitted to tell at this hour the morn of true knowledge hath dawned and the lamps of wayfaring and wandering have been quenched veiled from this was moses too despite his virtue and his light then thou who hast no wings at all abandon any hope of flight if thou be man of communion and prayer soar upon the wings of assistance from the holy ones that thou mayest behold the mysteries of the friend and attain the lights of the beloved “verily we are god’s and to him shall we return after passing through the valley of knowledge which is the last station of limitation the wayfarer cometh tothe first station of unityand drinketh from the cup of oneness and gazeth upon the manifestations of singleness in this station he pierceth the veils of plurality fleeth the realms of the flesh and ascendeth unto the heaven of unity with the ear of god he heareth with the eye of god he beholdeth the mysteries of divine creation he steppeth into the inner sanctuary of the friend and as an intimate shareth the pavilion of the well beloved he stretcheth forth the hand of truth from the sleeve of the absolute and revealeth the mysteries of divine power he seeth in himself neither name nor fame nor rank but findeth his own praise in the praise of god and in the name of god beholdeth his own to him “all songs are from that sovereign king” and every melody from him he sitteth on the throne of “say all things are of god” and reclineth upon the seat of “there is no power nor strength but in god alone he looketh upon all things with the eye of unity and seeth the effulgent rays of the sun of truth shining from the dayspring of the divine essence upon all created things alike and beholdeth the lights of unity reflected upon all creation it is known to thine eminence that all the variations which the wayfarer in the stages of his journey beholdeth in the realms of being proceed from his own vision we shall give an example of this that the meaning may become fully clear consider the visible sun although it shineth with the same radiance upon all existence and at the behest of the lord of revelation bestoweth light on all things yet in each place it becometh manifest and sheddeth its bounty according to the potentialities of that place for instance in mirror it reflecteth its own disk and shape and this is due to the clarity of the mirror itself through crystal it maketh fire to appear and in other things it showeth only the effect of its shining but not its full disk and yet through that effect by the command of the creator it traineth each thing according to the capacity of that thing even as thou dost observe in like manner colours become visible in each object according to its nature for instance in yellow glass the rays shine yellow in white glass they are white and in red glass red rays are visible these variations proceed from the object itself not from the light and if place be shut away from the light as by walls and roof it will be entirely bereft of the light of the sun and deprived of its rays thus it is that certain feeble souls have confined the wide expanse of knowledge within the walls of self and passion and beneath the cloak of ignorance and blindness and have thereby veiled themselves from the light of the mystic sun and the mysteries of the eternal beloved they have strayed far from the gem like wisdom of the resplendent faith of the lord of the messengers have been shut out of the inner court of the all beauteous and have been banished from the kaaba of glory such is the worth of the people of this age and if nightingale soar beyond the clay of self and dwell in the rose bower of the heart and in arabian melodies and sweet persian tones recount the mysteries of god—a single word whereof quickeneth anew every lifeless form and bestoweth the spirit of holiness upon every mouldering bone—thou wilt behold thousand claws of envy and myriad talons of hatred hunting after him and striving with all their power to encompass his death yea to the beetle sweet fragrance seemeth foul and to the man sick of rheum pleasant perfume availeth naught wherefore hath it been said for the guidance of the ignorant cleanse thou the rheum from out thine headand breathe the breath of god instead in sum the differences among objects have now been made plain thus when the wayfarer gazeth only upon the place of appearance—that is when he considereth only the glass—he seeth yellow and red and white and so it is that conflict hath prevailed amongst men and darksome dust from limited souls hath settled over the world others gaze upon the effulgence of the light while yet others have drunk of the wine of oneness and see naught but the sun itself as the wayfarers traverse these three differing planes their understanding and their words differ accordingly and hence the sign of conflict hath ever appeared on earth for there are some who dwell on the plane of divine unity and speak of that world and some inhabit the realms of limitation and some the grades of self while others are completely veiled thus do the ignorant people of the day who have no share of the radiance of the divine beauty make certain claims and in every age and cycle inflict upon the people of the ocean of divine unity what they themselves deserve “if god should chastise men for their perverse doings he would not leave upon the earth moving thing but to an appointed time doth he respite them my brother pure heart is as mirror cleanse it with the burnish of love and severance from all save god that the true sun may shine therein and the eternal morning dawn then wilt thou clearly see the meaning of “earth and heaven cannot contain me what can alone contain me is the heart of him that believeth in me and thou wilt take up thy life in thy hand and with infinite longing cast it before thy newly found beloved whensoever the light of the revelation of the king of oneness settleth upon the throne of the heart and soul his radiance becometh visible in every limb and member at that time the mystery of the famed tradition gleameth out of the darkness “a servant is drawn unto me in prayer until answer him and when have answered him become the ear wherewith he heareth …” for thus the master of the house hath appeared within his home and all the pillars of the dwelling are ashine with his light and as the action and effect of the light are from the light giver so it is that all move through him and arise by his will this is that wellspring whereof the near ones drink as it is said “a fount whereof they who draw nigh to god shall drink” however let none construe these utterances to imply the incarnation or descent of the worlds of god into the grades of his creatures nor should they lead thine eminence to such misapprehensions for god in his essence is sanctified above all ascent and descent egress and regress he hath through all eternity been exalted beyond the attributes of his creation and will ever remain so no man hath ever known him no soul hath ever fathomed the nature of his being in the valley of his knowledge every mystic wandereth astray in the comprehension of his essence every saint standeth bewildered sanctified is he above the understanding of the wise exalted is he beyond the knowledge of the knowing “the way is barred and all seeking rejected his proof is his signs his evidence his being wherefore the lovers of the countenance of the beloved have said “o thou whose essence alone can lead to his essence and who transcendeth all likeness to his creatures” how can utter nothingness spur its charger in the arena of eternity or fleeting shadow reach to the everlasting sun the friend addressed by the words “but for thee” hath said “we have failed to know thee” and the beloved alluded to by the words “or even closer” hath said “nor attained thy presence” indeed the references that have been made to the degrees of mystic knowledge pertain to the knowledge of the effulgences of that sun of truth as it becometh reflected in various mirrors and the effulgence of that light is present within the hearts yet it is hidden beneath the veils of selfish desires and earthly attachments even as candle within lantern of iron and only when the cover is lifted doth the light of the candle shine out in like manner when thou dost strip the veils of illusion from the face of thine heart the lights of oneness will be made manifest it is clear then that even these rays are not subject to egress or regress—how much less that essence of existence and longed for mystery my brother consider these matters in the spirit of enquiry not in blind imitation true wayfarer will not be deterred by the impediment of words nor daunted by the sway of insinuations how can curtain part the lover from his love when alexander’s wall cannot keep them apart secrets are many and strangers are myriad volumes will not suffice to hold the mystery of the beloved nor can it be exhausted in these pages though it be no more than word no more than sign “knowledge is one point which the foolish have multiplied infer then from this the differences among the worlds though the worlds of god be infinite yet some refer to them as four the world of time which hath both beginning and an end the world of duration which hath beginning but whose end is not apparent the world of primordial reality whose beginning is not to be seen but which is known to have an end and the world of eternity of which neither the beginning nor the end is visible although there are many differing statements as to these points to recount them in detail would result in weariness thus some have said that the world of primordial reality hath neither beginning nor end and have equated the world of eternity with the invisible inaccessible and unknowable essence others have called these the worlds of the heavenly court of the celestial dominion of the divine kingdom and of mortal existence moreover the journeys in the pathway of love have been reckoned as four from the creatures to the true one from the true one to the creatures from the creatures to the creatures and from the true one to the true one there is many an utterance of the sages and mystics of former times which have not mentioned here since mislike copious citation from the sayings of the past for quotation from the words of others betokeneth acquired learning and not divine bestowal even so much as have quoted here is out of deference to the wont of men and after the manner of the learned further such matters are beyond the scope of this epistle my unwillingness to recount their sayings is not from pride rather it is the manifestation of wisdom and the revelation of bounty ifkhiḍr did wreck the vessel on the sea thousand rights are in this wrong concealed otherwise this servant regardeth himself as utterly lost and non existent even before one of the beloved of god how much less in the presence of his holy ones glorified be my lord the most high moreover our aim is to recount the stages of the wayfarer’s journey not to set forth the conflicting utterances of the mystics although brief example hath been given concerning the beginning and ending of the relative and contingent world yet further illustration is now provided that the full meaning may become clear for instance let thine eminence consider his own self thou art first in relation to thy son and last in relation to thy father in thine outward appearance thou tellest of the appearance of power in the realms of divine creation in thine inward being thou revealest the hidden mysteries which are the divine trust deposited within thee and thus firstness and lastness outwardness and inwardness are in the sense referred to all true of thyself so that in these four states conferred upon thee thou mayest comprehend the four divine states and that the nightingale of thine heart warbling on all the flowering branches of the tree of existence whether seen or unseen might cry out “he is the first and the last the seen and the hidden these statements are made in the sphere of that which is relative otherwise those souls who with but one step have traversed the world of the relative and the conditioned and dwelt in the court of independent sovereignty and pitched their tent in the realms of absolute authority and command have burned away these relativities with single spark and blotted out these words with mere dewdrop and they swim in the sea of the spirit and soar in the holy atmosphere of light then what existence have words on such plane that “first” and “last” or other than these should be mentioned or described in this realm the first is the same as the last and the last is the same as the first in thy soul of love build thou fireand burn all thoughts and words entire my friend look to thyself hadst thou not become father and begotten son neither wouldst thou have comprehended these words now forget them one and all that thou mayest learn from the master of love in the schoolhouse of divine unity mayest return unto god forsake the land of unreality for thy true station and dwell beneath the shadow of the tree of knowledge thou dear one impoverish thyself that thou mayest enter the lofty court of riches and humble thy body that thou mayest drink from the stream of glory and attain to the full meaning of the poems whereof thou hadst asked thus it hath been made clear that these stages depend on the attainment of the wayfarer in every city he will behold world in every valley reach spring in every meadow hear song but the falcon of the mystic heaven hath many wondrous carol of the spirit in its breast and the persian bird keepeth in its soul many sweet arabian melody yet these are hidden and hidden shall remain if speak forth many mind will shatter and if write many pen will break peace be upon him who concludeth this exalted journey and followeth the way of truth by the lights of guidance the wayfarer after traversing the high planes of this supernal journey entereth intothe city of contentment in this valley he feeleth the breezes of divine contentment blowing from the plane of the spirit he burneth away the veils of want and with inward and outward eye perceiveth within and without all things the day of “god will satisfy everyone out of his abundance from sorrow he turneth to bliss and from grief to joy and from anguish and dejection to delight and rapture although to outward seeming the wayfarers in this valley may dwell upon the dust yet inwardly they are throned in the heights of mystic meaning they partake of the eternal bounties of heaven and drink of the delicate wines of the spirit the tongue faileth in describing these three valleys and speech falleth short the pen steppeth not into this arena the ink leaveth only blot in these stations the nightingale of the heart hath other songs and secrets which make the heart to leap and the soul to cry out but this mystery of inner meaning may be whispered only from heart to heart and confided only from breast to breast the bliss of mystic knowers can be only told from heart to heart bliss no messenger can bear and no missive dare impart how many are the matters have out of weakness left unsaid for my words would fail to reckon them and mine every effort would fall short friend till thou enter the garden of these inner meanings thou shalt never taste of the imperishable wine of this valley and shouldst thou taste of it thou wilt turn away from all else and drink of the cup of contentment thou wilt loose thyself from all things and bind thyself unto him and lay down thy life in his path and offer up thy soul for his sake and this even though in this realm there is no “all else” that thou needst forget “god was alone there was none else besides him for on this plane the traveller witnesseth the beauty of the friend in all things in fire he seeth the face of the beloved in illusion he beholdeth the secret of reality in the attributes he readeth the riddle of the essence for he hath burnt away all veils with sigh and cast aside all coverings with glance with piercing sight he gazeth upon the new creation and with lucid heart he graspeth subtle verities the words “and we have made thy sight sharp in this day” are sufficient proof of this assertion and befitting description of this state after journeying through the planes of pure contentment the traveller cometh tothe valley of wondermentand is tossed upon the oceans of grandeur and at every moment his wonder increaseth now he seeth the embodiment of wealth as poverty itself and the essence of independence as sheer impotence now is he struck dumb with the beauty of the all glorious again is he wearied out with his own life how many mystic tree hath this whirlwind of bewilderment snatched by the roots how many soul hath it worn out and exhausted for in this valley the traveller is flung into confusion albeit in the eyes of him who hath attained such signs are esteemed and well beloved at every moment he beholdeth wondrous world and new creation and goeth from astonishment to astonishment and is lost in awe before the new handiwork of him who is the sovereign lord of all indeed brother if we ponder each created thing we shall witness myriad consummate wisdoms and learn myriad new and wondrous truths one of the created phenomena is the dream behold how many secrets have been deposited therein how many wisdoms treasured up how many worlds concealed observe how thou art asleep in dwelling and its doors are shut on sudden thou findest thyself in far off city which thou enterest without moving thy feet or wearying thy body without taxing thine eyes thou seest without troubling thine ears thou hearest without tongue thou speakest and perchance when ten years have passed thou wilt witness in this temporal world the very things thou hast dreamt tonight now there are many wisdoms to ponder in the dream which none but the people of this valley can comprehend in their reality first what is this world where without eye or ear or hand or tongue one can put all these to use second how is it that in the outer world thou seest today the effect of dream which thou didst witness in the world of sleep some ten years past consider the difference between these two worlds and the mysteries they conceal that attended by divine confirmations thou mayest attain unto heavenly discoveries and enter the realms of holiness god the most high hath placed these signs in men so that veiled minds might not deny the mysteries of the life beyond nor belittle that which hath been promised them for some hold fast to reason and deny whatever reason comprehendeth not and yet feeble minds can never grasp the reality of the stages that we have related the universal divine intellect alone can comprehend them how can feeble reason embrace the qur’ánor the spider snare phoenix in its web all these states are to be found and witnessed in the valley of wonderment wherein the wayfarer at every moment seeketh for more and is not wearied thus the lord of the first and the last in setting forth the grades of contemplation and expressing bewilderment hath said “increase my wonder and amazement at thee god likewise reflect upon the perfection of man’s creation and that all these planes and states are folded up and hidden away within him dost thou deem thyself small and puny form when thou foldest within thyself the greater world we must therefore labour to destroy the animal condition till the meaning of humanity cometh to light likewise luqmán who had drunk from the wellspring of wisdom and tasted of the waters of mercy in proving to his son nathan the planes of resurrection and death advanced the dream as evidence and example we relate it here that through this evanescent servant memory may endure of that youth of the school of divine unity that elder of the realms of instruction and detachment he said “o son if thou art able not to sleep then thou art able not to die and if thou art able not to waken after sleep then thou shalt be able not to rise after death friend the heart is the dwelling place of eternal mysteries make it not the home of fleeting fancies waste not the treasure of thy precious life occupied with this swiftly passing world thou comest from the world of holiness bind not thine heart to the earth thou art dweller in the court of reunion choose not the homeland of the dust in sum there is no end to the description of these stages but because of the wrongs inflicted by the peoples of this age this servant is disinclined to continue the tale remaineth yet unfinished and untold forgive me then for weariness hath taken hold the pen groaneth and the ink sheddeth tears and the river of the heart surgeth in waves of blood “nothing can befall us but what god hath destined for us peace be upon him who followeth the way of guidance after scaling the high summits of wonderment the wayfarer cometh tothe valley of true poverty and absolute nothingness this station is that of dying to the self and living in god of being poor in self and rich in the desired one poverty as here referred to signifieth being poor in that which pertaineth to the world of creation and rich in what belongeth to the realms of god for when the true lover and devoted friend reacheth the presence of the beloved the radiant beauty of the loved one and the fire of the lover’s heart will kindle blaze and burn away all veils and wrappings yea all that he hath from marrow to skin will be set aflame so that nothing will remain save the friend when once shone forth the attributesof him who is the ancient king all mention moses burned awayof every fleeting transient thing whoso hath attained this station is sanctified from all that pertaineth to the world wherefore if those who have reached the ocean of his presence are found to possess none of the limited things of this perishable world whether earthly riches or worldly opinions it mattereth not for that which is with his creatures is circumscribed by their own limitations whereas that which is with god is sanctified therefrom this utterance must be deeply pondered that its purport may be clear “verily the righteous shall drink of cup tempered at the camphor fountain if the true meaning of “camphor” become known our true intent will become evident this station is that poverty of which it is said “poverty is my glory and of inward and outward poverty there is many stage and many meaning which have not thought pertinent to mention here hence have reserved these for another time dependent on what god may desire and fate may seal this is the station wherein the multiplicity of all things perisheth in the wayfarer and the divine countenance dawning above the horizon of eternity riseth out of the darkness and the meaning of “all on the earth shall pass away but the face of thy lord” is made manifest my friend listen with heart and soul to the songs of the spirit and treasure them as thine own eyes for heavenly wisdoms even as vernal showers will not rain forever upon the earth of men’s hearts and though the grace of the all bounteous one is never ceasing and never stilled yet to every time and era portion is allotted and bounty assigned which is vouchsafed in given measure “and no one thing is there but with us are its storehouses and we send it not down but in settled measure indeed the clouds of the loved one’s mercy rain only on the garden of the spirit and bestow this bounty only in the season of spring other seasons have no share in this supernal grace and barren lands hold no portion of this bounteous favour my brother not every sea hath pearls not every branch will flower nor will the nightingale sing thereon then ere the nightingale of the mystic paradise repair to the celestial garden and the rays of the morn of inner meaning return to the day star of truth make thou an effort that haply in this dust heap of mortal world thou mayest catch fragrance from the everlasting rose garden and live in the shadow of the inhabitants of this everlasting city and when thou hast attained this highest plane and most exalted degree then shalt thou gaze on the beloved and forget all else the friend unveiled doth shed the splendour of his lightthrough every door and wall ye endued with sight thou hast given up the drop of life and drawn nigh unto the ocean of the well beloved this is the goal thou didst seek god grant thou mayest attain thereunto in this city even the veils of light are rent asunder and vanish away “his beauty hath no veiling save light his countenance no covering save revelation how strange that the beloved is as visible as the sun and yet the heedless still hunt after tinsel and base metal yea the intensity of his revelation hath veiled him and the fullness of his shining forth hath hidden him even as the noontide sunhath the true one brightly shined but alas that he hath cometo the city of the blind in this valley the wayfarer passeth beyond the stages of the “unity of existence” and the “unity of appearance” and reacheth unity that is sanctified above both of these stations ecstasy alone can encompass this theme not utterance nor argument and whosoever hath dwelt at this stage of the journey or caught breath from this garden knoweth whereof we speak in all these journeys the wayfarer must stray not hair’s breadth from the law for this is indeed the secret of the path and the fruit of the tree of truth and in all these stages he must cling to the robe of obedience to all that hath been enjoined and hold fast to the cord of shunning all that is forbidden that he may partake of the cup of the law and be informed of the mysteries of truth if any of the utterances of this servant be not understood or lead to perplexity the same must be enquired of again that no doubt may linger and that the meaning may shine as resplendent as the face of the beloved dawning from his “glorious station” these journeys have no visible ending in this temporal world but the detached wayfarer—should invisible confirmation descend upon him and the guardian of the cause assist him—may traverse these seven stages in seven steps nay rather in seven breaths nay even in single breath should god will and desire it this is “a token of his grace vouchsafed unto whomsoever he pleaseth they who soar in the heaven of divine unity and attain the depths of the sea of detachment reckon this city—which is the station of life in god—as the loftiest state of the mystic knowers and the furthermost homeland of the faithful lovers but to this evanescent one of the mystic ocean this station is the first gate of the heart’s citadel that is man’s first entrance to the city of the heart and the heart is endowed with four stages which would be recounted should kindred soul be found shattered was the pen at once rent and torn in twain the page when the pen did reach the pointof depicting such stage my friend many hound hunteth this gazelle of the desert of oneness many an eagle pursueth this nightingale of the garden of eternity ravens of hatred lie in wait for this bird of the heavens of god and the huntsman of envy stalketh this deer of the meadow of love oshaykh make of thine effort glass that perchance it may shelter this flame from contrary winds albeit this flame doth long to be kindled in the lamp of the lord and to shine in the niche of the spirit for the head that is raised up in the love of god will assuredly fall by the sword and the life that is aflame with longing will assuredly be extinguished and the heart that cleaveth to the remembrance of the beloved will assuredly break how well hath it been said live free of love for its peaceis grief and sorrow at each breath it starteth but with ache and pain it endeth but with loss and death peace be upon him who followeth the way of guidance the novel thoughts thou hast expressed as to the symbolism contained in the word “sparrow” were considered thou appearest to be well grounded in mystic truth however in each realm to every letter meaning is allotted which pertaineth to that realm indeed the wayfarer findeth secret in every name and mystery in every letter in one sense these letters refer to the states of holiness the first meaneth “free thyself from the promptings of self then approach thy lord the second meaneth “purify thyself from all save him that thou mayest offer up thy life for his sake the third meaneth “draw back from the threshold of the one true god if thou art still possessed of earthly attributes the fourth meaneth “render thanks unto thy lord on his earth that he may bless thee in his heaven albeit in the realm of his unity his heaven is the same as his earth the fifth meaneth “remove from thine eyes the veils of limitation that thou mayest learn that which thou knewest not of the stations of holiness wert thou to hearken unto the melodies of this mortal bird then wouldst thou seek out the eternal and undying chalice and renounce every fleeting and perishable cup peace be upon him who followeth the way of guidance in the name of our lord the most exalted the most high addressed unto theeaforetime an epistle in the lucid arabian tongue and now reveal for thee this tablet in wondrous persian prose that thou mayest hear in the glorious accents of the nightingale of ‘iráq the sweet melodies of the nearness of the heavenly paradise that had ere this been intoned in the language of ḥijáz perchance thou mayest become pure spirit attain without taking single step the loftiest stations of mystic ascent and explore without leaving thine outward habitation the furthermost reaches of the worlds of inner significance thereupon wouldst thou with divine rapture experience true spiritual attraction lay down thy life in the path of the friend and sacrifice thy soul in the wilderness of his love this indeed is the meaning of stillness in flight and flight in stillness of fluidity in solidity and solidity in fluidity to continue it is clear that the wayfarers in the wilderness of search and longing of attainment and reunion have numerous degrees and countless stations some after spiritual struggle and physical toil ascend from the lower reaches of “no god is there” to the lofty bowers of “but god” flee from the shadow of negation to abide in the limitless realm of affirmation and abandon the privation of transient existence for the bountiful assemblage of reunion this is the uttermost limit of the realm of effort and striving others without receiving the least intimation of “no god is there” pass beyond the highest horizon of “but god” without even tasting dewdrop of the degrees of self surrender ascend unto the kingdom of life everlasting and without partaking from the wellspring of utter abnegation quaff the wine of the ancient of days these souls as they traverse the stages of wayfaring and ascend unto the stations of reunion walk different path and occupy different rank still others without having perused single letter of the kingdom of names or acquired the faintest intimation from the realm of attributes which pertaineth to this world dawn above the invisible horizon of eternity and return again thereunto hundred thousand seas of glory surge in their luminous hearts and yet to outward seeming their lips are parched myriad rivers of holiness stream within their breasts and yet no trace thereof is to be seen the books of god’s consummate wisdom are recorded upon the tablets of their hearts and yet they breathe not word thereof in the world of appearances they dwell in the egypt of certitude and journey in the lands of resignation they are intoxicated with the beauty and entranced by the glory of him who is the all glorious heart to heart they whisper hidden secrets soul to soul they unfold abstruse matters the mysteries of the divine essence glow upon their brows and the lights of divine unity shine from their peerless faces they clothe themselves in the robe of concealment and cast their sleeves over both this world and the world to come without wings they soar without feet they walk without hands they grasp and hold they speak an unknown tongue and observe an unseen grammar of which all the world’s inhabitants know not single letter save those whom thy lord hath willed unto each hath share been vouchsafed in his book and they shall all attain unto that which hath been destined for them it is clear and evident that in this dispensation wherein the banner of utterance hath been raised aloft and the candle of discernment hath been lit there is no lord but the exalted one he it is who is one in his essence and one in his attributes single in the kingdom of names and peerless in the realm of actions it is by virtue of his blessed name that the seas of divine unity have been made to surge it is through the power of his resistless command that the immutable decrees of destiny have been enforced it is through the potency of his sovereign might that the dictates of fate have been fixed who hath the power to soar in that exalted atmosphere or to cherish another beloved than him we all abide beneath his shadow and seek our portion from the ocean of his grace however far the gnat may fly it can never traverse the length and breadth of heaven and however high the sparrow may soar it can never attain the tree of immortality but since all do not possess the same degree of spiritual understanding certain statements will inevitably be made and there shall arise as consequence as many differing opinions as there are human minds and as many divergent beliefs as there are created things this is certain and settled and can in no wise be averted now it is clear that some are virtuous others are sinful and still others are rebellious one must call the people to love and faithfulness to zeal and contentment that the sinful may be admonished and the ranks of the virtuous may swell nor is it possible that there be no sinners so long as the name “the ever forgiving” shineth resplendent above the horizon of existence there will be sinners in the world of creation for the latter cannot appear without the former and the former cannot exist without the latter our aim is that thou shouldst urge all the believers to show forth kindness and mercy and to overlook certain shortcomings among them that differences may be dispelled true harmony be established and the censure and reproach the hatred and dissension seen among the peoples of former times may not arise anew perchance they may be educated and in the latter resurrection inflict not upon that cherished spirit and essence of existence that exalted and subtle reality the least of that which the point of the bayán was made to suffer moreover reply to thine enquiries was sent aforetime it is evident that whatever question is asked will be answered through the ocean of eternal grace but such questions also add to the burden of duties imposed upon the servants that which hath been recorded at god’s behest in the persian bayán is indeed sufficient unto all and none will be held to account for what it hath not commanded consider how numerous were those in the early days of the revelation who obeyed without the slightest deviation every least one of its injunctions and yet reaped no benefit therefrom the beginning of religion is love for god and for his chosen ones and its end is to manifest that love to his servants swear by god whoso faileth to obey the commandments of god can in no wise be numbered among his loved ones for among the conditions of his love is to follow his commandments and observe his prohibitions but since these are the days of concealment and the sun of eternity remaineth hidden beneath the horizon of being one must gather together everyone with love and protect them the time for the completion of the commandments and the perfection of deeds will assuredly come in the name of our lord the most exalted the most high friend many day hath passed and still the sweet fragrance of thy faithfulness hath failed to reach us hast thou forgotten the one who forgetteth thee not and forsaketh thee not and neglecteth thee not even as thou hast forgotten forsaken and neglected him we have heard that sorrows have compassed thee round in these days thy sorrow hath grieved us and that which hath befallen thee hath touched us with bitter pain and anguish but at this moment friend the herald of eternity announceth unto thee by the robe of faithfulness his joyful tidings and bestoweth upon thee this emerald green tablet set out then from thine abode take thou seven steps upon the earth and with each step complete stage of the journey with the first enter the ocean of search and seek god thy lord with thine inmost heart and soul with the second enter the ocean of love and make mention of god thy lord in the transports of thy longing and the ecstasies of thy rapture with the third tread the paths of detachment that is sever thyself from thine idle fancies and walk in the ways of thy lord with the fourth enter the fathomless depths of oneness and the billowing seas of eternity cover thy face in the dust before the lord of lords and sanctify thy self and thy spirit from all departure and return that thine inmost heart may be freed from all things in the kingdoms of creation with the fifth ascend unto the heaven of wonderment that thou mayest taste the goodly fruits of this blessed realm lose thyself in bewilderment before the power of thy beloved and the dominion of thy creator and proclaim that which the king of existence and the goal of all desire hath proclaimed “increase my wonder and amazement at thee god with the sixth soar upon the wings of submission and contentment unto the cities of the unseen that thou mayest enter the expanses of utter nothingness wherein thou shalt die to thy self and live in him who hath fashioned thee with the seventh drown thyself in the depths of eternity that death may not overtake thee and that thou mayest abide forever in the shadow of the everlasting face of god thereupon shall the fragrance of the all glorious be diffused from the realm of the all merciful and thy heart shall grieve no more over the vicissitudes of fleeting life and the turns of transient fortune when once thou hast privily completed these journeys place this robe upon thy sightless eyes that the eye of thine inmost heart may be opened by god my friend wert thou to attain unto this station thou wouldst find wondrous worlds discover heavenly bowers celestial gardens and transcendent realms and unravel the secrets of the progress of the souls of men through the atmosphere of eternal holiness and the heavens of imperishable glory thou wouldst so rejoice within thy soul as to cause the signs of joy and gladness to appear throughout the whole earth thereafter sorrow would never again hold sway over thee nor would grief ever seize thee in its grasp for thou wouldst abide in the heaven of holiness amidst the concourse of the blissful know thou moreover that in the sight of god thou holdest lofty rank and an exalted station remove not thyself from the company of his servants rather do thou gather them together in the cause of god and admonish them in his days rely upon god in all thine affairs he verily shall suffice thee in all things shall protect thee from the followers of the evil one and shall cause thee to enter the everlasting paradise wherein thou shalt be numbered with the blessed convey then our greetings unto those who follow thee in the cause of thy lord and summon them unto the straight path in the name of the peerless and ever loving lord oshams hearken with all thy heart unto the nightingale song of the beloved that perchance thou mayest abandon the habitation of self and desire and step into the placeless realm of eternal glory forsake thine own life and commune with him who is the life of thy life wert thou to traverse the limitless reaches of the spirit thou wouldst of certainty rend asunder the garment of patience and forbearance hasten to offer up thy soul renounce the dross of this fleeting world and find repose upon the throne of ancient glory each thing must needs have an effect and each sign reveal secret not until the world illuming sun hath shone can the east be distinguished from the west nor the blooming garden discerned from the barren waste heavenly strains compare not with earthly clamours and the croaking of the raven can in no wise be confounded with the song of the nightingale for the latter bespeaketh the land of the beloved and increaseth life whereas the former telleth only of the city of the blind and causeth faith to wither one must step forth and raise aloft the banner of earnest striving by god wert thou to hearken unto the heavenly words of this evanescent servant that have been raised in this mystic tablet thou wouldst assuredly take to the desert of self surrender turn aside from thine own heart and soul and cast thy head at the feet of the friend how high is the soaring flight of the phoenix of love and how low the requisite measure of our yearning strive but little to soar that by the grace of him who is the eternal king thou mayest ascend from the dust heap of utter non existence unto the loftiest heights of ancient glory give wings to thy celestial spirit and lend strength to thy mystic soul that haply it may take flight in the atmosphere of divine nearness and attain the ultimate and invisible goal this profitless world produceth naught save deadly poison and its ephemeral dregs can never yield the everlasting cup were the jesus of the spirit to give ear to the call of holiness from the falcon of the realm above he would assuredly cry out from his inmost being and be seized with fervid longing even as the lover’s soul it is through that call that the moses of eternity was dumbfounded it is by its virtue that the abraham of faithfulness shattered the idol of the mortal body shatter then in turn this idol that thou mayest take up thine abode in the land of the beloved and forsake all desire that thou mayest take flight unto the egypt of imperishable glory sanctify the city of thine heart that thou mayest behold the beauty of the divine essence and be quickened to new life through the grace of the holy spirit no melody remaineth that was not intoned upon this branch no song remaineth that this nightingale hath not warbled thousand arabian ears are powerless to fathom this persian lament—nay none but an embodiment of divine virtues can grasp this subtle mystery well it is then with the one who attaineth this ocean and drinketh therefrom the draught of life thou lion hearted soul even as lion roar that thy roaring may perchanceto the seventh heaven soar praise beto him whose essence is immeasurably exalted above the strivings of human hearts however pure to soar into the atmosphere of his nearness and whose being is immensely sanctified beyond the exertions of human minds however lofty to ascend unto the heaven of his presence from time immemorial he hath been exalted above the description of aught save himself and he will forever continue to be sanctified beyond the praise of all created things the hearts of them that have recognized him are sore perplexed before the tokens of his everlasting handiwork and the minds of them that have attained his court are bewildered by the wondrous evidences of the revealers of his oneness he verily is the all possessing the almighty the most glorious the help in peril the self subsisting friend thine epistle was received it told of naught save the fire which hath been kindled in the tree of human reality and bore no message but that which bestoweth new life upon enlightened hearts well is it with him that hath been set ablaze by the fire of thy love and who hath quaffed the water of life from the cup of thine affection “the righteous shall drink of cup tempered at the camphor fountain to continue thy letter which was repository of the pearls of celestial knowledge was brought before this exile god be praised it rolled up the scrolls of separation and remoteness and spread out in their stead the realms of nearness and reunion methinks through the water of thy longing the fire of separation was changed into “coolness and safety” in truth perfect meeting was attained through thy letter and through thy mention of the stations of divine unity and the signs of pure abstraction and oneness it lifted from the world the veils of limitation and this notwithstanding that even the limitations of the world of existence are praised and cherished by the wayfarer for he seeth all things in the mirror of the verse “no defect canst thou see in the creation of the god of mercy” and at every moment he heareth with his inner ear the tongue of the holy spirit uttering the words “seest thou single flaw in faithlessness he beholdeth the secret of fidelity and in deadly poison he tasteth the sweetest honey even vengeance is embraced in this state nay more the true lover welcometh the betrayal of the beloved thy faithlessness cherish morethan every gift that life can give to suffer at thy vengeful hand—how much dearer than to live thus do the wayfarers in the wilderness of solitude and search experience events and conditions which though to outward seeming be mortal poison are inwardly wholesome draught and though in appearance passing mirage are in reality pure and refreshing waters were to attempt full description of this station neither could express it nor the hearer grasp it and whoso observeth with the eye of innate knowledge will confess openly as well as privily the selfsame truth as to perceived differences these can be attributed to the divers stations that have been attained by them that tread the path of search and mystic knowledge thus at one time the wayfarer beholdeth the lover hastening in search of the beloved through the wilderness of desolation and at another he seeth the beloved yearning for the lover across the wilds of longing and devotion or wandering aimless and bewildered the wastes of love in his pursuit “o for drop to drink the thirsty soul doth groan “o for thirsty soul the spring in turn doth moan from yet another vantage he perceiveth that the lover and the beloved are one and the same and that the seeker is himself the very object of his search “how can the lover from the loved one ever part so it is that at times the lovers of the celestial beauty sound the clarion of “say all things are of god” while at others they raise the call of “it is from thyself some have related the aforementioned stages to the inner and outer journeys of the soul which is the station of “the knowledge of certitude” whilst others that have quaffed the wine of reunion regard each and every stage as relating to that knowledge and consider the two stations of “the eye of certitude” and “the truth of certitude” as being exalted above and sanctified beyond these realms and all that pertaineth unto them even as hath been clearly affirmed by that mystic knower for in all these stages the mirror of the wayfarer’s heart may bear the reflection of shadowy desires wayward thoughts and worldly attachments wherefore hath it been said that in these stations at one time the hosts of reason are triumphant and at another the armies of love prevail at one time the clouds of affliction and sorrow conceal the heavens of gladness and joy at another the eternal leviathan of love devoureth in one fleeting moment all manifestations of sadness anguish grief and dejection and the morn of divine guidance dawneth forth with the joyful tidings of “despair not of god’s mercy” and the gentle breezes of his providence dispel every vestige of torpor and estrangement these tidings however are not constant and immutable in these stations and the wayfarer remaineth confined between the right hand of faith and assurance and the left hand of denial and despair some wayfarers remain forever veiled in these stages others are assisted by invisible aid from the source of unfailing grace whereat the hosts of the realm on high raise the tabernacle of divine power and the ascendency of “and verily our host shall conquer” is manifested obliterating the signs and standards of every worldly attachment and limitation even as alluded to by some who have attained this station at such times the ascendancy of god’s names and attributes will so surround soul as to leave it no place either to stay or to flee this station however hath its own obscurities and impediments for they that journey towards the land of divine unity and detachment are still wrapt within the confines of names and attributes and take delight in their gardens and bowers thus it is that in describing these stations some have made reference to the “unity of existence” and the “unity of appearance” by this is meant that the seeker will close his eyes to all save his beloved and open them to naught but his beauty he will pass beyond the mortal world and approach the everlasting realm he will see no beauty but the beloved’s and hear no utterance but his praise that is he will avert his gaze from aught save his beauty and refuse to hearken to any melody but the sweet accents of his voice howbeit some are led astray even in this station for no sooner do they inhale the fragrance of reunion and hearken unto the voice of the doves of heavenly grace than they imagine themselves to have attained perfection and wander lost in the wilderness of self conceit thus depriving themselves of the soft flowing stream of divine providence and the ethereal cup of heavenly delight yet others assisted by the grace of the everlasting friend consume these veils with the fire of his love and step into the meads of ancient glory that is forsaking the wilderness of the “unity of existence” they attain unto the ultimate abode of the “true appearance of the divine unity” so clearly will they witness in this stage god’s all encompassing mercy that in every created thing both in the world and in the souls of men they will behold him who hath been interpreted as the holy outpouring no longer will they close their eyes to any beauty nor stop their ears from hearkening to any voice for there is no prohibition in this stage and no debarment inasmuch as in all things they will discern with both their outer and inner eyes the revelation of the signs of him who is the king of all names and attributes and in every atom they will find door that leadeth to the garden of divine unity and the city of pure abstraction “where’er turn my gaze ’tis thee whom behold so entirely will the hearts of the wayfarers be transported by longing for the ecstasies of this station that they will come to conceive no stage apart from this stage to see themselves as abiding within the court of the beloved and circling round his sanctuary and to consider it as the ultimate abode of them that search and the uttermost station of such as have attained myriad names and attributes have been ascribed to these degrees and stations which am disinclined to mention here it is indeed solely because of thy longing and devotion that have engaged in such ephemeral and limited topics and this notwithstanding that speech is the greatest evidence of the worth of the speaker and guideth unto the recognition of the source of guidance for no more complete and enduring proof hath been or will be vouchsafed unto man from the empyrean of everlasting glory than words and utterance this verily is self evident truth for the braying of the donkey can never compare with the cooing of the dove never wilt thou hear from the raven the melodies of the nightingale nor inhale from the abject beetle the fragrance of eternity he is the ever living light of truth and sword of faithand soul of generosity no prince hath sky or earth begotwho fain could hope to rival thee know notwhy the tie of love was so abruptly severed and the firm covenant of friendship broken did ever god forbid my devotion lessen or my sincere affection fail that came to be so neglected and forgotten what fault didst thou observe in methat made thee cease thy tender care is it that poverty’s our lotand wealth and pageantry thy share or is it that single arrow hath driven thee from the battle hast thou not heard that steadfastness is the prime requisite of the mystic path and the means of admittance to his holy court “they that say ‘our lord is god’ and continue steadfast in his way upon them verily shall the angels descend likewise he saith “be thou steadfast as thou hast been bidden it followeth that they that abide in the court of reunion must needs conduct themselves accordingly do as bidden and convey the message whether it give thee counsel or offence though have received no reply to my letter and it would be unbefitting in the eyes of the wise to express anew my devotion yet this new love hath annulled and effaced all the old rules and ways tell us not the tale of laylí nor speak of majnún’s woe—thy love hath made the world forget the loves of long ago when once thy name was on the tongue it reached the lovers’ earsand set the speakers and the hearers dancing to and fro and as to divine wisdom and heavenly admonitions each moon my belov’d for three days go mad today’s the first of these—’tis why thou seest me glad hear that thou hast journeyed to tabríz and tiflis to engage in debate and instruction or hast set out for sanandaj to scale the heights of knowledge my eminent friend they that seek to ascend to the heaven of mystic wayfaring are of four kinds only shall describe them in brief that the signs and degrees of each may become plain and manifest to thee if the wayfarers be among them that seek afterthe sanctuary of the desired one this plane pertaineth to the self—but the self which is intended is “the self of god that pervadeth all his laws” in this station the self is not rejected but beloved it is regarded with favour and is not to be shunned although at the beginning this plane is the realm of conflict yet it endeth in the ascent to the throne of glory as it hath been said abraham of the spirit and god’s friend in this day slay slay these four thieving birds of prey that after death the mystery of life may be unravelled this is the plane of the soul that is pleasing unto god whereof he saith “enter thou among my servants and enter thou my paradise this station hath myriad signs and countless tokens hence it is said “we will surely show them our signs in the world and within themselves until it become plain to them that there is no god save him one must then read the book of one’s own self rather than the treatise of some grammarian wherefore he hath said “read thy book there needeth none but thyself to make out an account against thee this day the story is told of mystic knower who went on journey with learned grammarian for companion they came to the shore of the sea of grandeur the knower putting his trust in god straightway flung himself into the waves but the grammarian stood bewildered and lost in thoughts that were as words traced upon the water the mystic called out to him “why dost thou not follow the grammarian answered “o brother what can do as dare not advance must needs go back again then the mystic cried “cast aside what thou hast learned from síbavayh and qawlavayh from ibn ḥájib and ibn málik and cross the water with renunciation not with grammar’s rules one must be armed be nothing then and cross this sea unharmed likewise he saith “and be ye not like those who forget god and whom he hath therefore caused to forget their own selves such men are the evil doers if the wayfarers be among them that dwell inthe court of the all praised this is the station of the intellect which is known as the messenger of the realm of the body and the most great pillar that which is intended however is the universal divine intellect whose sovereignty fostereth the growth of all things and not every vain and feeble mind thus hath the wise saná’í written how can feeble reason embrace the qur’ánor the spider snare phoenix in its web wouldst thou that the mind not hold thee in its snare seize it and enrol it in the school of god instead on this plane the traveller meeteth with many trial and reverse now is he lifted up to heaven now is he cast into the depths as it hath been said “now thou drawest me to the throne of the realms above again thou scorchest me in the fire of hell the hidden mystery of this station is divulged in the following blessed verse from the súrih of the cave “and thou mightest have seen the sun when it arose pass on the right of their cave and when it set leave them on the left while they were in its spacious chamber this is one of the signs of god guided indeed is he whom god guideth but for him whom he misleadeth thou shalt by no means find guardian and guide if soul could grasp the allusions that lie hid in this single verse it would suffice him such indeed are those whom he hath extolled as “men whom neither merchandise nor traffic beguile from the remembrance of god” this station is that of the true standard of knowledge and the final end of tests and trials nor is it needed in this realm to seek after knowledge for he hath said concerning the guidance of wayfarers on this plane “fear ye god god will teach you” and again “knowledge is light which god casteth into the heart of whomsoever he willeth wherefore one must make ready the receptacle and become worthy of the descent of heavenly bestowals that the all sufficing cup bearer may give one to drink of the wine of bounty from the crystal chalice of mercy “for this let the striving strive and now do say “verily we are god’s and to him shall we return if the lovers be among them that abide within the precincts ofthe abode of the lodestone of hearts no soul may dwell on this kingly throne save the countenance of love am powerless to describe this station or to depict it in words love shunneth this world and that world too in him are lunacies seventy and two the minstrel of love harpeth this lay servitude enslaveth lordship doth betray this plane demandeth pure love and unalloyed affection in describing these companions he saith “they speak not till he hath spoken and act according to his commandment in this station neither the reign of the intellect is sufficient nor the rule of self thus one of the prophets of god asked “o my lord how shall reach thee and the answer came “leave thy self behind and then approach me in the estimation of such souls to be seated amidst the sandals by the door is the same as to abide at the place of honour and in the path of the beloved the retreats of earthly beauty differ not from the field of battle waged the dwellers of this abode know not the destination yet they spur on their chargers they see naught in the beloved but his very self they find all words of sense to be meaningless and senseless words to be full of meaning they cannot distinguish head from foot or one limb from another to them the mirage is water itself and departure is the mystery of return wherefore hath it been said the story of thy beauty reached the hermit’s dell crazed he sought the tavern where the wine they buy and sell the love of thee hath levelled down the fort of patience the pain of thee hath firmly barred the gate of hope as well in this station both instruction and apprenticeship are assuredly of no avail the lovers’ teacher is the loved one’s beauty his face their lesson and their only book learning of wonderment of longing love their duty not on learned chapters and dull themes they look the chains that bind them are his musky hair the cyclic scheme to them is but to him stair here followeth supplication to god—blessed and glorified be he lord thou whose grace fulfilleth every need to mention aught before thee would be sin indeed allow this mote of knowledge hidden in my soulto free itself of lowly clay and reach its goal and grant this drop of wisdom thatthou gavest me to be at last united with thy mighty sea thus do say there is no power nor strength except in god the help in peril the self subsisting if the mystic knowers be among them that have attainedthe beauty of the beloved this station is the throne of the inmost heart and the secret of divine guidance this is the seat of the mystery “he doeth what he willeth and ordaineth what he pleaseth should all that are in heaven and on earth attempt to unravel this exalted allusion and subtle mystery from now until the day whereon the trumpet shall sound yet would they fail to comprehend even letter thereof for this is the station of god’s immutable decree and his foreordained mystery hence when asked regarding this matter he made reply “it is bottomless sea that none shall ever fathom and when the question was repeated he answered “it is the blackest of nights through which none can find his way whoso comprehendeth this station will assuredly conceal it and were he to reveal but the faintest trace thereof they would assuredly hang him from the gallows and yet by god were true seeker to be found would divulge it to him for he saith “love is distinction never conferred upon heart possessed by fear and dread in truth the wayfarer who journeyeth unto god who treadeth the snow white path and turneth towards the crimson pillar will never reach his heavenly home unless his hands are empty of such worldly things as are cherished by men “and he that feareth not god god shall make him to fear all things whereas all things fear him who feareth god ”speak the persian tongue though the arabian pleaseth more love indeed doth have hundred other tongues in store how sweet in this connection is the following couplet our hearts will be as open shellsshould he the pearls of grace bestow our lives will ready targets bewere he to hurl the darts of woe and were it not contrary to the commandment of the book would surely have bestowed part of my possessions upon my would be murderer and given him to inherit mine earthly goods and rendered him myriad thanks and solaced mine own eyes with the touch of his hand but what can do neither have any wealth nor hath the lord of destiny so decreed methinks at this moment perceive the musk scented fragrance of the garment of há’ from the joseph of bahá verily he seemeth near at hand though ye may think him far away my soul doth sense the fragrant breathof well beloved soul the fragrance of that kindly friendwho’s my heart’s desire and goal the duty of long years of love obey and tell the tale of blissful days gone by that land and sky may laugh aloud today and it may gladden mind and heart and eye this is the realm of pure awareness and utter self effacement not even love can find way to this plane nor doth affection have place therein wherefore is it said “love is veil betwixt the lover and the beloved here love becometh but an obstructing veil and aught save the friend but curtain thus the wise saná’í hath written none may approach that well belov’dwho harboreth his own desire none may embrace that beauteous formwho’s burdened with his own attire for this is the realm of god and is sanctified above every allusion of his creatures abiding in the court of rapture the dwellers of this mansion wield with utmost joy and gladness the sceptres of divinity and lordship and established upon the lofty seats of justice they exert their rule and bestow upon every soul its due those who drink of this cup abide beneath the canopy of glory above the throne of the ancient of days and dwell upon the seat of grandeur beneath the tabernacle of majesty these are they that “know neither sun nor piercing cold” on this plane the highest heavens are neither opposed to nor distinguished from the lowly earth for this is the realm of divine favours not the arena of worldly contraries albeit at every moment new condition be displayed yet that condition is ever the same wherefore he saith in one instance “nothing whatsoever keepeth him from being occupied with any other thing and in another he saith “verily his ways differ every day this is the food whose savour changeth not and whose colour altereth not wert thou to partake thereof thou wouldst assuredly recite the verse “i have turned my face to him who hath created the heavens and the earth following the right religion and submissive before god am not one of those who add gods to god “and thus did we show abraham the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth that he might be stablished in knowledge wherefore put thy hand into thy bosom then stretch it forth with power and behold thou shalt find it light unto all the world how clear this crystal water that the enraptured cup bearer passeth round how exquisite this pure wine that the intoxicated beauty doth proffer how pleasing this draught of joy that floweth from the heavenly cup well is it with him who drinketh thereof and tasteth of its sweetness and attaineth unto its knowledge no more than this will impart to thee the riverbed can never hold the sea for its mystery lieth hid in the storehouses of his inviolable protection and is laid up in the treasuries of his power it is exalted above the highest essence of utterance and sanctified beyond the subtlest mode of explanation astonishment here is highly prized and utter poverty greatly cherished wherefore hath he said “poverty is my pride and again “god hath people beneath the canopy of grandeur whom he hath concealed in the garment of poverty to exalt in rank these are they who see with his eyes and hear with his ears as hath been recorded in the well known tradition concerning this realm there is many tradition and many verse whether of general or specific import but two of these will suffice that they may serve as light for knowing hearts and bring delight to longing souls the first is his statement “o my servant obey me that may make thee like unto myself for say ‘be’ and it is and thou shalt say ‘be’ and it shall be and the second “o son of adam seek fellowship with none until thou hast found me and whensoever thou shalt long for me thou shalt find me nigh unto thee whatever high proofs and wondrous allusions are recounted herein concern but single letter and single point for such is god’s method and no change canst thou find in his mode of dealing undertook to write this epistle some time ago in thy remembrance and since thy letter had not reached me yet began with few words of grievance and reproach now thy new missive hath dispelled that feeling and hath caused me to send thee this letter to speak of my love for thine eminence is needless “sufficient witness is god unto us as for his eminenceshaykhmuḥammad—may god the exalted bless him —i shall confine myself to the two following lines which request be delivered to him seek thy nearness more desired than heaven in mine eyes see thy visage fairer than the bowers of paradise when entrusted this message of love to my pen it refused the burden and swooned away then coming to itself it spoke and said “glory be to thee to thee do turn in penitence and am the first of them that implore thy pardon all praise be to god the lord of the worlds let us tell some other

subject to the terms of use found atwww bahai org legal last modified july gmt selections from the writings of bahá’u’lláh for bahá’í holy days the observance of holy days occupies central place in every religion through their commemoration the calendar year becomes the stage on which the signal events associated with the life and ministry of the divine manifestations of god are annually remembered and honoured this remembrance has both personal dimension providing time for reflection on the significance of these events and social dimension helping to deepen the identity and foster the cohesion of the community the coming of each manifestation of god brings renewal and revitalization “old things are passed away” and “all things are become new” by his authority former laws are abrogated and the manners and customs of the previous dispensation are reformed through the creative power of divine revelation fresh life is instilled into hearts and souls reflect thou how in one hand he hath by his mighty grasp turned the earth of knowledge and understanding previously unfolded into mere handful and on the other spread out new and highly exalted earth in the hearts of men thus causing the freshest and loveliest blossoms and the mightiest and loftiest trees to spring forth from the illumined bosom of man this re creation and revitalization of all things is reflected in the introduction of new calendar and the designation of new holy days which recast the rhythms of communal life the bahá’í calendar known as the badí‘ calendar was introduced by the báb and subsequently confirmed by bahá’u’lláh who fixed its commencement at the year of the báb’s declaration as the bahá’í era was inaugurated by twin founders the bahá’í holy days include events pertaining to the birth declaration and passing of both bahá’u’lláh and the báb in the kitáb aqdas the principal repository of the laws of his revelation bahá’u’lláh designates the two “most great festivals” riḍván “the king of festivals” commemorating the declaration of his prophetic mission during period of twelve days three of which are observed as holy days and the declaration of the báb the event that initiates the bahá’í era also named as festivals in that same book are naw rúz and the anniversaries of the birth of the báb and of bahá’u’lláh the anniversary of the martyrdom of the báb was commemorated as holy day during the lifetime of bahá’u’lláh and ‘abdu’l‑bahá added the observance of the ascension of bahá’u’lláh the present volume offers forty five selections from the writings of bahá’u’lláh revealed specifically for or otherwise relating to these nine holy days the selections represent different revelatory modes each reflecting facets of the greatness the preciousness and the peerless nature of this day in which all the promises and prophecies of the past have been fulfilled—this sacred day “whereon god hath made his own self known and revealed it unto all who are in the heavens and on earth” some of the tablets and excerpts presented in the volume are addressed to the body of bahá’u’lláh’s followers and are expressed in celebratory and uplifting tone occasionally with repeated refrains while others were revealed to individual believers sometimes with mention of the specific circumstances of their revelation or the names of the recipients many are among his best known works and have long been familiar to readers of his writings in the original languages eight of the selections were previously translated by shoghi effendi and published inprayers and meditations by bahá’u’lláhandgleanings from the writings of bahá’u’lláh table listing these and other passages translated by shoghi effendi can be found at the end of the book the remainder of the selections are for the most part published here for the first time in english the current translations endeavour to afford glimpse of the poetic tone of these celebrated texts even though they can never convey their full beauty it is hoped that this volume will uplift the hearts and souls of the followers of the blessed beauty throughout the world and will enrich the gatherings they hold in commemoration of those days that stand apart from all other days through their association with him and his herald he is the almighty praised be thou my god that thou hast ordained naw rúz as festival unto those who have observed the fast for love of thee and abstained from all that is abhorrent unto thee grant my lord that the fire of thy love and the heat produced by the fast enjoined by thee may inflame them in thy cause and make them to be occupied with thy praise and with remembrance of thee since thou hast adorned them my lord with the ornament of the fast prescribed by thee do thou adorn them also with the ornament of thine acceptance through thy grace and bountiful favour for the doings of men are all dependent upon thy good pleasure and are conditioned by thy behest shouldst thou regard him who hath broken the fast as one who hath observed it such man would be reckoned among them who from eternity had been keeping the fast and shouldst thou decree that he who hath observed the fast hath broken it that person would be numbered with such as have caused the robe of thy revelation to be stained with dust and been far removed from the crystal waters of this living fountain thou art he through whom the ensign “praiseworthy art thou in thy works” hath been lifted up and the standard “obeyed art thou in thy behest” hath been unfurled make known this thy station my god unto thy servants that they may be made aware that the excellence of all things is dependent upon thy bidding and thy word and the virtue of every act is conditioned by thy leave and the good pleasure of thy will and may recognize that the reins of men’s doings are within the grasp of thine acceptance and thy commandment make this known unto them that nothing whatsoever may shut them out from thy beauty in these days whereon the christ exclaimeth “all dominion is thine thou the begetter of the spirit jesus and thy friend muḥammad crieth out “glory be to thee thou the best beloved for that thou hast uncovered thy beauty and written down for thy chosen ones what will cause them to attain unto the seat of the revelation of thy most great name through which all the peoples have lamented except such as have detached themselves from all else except thee and set themselves towards him who is the revealer of thyself and the manifestation of thine attributes he who is thy branch and all thy company my lord have broken this day their fast after having observed it within the precincts of thy court and in their eagerness to please thee do thou ordain for him and for them and for all such as have entered thy presence in those days all the good thou didst destine in thy book supply them then with that which will profit them in both this life and the life beyond thou in truth art the all knowing the all wise am the most holy the most great the most glorious praise be to thee my god that thou hast ordained this day as festival unto the favoured among thy servants and the sincere among thy loved ones thou hast called this day by that name whereby all created things have been subdued and the breezes of thy revelation have been wafted between earth and heaven name through which all that hath been recorded in thy holy books and sacred scriptures hath been made manifest and which thy messengers and thy chosen ones have foretold that all men might be made ready to behold thee to turn towards the ocean of thy reunion to stand before the seat of thy throne and to hear thy wondrous call from the dayspring of thine invisible self and the dawning place of thine essence yield thee praise lord my god that thou hast fulfilled thy testimony completed thy favour established upon the throne of divine revelation him who proclaimed thy oneness and thy unity and summoned all humanity to appear before him amongst the people are those who have turned towards him attained his presence and quaffed the choice wine of his revelation beseech thee by thy sovereign might which hath dominion over all things and by thy bounty which embraceth the entire creation to enable thy loved ones to sever themselves from all except thee and to fix their gaze upon the horizon of thy grace assist them then to arise to serve thee that they may evince whatsoever thou hast desired in thy realm and may unfurl the banners of thy victory in thy land thou verily art the almighty the most exalted the sovereign protector the all knowing the all wise yield thee praise lord my god that thou hast made this prison to be throne for thy kingdom heaven for thy heavens dayspring for thy daysprings dawning place for thy dawns source for the outpourings of thy bounty and spirit of life unto the bodies of thy creatures entreat thee to aid thy chosen ones to act in accordance with thy good pleasure sanctify them then my god from whatsoever may soil the hem of their garments in thy days thou seest lord in certain lands that which runneth counter to thy pleasure and thou beholdest those who claim to love thee committing the very deeds that thine enemies have committed purify them lord with the living waters wherewith thou hast purified the well favoured amongst thy people and the sincere amongst thy servants purge them moreover from whatsoever may tarnish the fair name of thy cause in thy lands or veil the people of thy cities from thy recognition implore thee lord by thy name that transcendeth all other names to guard them from following the path of self and passion that all may unite around that which thou hast commanded in thy book make them then to be hands of thy cause that through them thy verses may be spread abroad throughout thine earth and the emblems of thy holiness may be manifested amidst thy people potent art thou to do as thou pleasest there is none other god but thee the help in peril the self subsisting he is the most holy the most mighty the most exalted praise be unto thee thou who art the lord of the world and the ruler of the nations testify that thou hast from eternity been sanctified above the mention of all created things and exalted beyond the loftiest descriptions of thy creatures whensoever thy devoted servants sought to ascend unto the station of thy recognition the hosts of thy knowledge barred their way and whensoever thy near ones desired to gain admittance to the heaven of thy nearness the overpowering majesty of thine utterance kept them back we bear witness that the loftiest of the divine names are but servants at thy door and that their most glorious manifestations bow down before thy countenance and are humbled in thy presence thou art in truth he who can neither be described in letters nor evoked by words nor even contained within the hidden meanings they conceal for these are all circumscribed by the inherent limitations of speech which characterize all the utterances of the peoples of the world exalted immeasurably exalted art thou above the mention of every soul and the understanding of every heart exalted immeasurably exalted art thou above the description of anyone save thyself and beyond every conception of thy creatures were thine own manifestations to soar upon the wings of the seen and the unseen yet would they fail to attain unto the first effulgence shining from the horizon of thy most exalted countenance and the dawning place of thy most sublime revelation and were the exponents of thy lordship enabled to ascend for as long as the kingdoms of earth and heaven endure yet would they be forever powerless to draw nigh unto the day star of thy beauty blessed be the one who comprehendeth thine enduring reality and the evanescence of all else but thee and who acknowledgeth thy sovereign authority and the powerlessness of all save thyself and as the evanescence of all things is established before the surging ocean of thy remembrance king of all names it likewise becometh evident that their every mention and description falleth short of thy might and grandeur and ill beseemeth thy loftiness and power and yet in spite of this my god thou hast out of the wonders of thy grace and munificence and as token of thy bounty and thy favour enjoined upon all to make mention of thee and to praise thee and hast accepted their glorification of thee out of thy grace and generosity wherefore doth thine own self call on thy self and thy very essence invoke thine essence on behalf of thy lovers who have borne every hardship in thy path and every adversity out of love for thee and contentment with thy good pleasure in this blessed day which thou hast made to be festival for the inmates of thy kingdom and for those who have kept the fast by thy command and obeyed thy resistless decree exalted be this blessed and glorious day which thou hast designated by that beloved name which is both hidden and manifest and which when it shone forth above the horizon of eternity the divine lote tree called out saying “by god the lord of creation hath come whom no name can describe whereupon paradise was set astir and proclaimed with joy and fervour “o concourse of the world he hath come round whom circle the daysprings of the all merciful the manifestations of the all praised and the dawning places of inspiration and all things cried aloud “this is that tablet with which the kingdom of creation hath been adorned and through which the gate leading unto the divine presence hath been flung open unto all who are in heaven and on earth happy the one who hath forsaken every desire and hath drawn nigh unto the one whose reality no word or utterance can convey by god this is the day whereon from the murmur of the waters can be heard “no god is there but him the help in peril the self subsisting” and from the whispering of whose breezes can be heard “no god is there but him the almighty the best beloved” and from the rustling of whose trees can be heard “no god is there but him the most powerful the ever giving the all glorious the all loving” and beyond them from the tongue of grandeur can be heard “this is the day of the appearance of him who is manifest yet hidden who is visible yet concealed hasten unto him ye who are the daysprings of the divine names and draw nigh unto him ye who dwell in the kingdom of creation with hearts that have been purified from superstitions and vain imaginings and sanctified from the idle talk of men immeasurably exalted is the state of thy loved ones who have clung to the cord of thy command held fast to the hem of thine ordinances uttered that which hath been permitted unto them in thy tablets transgressed not the bounds ordained in thy book and spoken out in thy lands with wisdom as decreed in the scrolls of thy bounty and the epistles of thy grace lord assist them to arise for the triumph of thy cause through what thou hast expounded unto them with thy most exalted pen and what thou hast instructed them in certain of thy tablets lord leave them not to themselves but keep them safe through thy sovereignty and power and assist them through thy might and bounty lord they are thy servants and bondsmen who have believed in thee and have drawn nigh unto the heaven of thy bounty suffer them not to be deprived of the tokens of thy tender mercies in thy days neither do thou withhold from them the fragrance of the roses of thy wisdom guide them then my god to the ocean of thy good pleasure that in thy name they may immerse themselves therein and that they may not be saddened by that which their own minds have conceived nor grieved by all that they have witnessed in thy path verily thou art the all powerful one whose might every powerful one hath recognized whose sovereignty every possessor of majesty hath acknowledged before the waves of the ocean of whose knowledge every learned one confesseth his ignorance and before the evidences of whose power every soul endued with strength admitteth his helplessness thou art the one my god to whom every name is abashed to be related and in whose presence all things shrink for shame from being mentioned from eternity thou hast dwelt in those transcendent heights that are exalted above all mention and description how great are thy sovereignty and thy power and how mighty thy grandeur —this though all things acknowledge that thou art entirely sanctified from and immeasurably exalted above all but thine own self thou hast subdued the entire world through single word that hath been related to the kingdom of thine utterance and from which the fragrance of the robe of thy command hath been wafted lord of all being and educator of all things visible and invisible grant us ears that are pure hearts that are sanctified and eyes that see so that we may discover the sweetness of thine enthralling utterance may fix our gaze upon thy supreme horizon and may come to know whatever hath been sent down through thy bounty thou who art the king of names kindle then the fire of thy love in thy lands that the hearts of thy creatures may be set ablaze thereby that they may turn towards thee may recognize thy unity and acknowledge thy oneness lord of all names rend asunder before their faces the veils of glory and make known unto them the excellence of this day which hath been adorned with thy name and illumined with the light of thy countenance thou verily art he whom the good works of the people can never exalt nor their evil deeds deter whom the ascendancy of the rulers cannot humble nor the power of the mighty vanquish thou doest through thy sovereignty whatsoever thou willest no god is there but thee the all powerful the most exalted the all knowing the all wise send down then upon thy loved ones my god from the heaven of thy bounty that which will cause them to fix their gaze upon thee and to act in accordance with thy will and behest ordain for them then what will profit them and preserve them what will draw them nigh and set them free verily thou art their lord their creator and their helper no god is there but thee the ever forgiving the most generous beseech thee moreover my god to unite the hearts of thy loved ones and to join them together in harmony and fellowship in thy cause that naught may appear from them that would ill beseem them in thy days thou verily art the all powerful the most exalted the most high the most great praise be to god the lord of the worlds he is the ever living the ever abiding the self subsisting god testifieth to the unity of his godhood and to the singleness of his own being on the throne of eternity from the inaccessible heights of his station his tongue proclaimeth that there is none other god but him he himself independently of all else hath ever been witness unto his own oneness the revealer of his own nature the glorifier of his own essence he verily is the all powerful the almighty the beauteous he is supreme over his servants and standeth over his creatures in his hand is the source of authority and truth he maketh men alive by his signs and causeth them to die through his wrath he shall not be asked of his doings and his might is equal unto all things he is the potent the all subduing he holdeth within his grasp the empire of all things and on his right hand is fixed the kingdom of his revelation his power verily embraceth the whole of creation victory and overlordship are his all might and dominion are his all glory and greatness are his he of truth is the all glorious the most powerful the unconditioned praise be to thee to whom the tongues of all created things have from eternity called and yet failed to attain the heaven of thine eternal holiness and grandeur the eyes of all beings have been opened to behold the beauty of thy radiant countenance yet none hath succeeded in gazing on the brightness of the light of thy face the hands of them that are nigh unto thee have ever since the foundation of thy glorious sovereignty and the establishment of thy holy dominion been raised suppliantly towards thee yet no one hath been able to touch the hem of the robe that clotheth thy divine and sovereign essence and yet none can deny that thou hast ever been through the wonders of thy generosity and bounty supreme over all things art powerful to do all things and art nearer unto all things than they are unto themselves far be it then from thy glory that anyone should gaze on thy wondrous beauty with any eye save thine own eye or hear the melodies proclaiming thine almighty sovereignty with any ear except thine own ear too high art thou exalted for the eye of any creature to behold thy beauty or for the understanding of any heart to scale the heights of thine immeasurable knowledge for should the birds of the hearts of them that are nigh unto thee be ever enabled to soar as long as thine own overpowering sovereignty can endure or to ascend as long as the empire of thy divine holiness can last they shall in no wise be able to transcend the limitations which contingent world hath imposed upon them nor pass beyond its confines how then can he whose very creation is restricted by such limitations attain unto him who is the lord of the kingdom of all created things or ascend into the heaven of him who ruleth the realms of loftiness and grandeur glorified immeasurably glorified art thou my best beloved inasmuch as thou hast ordained that the utmost limit to which they who lift their hearts to thee can rise is the confession of their powerlessness to enter the realms of thy holy and transcendent unity and that the highest station which they who aspire to know thee can reach is the acknowledgement of their impotence to attain the retreats of thy sublime knowledge therefore beseech thee by this very powerlessness which is beloved of thee and which thou hast decreed as the goal of them that have reached and attained thy court and by the splendours of thy countenance that have encompassed all things and by the energies of thy will whereby the entire creation hath been generated not to deprive them that have set their hopes in thee of the wonders of thy mercy nor to withhold from such as have sought thee the treasures of thy grace ignite then within their hearts the torch of thy love that its flame may consume all else except their wondrous remembrance of thee and that no trace may be left in those hearts except the gem like evidences of thy most holy sovereignty so that from the land wherein they dwell no voice may be heard except the voice that extolleth thy mercifulness and might that on the earth on which they walk no light may shine except the light of thy beauty and that within every soul naught may be discovered except the revelation of thy countenance and the tokens of thy glory that haply thy servants may show forth only that which shall please thee and shall conform wholly unto thy most potent will glory be to thee my god the power of thy might beareth me witness can have no doubt that should the holy breaths of thy loving kindness and the breeze of thy bountiful favour cease for less than the twinkling of an eye to breathe over all created things the entire creation would perish and all that are in heaven and on earth would be reduced to utter nothingness magnified therefore be the marvellous evidences of thy transcendent power magnified be the potency of thine exalted might magnified be the majesty of thine all encompassing greatness and the energizing influence of thy will such is thy greatness that wert thou to concentrate the eyes of all men in the eye of one of thy servants and to compress all their hearts within his heart and wert thou to enable him to behold within himself all the things thou hast created through thy power and fashioned through thy might and were he to ponder throughout eternity over the realms of thy creation and the range of thy handiwork he would unfailingly discover that there is no created thing but is overshadowed by thine all conquering power and is vitalized through thine all embracing sovereignty behold me then my god fallen prostrate upon the dust before thee confessing my powerlessness and thine omnipotence my poverty and thy wealth mine evanescence and thine eternity mine utter abasement and thine infinite glory recognize that there is none other god but thee that thou hast no peer nor partner none to equal or rival thee in thine unapproachable loftiness thou hast from eternity been exalted above the praise of any one but thee and shalt continue for ever in thy transcendent singleness and glory to be sanctified from the glorification of any one except thine own self swear by thy might my beloved to make mention of any created thing beseemeth not thy most exalted self and to bestow any praise upon any one of thy creatures would be wholly unworthy of thy great glory nay such mention would be but blasphemy uttered within the court of thy holiness and such praise would amount to no less than transgression in the face of the evidences of thy divine sovereignty for the mere mention of any one of thy creatures would in itself imply an assertion of their existence before the court of thy singleness and unity such an assertion would be naught but open blasphemy an act of impiety the essence of profanity and wanton crime wherefore bear witness with my soul my spirit my entire being that should they who are the daysprings of thy most holy unity and the manifestations of thy transcendent oneness be able to soar so long as thine own sovereignty endureth and thine all compelling authority can last they will fail in the end to attain unto even the precincts of the court wherein thou didst reveal the effulgence of but one of thy most mighty names glorified glorified be therefore thy wondrous majesty glorified glorified be thine unattainable loftiness glorified glorified be the pre eminence of thy kingship and the sublimity of thine authority and power the highest faculties which the learned have possessed and whatsoever truths they in their search after the gems of thy knowledge have discovered the brightest realities with which the wise have been endowed and whatever secrets they in their attempts to fathom the mysteries of thy wisdom have unravelled have all been created through the generative power of the spirit that was breathed into the pen which thy hands have fashioned how then can the thing which thy pen hath created be capable of comprehending those treasures of thy faith with which as decreed by thee that pen hath been invested how can it ever know of the fingers that grasp thy pen and of thy merciful favours with which it hath been endowed how can it already unable to reach this station be made aware of the existence of thy hand that controlleth the fingers of thy might how can it attain unto the comprehension of the nature of thy will that animateth the movement of thy hand glorified glorified be thou my god how can ever hope to ascend into the heaven of thy most holy will or gain admittance into the tabernacle of thy divine knowledge knowing as do that the minds of the wise and learned are impotent to fathom the secrets of thy handiwork—a handiwork which is itself but creation of thy will praise be to thee lord my god my master my possessor my king now that have confessed unto thee my powerlessness and the powerlessness of all created things and have acknowledged my poverty and the poverty of the entire creation call unto thee with my tongue and the tongues of all that are in heaven and on earth and beseech thee with my heart and the hearts of all that have entered beneath the shadow of thy names and thine attributes not to shut us from the doors of thy loving kindness and grace nor to suffer the breeze of thy bountiful care and favour to cease from being wafted over our souls nor to permit that our hearts be occupied with any one except thee or our minds to be busied with any remembrance save remembrance of thy self by the glory of thy might my god wert thou to set me king over thy realms and to establish me upon the throne of thy sovereignty and to deliver through thy power the reins of the entire creation into my hands and wert thou to cause me though it be for less than moment to be occupied with these things and be oblivious of the wondrous memories associated with thy most mighty most perfect and most exalted name my soul would still remain unsatisfied and the pangs of my heart unstilled nay would in that very state recognize myself as the poorest of the poor and the most wretched of wretches magnified be thy name my god now that thou hast caused me to apprehend this truth beseech thee by thy name which no scroll can bear which no heart can imagine and no tongue can utter—a name which will remain concealed so long as thine own essence is hidden and will be glorified so long as thine own being is extolled—to unfurl ere the present year draw to close the ensigns of thine undisputed ascendancy and triumph that the whole creation may be enriched by thy wealth and may be exalted through the ennobling influence of thy transcendent sovereignty and that all may arise and promote thy cause thou art verily the almighty the all highest the all glorious the all subduing the all possessing he is the sovereign king the holy of holies praise be unto thee lord my god this is that day among thy days and that hour among thy blessed hours which thou hast reserved for thine own self related to thine own being and exalted in station that thy name may endure and thy sovereignty be made manifest thou hast made this day to be the source of all days inasmuch as thou hast showered upon it the revelations of the throne of thy majesty and the signs of thy transcendent favour thou hast created it anew at this time in the most excellent form in this ancient temple so that on this day and by its grace all the dwellers of earth and heaven might be raised again to life and unbeknownst to and unapprehended by all be called upon to render account regarding thy self perchance thy sacred and celestial blessings and thy divine and glorious bestowals might be completed therein that they may testify to the creation of all things on the day of thy presence and to the appearance of thy days and the dawning of the sun of thy beauty even as mention was made of this signal honour and supreme bounty of the ecstasy of yearning for thee the ascendancy of thine all conquering love and the transports of thy holy rapture heard the call of one of thy servants who hath believed in thee and in thy signs who hath renounced all things turned towards the countenance of thy beauty and hastened through every region unto the habitation of thy repose he hath at last reached thy door and stood before the light of thine everlasting holiness that hath shone forth above the horizon of thy oneness and the dayspring of thine eternity longing to ascend unto the heights of thy presence and reunion and to abide upon the seat of thy nearness within thy sacred precinct cause then my god the dove of yearning to soar within his heart and the seas of thy love to surge within his inmost being and the matchless tokens of thy remembrance to flow from his tongue and the gems of thy praise to issue from his spirit draw him ever nearer my lord that he may be enabled to safeguard within the inmost recesses of his heart this most brilliant light and hidden treasure and that he may thus dwell with thy servant in thy most exalted horizon and all glorious realm thou verily abidest even now in thine everlasting habitation and beholdest this crimson spirit and hearest this most sweet melody in the midmost heart of the divine essence the centre of the realm of mysteries powerful art thou to do what thou willest thou verily art the exalted the almighty the all glorious the self subsisting in the name of him who hath cast his splendour over the entire creation the divine springtime is come most exalted pen for the festival of the all merciful is fast approaching bestir thyself and magnify before the entire creation the name of god and celebrate his praise in such wise that all created things may be regenerated

ornament of the name of thy lord the creator of the heavens arise before the nations of the earth and arm thyself with the power of this most great name and be not of those who tarry methinks that thou hast halted and movest not upon my tablet could the brightness of the divine countenance have bewildered thee or the idle talk of the froward filled thee with grief and paralysed thy movement take heed lest anything deter thee from extolling the greatness of this day—the day whereon the finger of majesty and power hath opened the seal of the wine of reunion and called all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth preferrest thou to tarry when the breeze announcing the day of god hath already breathed over thee or art thou of them that are shut out as by veil from him no veil whatever have allowed lord of all names and creator of the heavens to shut me from the recognition of the glories of thy day—the day which is the lamp of guidance unto the whole world and the sign of the ancient of days unto all them that dwell therein my silence is by reason of the veils that have blinded thy creatures’ eyes to thee and my muteness is because of the impediments that have hindered thy people from recognizing thy truth thou knowest what is in me but know not what is in thee thou art the all knowing the all informed by thy name that excelleth all other names if thy overruling and all compelling behest should ever reach me it would empower me to revive the souls of all men through thy most exalted word which have heard uttered by thy tongue of power in thy

ancient of days this is the day whereon the unseen world crieth out “great is thy blessedness earth for thou hast been made the footstool of thy god and been chosen as the seat of his mighty throne

oppressors of thy people with the eye of thine avenging wrath by thy might their iniquity hath reached such heights as none can reckon save thyself who knowest all things thy loved ones acquiesced to captivity and confinement in this prison and yet their enemies were still not satisfied so intense was their hatred for the manifestation of thy cause blessed be the man of insight who seeth in all that hath befallen him in thy path naught save that which shall exalt his station and magnify thy cause thou the lord of the worlds by thy glory were all the peoples of the earth to join together to harm single one of the people of bahá they would find themselves powerless for all that they see as harming thy chosen ones is as light unto them and as fire unto thine enemies were it not for the

the first day that the ancient beauty ascended his most great throne in the garden named riḍván the tongue of glory gave utterance to three blessed words first that in this revelation the law of the sword hath been annulled second that ere the expiration of one thousand years whosoever advanceth prophetic claim is false by “year” full year is intended and no exegesis or interpretation is permitted in this matter and third that at that very hour god exalted be his glory shed the full splendour of all his names upon all creation the following verse was revealed subsequently but he indicated that it should occupy the same station as the other three that when the name of anyone whether living or dead is mentioned in his presence that soul hath verily attained to the mention of the pre existent king blessed are they that attain thereto the day star of words dawning above the horizon of the utterance of him who is the lord of all names and attributes hath at this most blessed of hours shone forth in all truth with the splendours of the light of god the spirit of understanding flowing from the pen of the all glorious hath by virtue of his grace been conferred upon all created things the mystery of all mysteries emerging from behind the veils of concealment hath in very truth been revealed to the righteous as bidden by god the almighty the unconstrained god the most powerful the most exalted the most great addresseth the holy beings created through the primal word that proceeded from his mouth and beyond them the concourse on high and beyond them those whom he hath sanctified above the comprehension of all who are on earth and in heaven and whom he hath raised up through his hidden and inscrutable will saying “rejoice in your very souls for the most auspicious time hath come and the hour hath struck round which revolve all the other hours foretold in the tablets of god the almighty the all glorious the most merciful and the hidden morn hath broken forth in this treasured name from the dayspring of divinity shedding its radiance upon all that hath been and all that shall be blessed be the lord of all bounty the source of this supernal grace the promised day of god is come he who is the manifestation of the adored one hath been established upon the throne of his name the all loving and the sun of his bounty hath cast its rays upon the seeing and seen alike wherefore renounce ye denizens of the realms of limitation that which ye possess adorn your temples with his glorious vesture and behold with untainted vision him who is the luminous beauty of god seated upon the throne of glory in his transcendent his almighty and all subduing sovereignty all praise be to the best beloved who hath revealed his hidden beauty with such manifest authority all days have attained their consummation in this most august of days and all hours in this noblest of hours and the unseen hath willed to confer every grace upon the inmates of earth and heaven to establish before all who are in the kingdoms of revelation and creation the manifestation of god and his loftiness and the sovereignty of god and his grandeur that his favour might be made complete unto his servants and his bounty fulfilled unto his creation and yet when once he appeared the eyes of all who had awaited him were dazzled save for those whom his might had protected and from whose sight he had lifted all worldly veils blessed then be he who hath been made manifest through the power of truth in this wondrous this shining vesture and when the appointed hour of his revelation struck on this promised day the veils of destiny were rent asunder and the divine decree was fulfilled with the departure of the luminary of the heaven of eternity from the city of baghdád this came to pass by reason of what the hands of the malicious had wrought against this light—a light that hath outshone every other in its sacred and wondrous splendour blessed then be he who hath sent down these twin revelations through his most great his most mighty sovereignty at the advent of this manifestation the realities of all created things were filled with joy and all seized the cup of ecstasy with the hands of longing and rapture and drank thereof the choicest wine for love of this beauty—a beauty that hath appeared through the power of truth arrayed with the ornament of god the sovereign the just the all wise blessed then be he who through this revelation hath attracted the hearts of the well favoured of the lord say this is the day for which the pen of the most high hath ordained no peer and whose like the denizens of the concourse on high and the realities of the prophets and messengers of god have never attained blessed then be he who hath made manifest this hallowed and sacred this mighty and wondrous day this is the day whereon the pillars of the throne trembled in their yearning for god to establish himself thereon the day whereon the foundations of the most lofty seat were stirred into motion blessed then be god the source of this rapture that hath seized the entire creation this is the day whereon the sun of beauty dawned above the horizon of the countenance of god the most exalted the most great and the clouds of bounty rained down and the trees of paradise yielded such fruits as god hath apportioned to them that turn unto him with radiant hearts in this dispensation blessed then be god who hath ordained this surpassing grace this is the day whereon the spirits departed from their bodies in their eagerness to behold the unveiled countenance of the ancient beauty blessed then be the one who hath manifested this mighty day this is the day whereon the most great spirit was embodied in the most comely of forms and proceeding from the realm on high approached the scene of transcendent glory with such radiance as to delight the maid of heaven until she paused suspended in the air before our presence with such an adorning as to seize with longing the hearts of the messengers of god blessed then be god who hath created this noble angel thereupon the inmates of paradise and beyond them the inhabitants of the retreats of holiness and the realms of communion and beyond them they that dwell within the habitations of heaven and they that abide beneath the tabernacle of concealment stepped forth one and all from their lofty mansions and conversing in hushed tones apprised one another of that which had come to pass upon the earth it was as though the ancient king had revealed himself unto himself and then with undisputed sovereignty unto his servants and his creatures in the realm of creation blessed then be god who bringeth forth whatsoever he pleaseth through the potency of his all compelling command then the most great spirit raised call that resounded through the entire creation saying “solaced be your eyes ye inhabitants of earth and heaven ye manifestations of the divine names and attributes and ye who are immersed beneath the oceans of grandeur that lie beyond the worlds of intimation and allusion this is the day whereon god himself the most exalted the most high through his own sacred and glorious self beareth round unto every soul high and low alike the cup of nearness and reunion blessed then be god who hath revealed himself in all his manifold grace on this greatest of all days this is the day whereon the most grievous veil was torn asunder and the scene of transcendent purity was made manifest the day whereon the face of god smiled with the joy of reunion and the gates of his presence were flung open to the embodiments of his beauty and majesty and to them that had pierced the veils of glory through the power born of god the almighty the all knowing the all wise the day whereon all things visible and invisible cried out “hallowed be the lord the most excellent of all creators whereupon the most great spirit was summoned to silence and the rapture of god seized the inhabitants of the cities of eternity the inmates of the crimson chambers and the dwellers of the kingdom of names one and all they descended from their habitations until they stood betwixt earth and heaven with utmost humility and submissiveness before his countenance blessed then be god who hath made manifest this resistless this all glorious and transcendent cause then were their voices lifted up in praise and exultation on this glorious day day whose radiance deriveth not from the sun and its rays but from the effulgent light of the countenance of god the king the exalted the all bountiful blessed then be he who hath caused it to appear through the power of truth and who hath resurrected therein the souls of all humankind and then another herald called out from the scene of transcendent glory “by god this is the day whereon the veils of contention were torn asunder and the breezes of unity were wafted and the lord of creation appeared invested with manifest sovereignty and riding upon the clouds of grandeur on this his promised day blessed then be god who hath descended in truth from the heaven of sublime holiness this is the day whereon fire and water were joined together as one and the veils were removed from the face of all mysteries inasmuch as the beauty of the unconstrained came forth arrayed in the raiment of his own self the help in peril the almighty the incomparable all glory be to this day whose advent hath cheered the eyes of the well favoured of god when that joy born of god had taken hold of all else besides him the most great spirit called out once more proclaiming “o ye dwellers of the kingdoms of earth and heaven ye denizens of the realms of revelation and creation blessed are your ears for they have hearkened unto the verses of nearness and reunion hear now the tidings of remoteness and separation for the luminary of the world hath purposed to depart from the land of ‘iráq in accordance with the firm covenant that hath been set forth in the scriptures of god the all powerful the all knowing the all wise at this announcement the dwellers of earth and heaven were filled with dismay such was their weeping and wailing that they fell prostrate upon the dust consumed with sorrow how strange that grievous and sore trying separation all things visible and invisible were bewildered by this call such was their plight that the letter “b” became oblivious of the letter “e” and the lovers forsook the face of their beloved the almighty the all praised how woeful was that manifest and irrevocable decree when matters came to such pass the ancient beauty bestirred himself and all things were inwardly and outwardly set in motion then he arose and through his arising the most great resurrection was ushered in betwixt earth and heaven whereupon the spirit called out once again before his presence “o isráfíl by the righteousness of god thou wert created for this day wherefore sound thy trumpet to proclaim the advent of this manifestation that every mouldering bone may be quickened thereby as bidden the angel sounded his trumpet causing all who dwell in heaven and on earth to swoon away then he sounded his trumpet anew they arose and fixing their gaze upon this glorious vision cried out “hallowed be the lord the most excellent of all creators the ancient beauty stepped forth while the kingdom of revelation preceded him and the heaven of divine inspiration followed in his wake on his right strode the realm of command and on his left marched the hosts of the well favoured ones all glory be to this manifest and wondrous cause and when he reached the courtyard of the house the concourse of the realm of holiness prostrated themselves at his feet and the foundations of the house trembled in their separation from god the all powerful the almighty the most exalted the inhabitants of every city cried out and the hearts of them that circle round god were sorely shaken how grievous that separation which caused the very pillars of the world to crumble upon hearing the lamentations of the inhabitants of the realm of dust the beauty of the all beloved lingered moment and the eye of majesty wept sore at their weeping indeed the sighs of his loved ones caused his heart to swell with such grief that none in the heavens or on the earth could bear its weight he proceeded until he reached the concealing veil and there at his feet he beheld child that had removed itself from its mother’s breast and this infant clung to the hem of his robe so earnestly and besought him in such piteous tones to stay that the dust of sorrow shrouded the face of every perceiving soul and the winds of anguish blew upon the entire creation how heavy the burden of grief that clouded the countenance of the sincere were it not for the protection of god the seven heavens would at that moment have been cleft asunder and the earth would have swallowed up all that dwell upon it and every lofty peak would have been reduced to dust the hand of power then parted the veil of grandeur whence the beauty of the all glorious emerged with supreme sovereignty when he who is the self of god the almighty the all bountiful purposed to pass through the gate the most great spirit made its final proclamation “by god the well beloved of the worlds hath departed from his house by reason of what the hands of the oppressors have wrought he then wept within himself with such weeping that the dwellers of earth and heaven and those suspended in the air before him and those circling round the countenance of grandeur wept with him and he spoke unto them saying “know ye that in such departure on the very day of our appearance there are signs and tokens for them that understand haply by reason of our departure on this most sublime and wondrous day the peoples of earth and heaven may emerge from behind the veils of self and passion draw nigh unto god the most exalted the all glorious and become detached from whatsoever he hath created or ordained in this world this is that which god had purposed for them as bounty from his presence he verily is the all bountiful the ever forgiving the most generous blessed then be god the source of this most manifest this most exalted bestowal the king of eternity went forth flanked by the hosts of the seen and the unseen with his gaze fixed upon the court of the divine decree before him arose the sighs of his lovers whilst behind him could be heard the lamentations of them that yearn after him when he reached the banks of the river he parted from his loved ones and it was as though the very souls of those devoted servants had parted from their bodies but he exhorted them to patience and fortitude and summoned them to the fear of god the all powerful the almighty the unconstrained and then crossing the river he entered the garden of riḍván wherein he ascended the throne of his wondrous sovereignty blessed then be the all bountiful the source of this all encompassing grace once seated on his throne the ancient beauty shed the splendour of his name the self subsisting upon all things so as to fulfil that which had been recorded by the supreme pen at the bidding of god the most exalted the most high then he cast the light of his name the all possessing upon all things seen and unseen and of his name the most manifest upon all that is mentioned and all that is concealed and of his name the most great upon the embodiments of eternity and all other peoples and of his name the all knowing upon the exponents of the names of god well is it with the one who hath turned towards that which he hath revealed through his unfailing grace on this most august day how glorious was his assumption of that seat of majesty through which the hearts of them that enjoy near access to him were assured and the souls of them that have recognized him drew nigh and the faces of them that have turned towards him were illumined and the spirits of them that have fixed their gaze upon him were sanctified and the eyes of the concourse on high were cheered and the tongues of all things visible and invisible were unloosed in praise of god the sovereign lord the mighty the gracious sweet indeed was that heavenly fragrance through which the musk of hidden meanings was scattered throughout the worlds the ancient beauty’s ascent upon his throne took place at the very moment the people arose to offer the afternoon prayer unto god the almighty the beauteous even in this there are signs for those who are well assured evidences for them that discern and allusions for such as have been endued with insight the beauty of the all merciful tarried in the garden of riḍván for twelve days during which the hosts of the concourse on high the well favoured angels of god and the souls of his messengers circled day and night round the tabernacle of grandeur and the pavilion of inviolable sanctity guarding and protecting the people of god from the hosts of the evil one blessed then be god who manifested this incomparable this glorious station during every moment of those days the inmates of the chambers of paradise descended from on high bearing chalices brimming over with the living waters of revelation and cups overflowing with the choice wine of holiness which they proffered unto the dwellers of the pavilion of glory and the inmates of the tabernacle of resplendent majesty blessed then be god for this most exalted this all encompassing grace and when the appointed time of tarrying was fulfilled and the decree of departure was received the beauty of the all merciful arose and went out from the riḍván garden riding upon the finest stallion blessed then be the all glorious who appeared in the world of creation with sovereignty that transcendeth the heavens and the earth as he departed cry of sorrow ascended from the garden and its trees and leaves and fruits and walls and air and ground and pavilion while the dwellers of the deserts and the wilderness and even the very dunes and the dust of the earth rejoiced at his approach thus did the beauty of the all glorious establish himself upon the lofty heights of eternity inasmuch as his gaze was fixed upon the decree which the finger of god the most exalted the most glorious had inscribed upon the blessed and snow white tablet and thus do we relate unto you the account of the day of our manifestation and the circumstances of our banishment by reason of the machinations of such seditious souls as had disbelieved in and joined partners with god the all powerful the almighty the most bountiful he is the manifest the hidden the all glorious the all knowing the ever forbearing lord my god whensoever attempt to unloose my tongue to extol the wondrous expressions of thy transcendent oneness or to open my lips to disclose the mystic gems of thine incomparable handiwork wherewith thou hast inspired me am compelled to recognize that all things sing thy praise and glorify thy remembrance—a remembrance which hath so pervaded the heavens and the earth that all things proclaim in their very being the wondrous testimonies of thine exalted praise and bear witness to the marvellous tokens of thy transcendent unity wherefore am ashamed as are all who mention thee to approach the exalted heights of thy remembrance and am powerless as are all who extol thee to ascend unto the lofty summits of thy praise glorified immeasurably glorified art thou so exalted are the wonders of thy bounty unto thy creatures that thou hast made all things to serve as sign unto the mindful amongst thy servants and as an admonishment unto the heedless amidst thy people thy glory beareth me witness they that are endued with true understanding can discern naught in all creation save the wondrous tokens of thy matchless handiwork nor behold aught else in the world of being but the hidden gems of thine all glorious sovereignty swear by thy glory my best beloved whensoever raise mine eyes to the heavens and witness their loftiness recognize naught therein but the wondrous heights of thy supreme power and sovereign authority and whensoever turn my gaze towards thine earth and observe the potentialities wherewith it hath been endowed perceive naught but the peerless signs of thine immutable nature and abiding constancy and whensoever my god behold the sea and its waves methinks hear the billowing ocean of thy wealth and power in the sun discern naught but the marvellous splendour of the light of thy hallowed countenance and presence and in the wind sense naught save the stirring breezes of thy nearness and reunion in the trees behold only the revelation of the fruits of thy wisdom and knowledge and in their leaves read but the pages of the books enshrining the mysteries of all that hath been through thy command or will be through thy power glorified then be thou my god am powerless as are all those who enjoy near access unto thee to reckon the least sign of thy creation inasmuch as thou hast made all things to mirror forth the manifestations of thy handiwork and the revelations of thy sovereign rule such being the bounds of powerlessness and poverty that confine me and all created things how then can any soul ever hope to approach the portals of the sanctuary of thy knowledge or conceive the least expectation of attaining the city of thy transcendent glory glorified immeasurably glorified art thou from everlasting thou hast been sanctified above the comprehension of thy creatures for this comprehension is naught but the product of such idle fancies as pertain to their own selves while thou hast remained in the reality of thine own self exalted above them and all that they possess and beyond the grasp of all that are in heaven and on earth there is none other god but thee the almighty the incomparable having acknowledged my god with my soul my tongue mine essence and with mine inner and outer being all my trespasses whose like mortal eyes have never beheld nor human minds conceived implore thee to pardon me and thy loved ones for whatsoever we have failed to observe of thy laws and ordinances attire us then with the robe of forgiveness my god in this day whereon thou hast assumed the throne of thy grace and bounty invested with the full glory of thy names and attributes the day whereon the sun of thy beauty hath dawned above the horizon of thy grandeur and the signs of thy glorious sovereignty have been vouchsafed from the treasury of thy grace the day whereon the sweet savours of reunion have wafted over all who are in thy heaven and on thine earth and the hidden word hath shone forth from the repository of thy protection and power bear witness my god that thou hast ordained this day to stand unequalled amongst all the days of thy world and unrivalled amidst all that thou hast fashioned through thy creative power this is that primal day which thou hast singled out from among all other days and exalted over all other times and appointed as the king of days unto all peoples inasmuch as thou didst manifest on this day the tokens of thy transcendent power and the evidences of thy holy unity thou hast caused its radiance to surpass the splendour of the sun the moon and the stars and to transcend the brightness of every lofty and glorious every shining and brilliant light nay thou hast illumined this day my best beloved with the very lights of thine own inaccessible being and with the full glory of thine own exalted essence magnified then be this day whereon thou hast revealed unto all things the effulgent lights of thy glorious unity and cast upon all creation the radiance of thy sovereign and transcendent oneness the day whereon thou hast lifted the veil of concealment from the countenance of thy beauty burned away through thy gracious favour the shrouds of idle fancy blinding the eyes of the people and summoned all to partake of thy nearness and reunion immensely glorified be this day whereon the oceans of splendour and grace have surged and the rivers of bounty and justice have flowed day whereon thy bounty hath attained such degree that every stammering tongue hath celebrated thy praise every blind eye hath beheld the lights of thy beauty and every deaf ear hath hearkened unto the glorious strains of the dove of thy oneness on this day the poor have been enriched through the wonders of thine incomparable wealth the abased have been exalted through the manifold revelations of thy majesty and glory the sinful have partaken of the wine of thy forgiveness the sick have quaffed from the waters of thy gracious healing the disconsolate have taken refuge beneath the shade of the tree of thy hope and bestowal and the destitute have attained the shores of the sea of thy grace and favour blind is the eye that faileth on this day to behold thee seated upon the throne of thy sovereignty or to witness thine undisputed authority over all that thou hast created to be the exponents of thy names and attributes can any of thy signs and tokens my god be confounded with those that pertain to thy creatures nay by thy glory whatsoever proceedeth from thee and from thy presence shineth as brightly as the noonday sun in the heaven of thy justice whilst all else even though it be among the treasures of thy creation or of the quintessence of thy handiwork fadeth into utter nothingness and inasmuch as thou hast assigned no partner unto thyself whatsoever is manifested from thee hath likewise no peer or equal and even though thou hast shed upon all created things the effulgent lights of thy sublime singleness and nothing proceedeth from anything except it be manifested from thee and be created at thy behest yet that which appeareth from thine own self excelleth and surpasseth all else in thy heavens and on thine earth and thus the tokens of thy glorious sovereignty are revealed before the eyes of men and thy testimony is fulfilled before all creation since thy bounty hath suffused the whole universe and the lights of thy countenance have illumined all created things beseech thee by this day and by the hearts which thou hast made to be the repositories of thy knowledge and inspiration and the treasuries of thy revelation and recognition to grant that the signs of thine undisputed ascendancy may shine above the horizon of thy command that the showers of thy surpassing mercy may rain from the heaven of thy grace and that the tokens of thy deliverance may appear through the operation of thy sovereign will thus may thy friends be released from the clutches of thy foes and thy loved ones delivered from the hands of the wayward among thy servants that they may extol thee lord with ringing voices in the supernal realms of thy names and worship thee with their entire beings in the kingdom of thine attributes and thus may thy name be exalted thy testimony established thy proof vindicated thy favour completed thy bounty fulfilled thy verses promulgated and thy signs expounded in such wise that the entire world may be filled with the light of thy countenance and all dominion may be thine alone no god is there but thee the omnipotent the almighty the all powerful the all compelling entreat thee moreover my god by thy name through which the bird of the celestial throne hath warbled in the realm of the unseen the melodies of thy transcendent unity and the dove of thy revelation hath sung forth in the kingdom of eternity the paeans of thy sovereign oneness and the holy spirit hath magnified in wondrous tones thine everlasting glory—i entreat thee not to withhold from these servants the gentle breezes of the morn of thy nearness and presence nor to suffer them to be far removed from the sweet savours of the dawn of thy reunion and recognition grant my god that this festival may be source of blessings for them and for all thy loved ones supply them then with all the good thou didst ordain in the heaven of thy decree and purpose and in the tablets of thy protection and behest vanquish then my god in the course of this year their enemies through the power of thy wrath and of thy resistless might and ordain for them my god all that have asked of thee and all that have left unasked endue them then with such constancy in thy love and in thy cause that they may never break thy covenant nor violate thy testament to which they pledged themselves ere the creation of the heavens and the earth render them victorious through the most wondrous means that lie hid in the treasuries of thy power and the repositories of thy might and grant them my god to attain the hour thou didst promise them in thy latter resurrection through the appearance of the manifestation of thine all glorious self—for this in truth is the very object of their existence and the existence of all things the cause of their creation and the creation of all things suffer them then my god to submit to thy will under all conditions verily thou art the lord of grace and bounty of endless bestowal and unfettered sovereignty and thou art verily the most exalted the almighty the all bountiful beg thee moreover my god by all the exponents of thy names and all the revealers of thine attributes not to number these thy servants with those who outwardly observe the festivals associated with the advent of thy manifestation who honour and glorify these days as beseemeth their means and abilities and yet who remain shut out as by veil from the one who is through his command and decree the author of these observances and of all else for thus will all their works be rendered vain even though they perceive it not implore thee my god by the appearance of him whom thou hast manifested in these days through thy name “he who is invoked” and by his beauty and his majesty and the afflictions he hath been made to suffer and his divine fragrances and his sweet accents and his grandeur and his might to grant that the eyes of thy loved ones may be freed from the veils of ignorance and blindness and from the obscuring mists of doubt and wretchedness perchance they may fix their gaze upon the tree of thy revelation and upon that which appeareth thereon of the wondrous leaves of thine ancient eternity and the precious fruits of thy holy unity may take delight in them and in that which they contain of thy hidden gifts and concealed knowledge and may rid themselves thereby of attachment to aught else this verily is but perfect grace and unalloyed blessing and the very essence origin and ultimate abode thereof for within the compass of thy knowledge there is naught higher than this grace nor sweeter than this blessing thou verily art the king the omniscient the omnipotent the almighty the all

lest ye follow in the footsteps of every veiled and heedless soul thus the summons of the pen regarding this blessed and fated account endeth in this tablet he is the ever abiding it is the festival

another letter of thine which made mention of the hallowed and blessed days of riḍván was received praise be to god there wafted therefrom the sweet savours of the rose garden of true knowledge and inner meaning should the people of the world resolve one and all to extol the days that we passed in the garden of najíb páshá which hath been designated as the garden of riḍván they would find themselves utterly incapable thereof and would confess to their powerlessness verily the eye of creation hath never beheld the light of those days nor hath the gaze of humankind ever witnessed their

ennobled by his footsteps how much less to his mighty throne his manifest establishment thereon and his pervasive and all embracing utterance indeed the splendours of that day elude the understanding and comprehension of the peoples of the world that garden hath been named after its caretaker who was called riḍván those were the days whereon the all merciful cast the splendour of all his names over all who are in his heaven and on his earth some among his chosen ones had the honour of witnessing those days and beholding that which was manifested therein in the arrival and departure of the

flee from the mercy of god after it hath pervaded all that is in the heavens and on the earth barter not away that mercy wherewith god hath favoured you nor withhold yourselves therefrom for they that

with the faithful in these days—days wherein none may attain certitude nor achieve constancy in the cause of god save by renouncing that which is current amongst men and by turning towards this hallowed and refulgent beauty people will ye take false deity for your helper rather than god will ye follow the most great idol before your lord the almighty the most powerful forsake their mention

rid thyself of all attachment to the world may his spirit rest upon thee and upon them that abide within the habitation of holiness and that are endued with true constancy in the cause of their lord lawḥ rasúl tablet to rasúl verily am the one who abideth disconsolate beneath the canopy of this world rasúl shouldst thou ask concerning the sun of the heaven of inner meaning know that it hath been eclipsed by the clouds of envy and shouldst thou enquire regarding the moon of the realm of everlasting holiness be apprised that it hath been obscured by the shrouds of hatred and shouldst thou search after the star of the firmament of unseen reality be informed that it hath sunk below the horizon of malice behold lone ḥusayn assailed by hundred thousand deadly foes behold solitary abraham compassed by myriad tyrant kings behold one stainless soul that vast multitudes aim to seize behold one single throat that countless daggers seek to pierce not single night in mine earthly life did find rest not single day was granted repose at one time my severed head was sent as trophy from land to land at another was suspended in the air at one time had for boon companion him who dealt me fatal blow at another had for close associate him who profaned my remains every morn as arose from my bed fresh affliction awaited me and every eve as repaired to the solitude of my chamber sore trial was in store in the succession of my woes there was no reprieve and in the onslaught of my sorrows there was no respite notwithstanding all this stood against mine enemies manifest as the sun and appeared before the dwellers of the heavenly kingdom bright as the moon not for an instant did seek to preserve mine own life and not for moment did pursue mine own ease and comfort offered up my soul in the path of my beloved and laid down my life for his sake my fortress was my reliance on god and my shield mine attachment to that peerless friend mine armour was mine unfailing trust in him and my hosts mine ardent hope in his grace at length my revelation aroused the envy of my foes and elicited the rancour of the malicious my rasúl wert thou to gaze with keen and discerning eye thou wouldst behold all things—yea verily even the denizens of the realm on high—sharing in mine anguish and sorrow rasúl the oppressive gloom of satanic envy hath concealed the resplendent morn of the spirit and the darksome veils of malice have obscured the refulgent rays of the day star of eternal holiness at this present hour the ancient king hath purposed to take leave of this wayward people yet none knoweth whether even after his departure this essence of god’s mercy will be spared the sting of these venomous serpents as was clearly witnessed after his first banishment rasúl canst thou perceive the plight of this wronged and banished soul who findeth himself sore tried by two contending peoples and who hath neither the pity of his foes nor the compassion of his friends swear by my beauty that the afflictions suffer at the hands of mine enemies are hundred thousand times easier to bear render thanks unto god that thou art not fully acquainted with the condition of him who is the eternal king and that which he hath been made to suffer these indeed are days whose like the eye of creation hath never seen strive then that thou mayest forsake the path of illusion and imitation and gain admittance into the realm of inner vision and the kingdom of spiritual discoveries for in these days all are bewildered in the drunkenness of ignorance save those whom thy lord hath willed to spare some consider the fading mirage to be the billowing ocean and reckon the impenetrable darkness as the radiant morn others having forsaken the river of eternal life content themselves with vanishing drop such is the state and condition of the people “thus have we created the souls in divers conditions as to thee rasúl shouldst thou wish to take flight in the atmosphere of my love it behoveth thee to soar above the kingdoms of earth and heaven and all that they contain that thou mayest attain the paradise of the good pleasure of the all glorious well is it with them that have entered therein lawḥ maryam tablet to maryam sorrowful is he at my sorrows maryam the wrongs which suffer have blotted out the wrongs suffered by my first name from the tablet of creation the clouds of divine decree have at every moment rained down upon this manifest beauty the showers of tribulation my banishment from my homeland was for the sake of none but the beloved my exile was in no other path save that of his good pleasure in the midst of heaven sent trials glowed bright as candle and in the face of divinely ordained afflictions stood as firm as mountain in manifesting the outpourings of his grace was even as bounteous cloud and in laying hold on the foes of the peerless king was even as burning flame the clear tokens of my power roused the envy of my foes and the compelling evidences of my wisdom stirred the hatred of the malevolent not single night did repose in peace not single morn did awake in tranquillity swear by the beauty of god that ḥusayn shed tears of anguish at the wrongs suffered and abraham cast himself into the flames for the sake of the afflictions sustained wert thou to gaze with discernment thou wouldst behold the eye of grandeur weeping sore beneath the tabernacle of sanctity and the essence of majesty lamenting within the realms of loftiness unto this beareth witness the tongue of truth and glory maryam from the land of ṭá after countless afflictions we reached ‘iráq at the bidding of the tyrant of persia where after the fetters of our foes we were afflicted with the perfidy of our friends god knoweth what befell me thereafter at length abandoning my home and all that was therein and renouncing my life and all that pertained thereunto retired alone and companionless roamed the wilderness of resignation travelling in such wise that in my exile every eye wept sore over me and all created things shed tears of blood because of my anguish the birds of the air were my companions and the beasts of the field my associates in such wise did even as the flash of the spirit pass over this fleeting world for two years or rather less shunned all else but god and closed mine eyes to all except him that haply the fire of hatred may die down and the heat of jealousy abate maryam to divulge the heavenly secrets would be unbefitting and to disclose the celestial mysteries would be unseemly by “secrets” is meant naught other than the treasuries enshrined within mine own being by the righteousness of god have borne what no man be he of the past or of the future hath borne or will bear during this period of retirement none whether among my brothers or any other soul sought to investigate the matter let alone to grasp its significance though its import surpasseth the creation of earth and heaven and yet swear by god every breath drawn in the course of my journey was better than the service of both worlds and my very retreat was the mightiest testimony and the most perfect and conclusive evidence yea true vision is needed if one is to behold the scene of transcendent glory inasmuch as the blind one is deprived of beholding his own countenance much less the countenance of eternal holiness how can mere shadow comprehend the one who casteth it how can handful of clay grasp the subtle reality of the heart at last the divine decree prompted certain spiritual souls to remember this canaanite youth armed with number of petitions they searched in every place and enquired from every person until they found in mountain cave trace of this traceless one he verily guideth all things unto the straight path swear by the day star of eternal truth that the arrival of these souls so astonished and amazed this poor and exiled soul that my pen is powerless to describe it perchance steel sharp pen will emerge from the realm of eternity rend the veils asunder and reveal these secrets with perfect truth and absolute sincerity or haply an eloquent tongue will speak and bring forth the pearls of the spirit from the shell of silence and this indeed would not be hard of accomplishment for god in brief the hand of him who is the unconstrained broke the seal of the mysteries—this however none can perceive save them that are endued with true understanding nay rather them that have severed themselves from all things so it was that the luminary of the world returned to ‘iráq where we found no more than handful of souls faint and dispirited nay utterly lost and dead the cause of god had ceased to be on any one’s lips nor was any heart receptive to its message this lowly servant arose then with such vigour to protect and promote the cause of god that methinks new resurrection was ushered in the glory of the cause became manifest in every town and its fair name exalted in every city to such an extent that all the rulers treated it with tolerance and benevolence maryam the determination evinced by this servant to withstand the onslaught of his foes from every sect and kindred so deepened their rancour that it can scarcely be depicted or imagined thus was it ordained by the lord of might and power maryam the pen of the ancient of days proclaimeth among the foremost duties prescribed is to cleanse one’s heart of all but god sanctify then thy heart from aught save the friend that thou mayest be made worthy to enter the court of communion maryam free thyself from the fetters of blind imitation that thou mayest gain admittance into the blissful realm of detachment sever thy heart from the world and all that is therein that thou mayest attain to the sovereign rule of faith and be not debarred from the sanctuary of the all merciful through the power of renunciation rend asunder the veil of idle fancy and enter the hallowed retreats of certitude maryam though tree be laden with myriad leaves and fruits gust of autumnal wind sufficeth to obliterate them all remove not then thy gaze from the very root of the tree of divinity and the branch of the lote tree of celestial glory consider the ocean how serene it lieth how majestically it reposeth within its bed yet the winds of the will of the eternal beloved cause countless ripples and innumerable swells to appear upon its surface each wave distinct and divergent from the others all the peoples of the world today are preoccupied with the ebb and flow of these waves and are oblivious of the stupendous might of that sea of seas whose every movement layeth bare the signs of him who is the unconstrained commune maryam with the spirit of the all merciful and shunning the company and kinship of the evil one seek shelter within the inviolable protection of the lord of bounty that haply the hand of his loving kindness may deliver thee from the path of selfish pursuits and direct thy steps towards the realm of transcendent glory abandon these fleeting shadows maryam and turn towards the day star of unfading splendour every shadow oweth its existence and motion to the presence of the sun for were the latter to withhold its grace for single moment all things would sink beneath the veil of non existence how sad and regrettable indeed that one should occupy oneself with the transitory things of this world and be debarred from the dayspring of eternal holiness maryam appreciate the value of these days for erelong thou shalt no longer behold the celestial youth in this contingent realm but shalt perceive the signs of grief in all created things soon shall ye bite your fingers’ ends in remorse for ye shall fail to find this youth even were ye to search out the reaches of earth and heaven thus hath the decree been sent down from the realm of transcendent glory yea erelong thou shalt behold all existence biting its fingers in bereavement over this youth and search as it may through the entirety of every earth and every heaven yet will it fail to attain his presence in brief matters have come to such pass that this servant hath resolved to retire alone from the midst of this wretched people apart from the women of the household who must needs remain with me shall admit no one else to our company not even the attendants of my consort let us see then what god hath purposed depart whilst my companions are the tears shed and mine associates the sighs utter my solace is my pen and the delight of my soul is mine own beauty my hosts are my reliance upon god and mine armies are my trust in him thus have we imparted unto thee measure of the mysteries of this matter that thou mayest be of them that apprehend maryam all the waters of the world and its rivers have flowed from the eyes of this youth which even as the clouds have rained down their tears at the wrongs he hath suffered in short we have ever offered up our life and soul in the path of the beloved and we are thankful and content in the face of whatever may befall us at one time my head was raised aloft on spear and at another it fell into the hands of my deadly enemy at one time was cast into the fire and at another was suspended in the air such indeed hath been the treatment that the ungodly have meted out to us maryam we have called this tablet “the choicest of lamentations” and “the vernal shower of tears” we have dispatched it unto thee that thou mayest weep at thy heart’s ease and share in the agonies and afflictions of the ancient beauty kitáb ‘ahd book of the covenant although the realm of glory hath none of the vanities of the world yet within the treasury of trust and resignation we have bequeathed to our heirs an excellent and priceless heritage earthly treasures we have not bequeathed nor have we added such cares as they entail by god in earthly riches fear is hidden and peril is concealed consider ye and call to mind that which the all merciful hath revealed in the qur’án “woe betide every slanderer and defamer him that layeth up riches and counteth them fleeting are the riches of the world all that perisheth and changeth is not and hath never been worthy of attention except to recognized measure the aim of this wronged one in sustaining woes and tribulations in revealing the holy verses and in demonstrating proofs hath been naught but to quench the flame of hate and enmity that the horizon of the hearts of men may be illumined with the light of concord and attain real peace and tranquillity from the dawning place of the divine tablet the day star of this utterance shineth resplendent and it behoveth everyone to fix his gaze upon it we exhort you peoples of the world to observe that which will elevate your station hold fast to the fear of god and firmly adhere to what is right verily say the tongue is for mentioning what is good defile it not with unseemly talk god hath forgiven what is past henceforward everyone should utter that which is

commander have ever been and are an upright character and pure and goodly deeds say servants let not the means of order be made the cause of confusion and the instrument of union an occasion for discord we fain would hope that the people of bahá may be guided by the blessed words “say all things are of god this exalted utterance is like unto water for quenching the fire of hate and enmity which smouldereth within the hearts and breasts of men by this single utterance contending peoples and kindreds will attain the light of true unity verily he speaketh the truth and leadeth the way he

hath dawned from thy most august self and the glory which hath shone forth from thy most effulgent beauty rest upon thee thou who art the manifestation of grandeur and the king of eternity and the lord of all who are in heaven and on earth testify that through thee the sovereignty of god and his dominion and the majesty of god and his grandeur were revealed and the day stars of ancient splendour have shed their radiance in the heaven of thine irrevocable decree and the beauty of the unseen hath shone forth above the horizon of creation testify moreover that with but movement of thy pen thine injunction “be thou” hath been enforced and god’s hidden secret hath been divulged and all created things have been called into being and all the revelations have been sent down bear witness moreover that through thy beauty the beauty of the adored one hath been unveiled and through thy face the face of the desired one hath shone forth and that through word from thee thou hast decided between all created things causing them who are devoted to thee to ascend unto the summit of glory and the infidels to fall into the lowest abyss bear witness that he who hath known thee hath known god and he who hath attained unto thy presence hath attained unto the presence of god great therefore is the blessedness of him who hath believed in thee and in thy signs and hath humbled himself before thy sovereignty and hath been honoured with meeting thee and hath attained the good pleasure of thy will and circled around thee and stood before thy throne woe betide him that hath transgressed against thee and hath denied thee and repudiated thy signs and gainsaid thy sovereignty and risen up against thee and waxed proud before thy face and hath disputed thy testimonies and fled from thy rule and thy dominion and been numbered with the infidels whose names have been inscribed by the fingers of thy behest upon thy holy tablets waft then unto me my god and my beloved from the right hand of thy mercy and thy loving kindness the holy breaths of thy favours that they may draw me away from myself and from the world unto the courts of thy nearness and thy presence potent

witness that the eye of creation hath never gazed upon one wronged like thee thou wast immersed all the days of thy life beneath an ocean of tribulations at one time thou wast in chains and fetters at another thou wast threatened by the sword of thine enemies yet despite all this thou didst enjoin upon all men to observe what had been prescribed unto thee by him who is the all knowing the all wise may my spirit be sacrifice to the wrongs thou didst suffer and my soul be ransom for the adversities thou didst sustain beseech god by thee and by them whose faces have been illumined with the splendours of the light of thy countenance and who for love of thee have observed all whereunto they were bidden to remove the veils that have come in between thee and thy creatures and to supply me with the good of this world and the world to come thou art in truth the almighty the most exalted the all glorious the ever forgiving the most compassionate bless thou lord my god the divine lote tree

nations he hath sent his messengers whom he hath commissioned to announce unto men tidings of the paradise of his good pleasure and to draw them nigh unto the haven of abiding security the seat of eternal holiness and transcendent glory some were guided by the light of god gained admittance into the court of his presence and quaffed from the hand of resignation the waters of everlasting life and were accounted of them that have truly recognized and believed in him others rebelled against him and rejected the signs of god the most powerful the almighty the all wise ages rolled away until they attained their consummation in this the lord of days the day whereon the day star of the bayán manifested itself above the horizon of mercy the day in which the beauty of the all glorious shone forth in the exalted person of ‘alí muḥammad the báb no sooner did he reveal himself than all the people rose up against him by some he was denounced as one that hath uttered slanders against god the almighty the ancient of days others regarded him as man smitten with madness an allegation which myself have heard from the lips of one of the divines still others disputed his claim to be the mouthpiece of god and stigmatized him as one who had stolen and used as his the words of the almighty who had perverted their meaning and mingled them with his own the eye of grandeur weepeth sore for the things which their mouths have uttered while they continue to rejoice upon their seats “god” said he “is my witness people am come to you with revelation from the lord your god the lord of your fathers of old look not people at the things ye possess look rather at the things god hath sent down unto you this surely will be better for you than the whole of creation could ye but perceive it repeat the gaze people and consider the testimony of god and his proof which are in your possession and compare them unto the revelation sent down unto you in this day that the truth the infallible truth may be indubitably manifested unto you follow not people the steps of the evil one follow ye the faith of the all merciful and be ye of them that truly believe what would it profit man if he were to fail to recognize the revelation of god nothing whatever to this mine own self the omnipotent the omniscient the all wise will testify the more he exhorted them the fiercer grew their enmity till at the last they put him to death with shameful cruelty the curse of god be upon the oppressors few believed in him few of our servants are the thankful these he admonished in all his tablets—nay in every passage of his wondrous writings—not to give themselves up in the day of the promised revelation to anything whatever be it in the heaven or in the earth “o people said he “i have revealed myself for his manifestation and have caused my book the bayán to descend upon you for no other purpose except to establish the truth of his cause fear ye god and contend not with him as the people of the qur’án have contended with me at whatever time ye hear of him hasten ye towards him and cleave ye to whatsoever he may reveal unto you naught else besides him can ever profit you no not though ye produce from first to last the testimonies of all those who were before you and when after the lapse of few years the heaven of divine decree was cleft asunder and the beauty of the báb appeared in the clouds of the names of god arrayed in new raiment these same people maliciously rose up against him whose light embraceth all created things they broke his covenant rejected his truth contended with him cavilled at his signs treated his testimony as falsehood and joined the company of the infidels eventually they determined to take away his life such is the state of them who are in far gone error and when they realized their powerlessness to achieve their purpose they arose to plot against him witness how every moment they devise fresh device to harm him that they may injure and dishonour the cause of god say woe be to you by god your schemings cover you with shame your lord the god of mercy can well dispense with all creatures nothing whatever can either increase or diminish the things he doth possess if ye believe to your own behoof will ye believe and if ye believe not ye yourselves will suffer at no time can the hand of the infidel profane the hem of his robe my servant that believest in god by the righteousness of the almighty were to recount to thee the tale of the things that have befallen me the souls and minds of men would be incapable of sustaining its weight god himself beareth me witness watch over thyself and follow not the footsteps of these people meditate diligently upon the cause of thy lord strive to know him through his own self and not through others for no one else besides him can ever profit thee to this all created things will testify couldst thou but perceive it emerge from behind the veil by the leave of thy lord the all glorious the most powerful and seize before the eyes of those who are in the heavens and those who are on the earth the chalice of immortality in the name of thy lord the inaccessible the most high and quaff thy fill and be not of them that tarry swear by god the moment thou touchest the cup with thy lips the concourse on high will acclaim thee saying “drink with healthy relish man that hast truly believed in god and the inhabitants of the cities of immortality will cry out “joy be to thee thou that hast drained the cup of his love and the tongue of grandeur will hail thee “great is the blessedness that awaiteth thee my servant for thou hast attained unto that which none hath attained except such as have detached themselves from all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth and who are the emblems of true detachment excerpt from the súriy nuṣḥ súrih of counsel announce unto my servants the advent of the one who came unto them with the power of truth bearing the name of ‘alí who dawned above the horizon of holiness with the splendours of cherished glory and from whose right hand flowed the crystal streams of the spirit laying bare the wonders of hidden knowledge “o people he declared “the clouds of wisdom have been lifted and god hath revealed his cause this is that which ye were promised in all the scriptures fear ye god and hasten unto me am people scion of your prophet have brought unto you verses that bewilder the minds of them that perceive and this is but token of god’s proof and testimony deny them not at the prompting of your idle fancies and be fair in your judgement they verily proceed from the religion of god that hath been sent down unto you through the power of truth would that ye might believe “i swear by god people wish only to rid your religions of all that hath in this day become the cause of contention these verses people are the breezes of the spirit that are wafting over you and would transmute your mortal condition into eternal life could ye but fix your gaze upon them people the tree of knowledge hath yielded its fruit upon this everlasting lote tree the primal point hath been unfolded and the word of god the help in peril the self subsisting hath been fulfilled people the beauty of his countenance hath been revealed the veils have been parted the nightingale hath warbled its melody the mount of holiness hath been made resplendent and all who are in the heavens and on the earth have been illumined could ye but see with the eye of the spirit but the people made reply saying “we deem thee speaker of falsehood nor do we discern in thine acts that which we had been promised in the books of our forefathers never would we follow thee even wert thou to produce for us all the signs of the world “o concourse of men he declared “fear ye god and consider that which he hath ordained to be his immutable proof and abiding testimony unto all that dwell in the heavens and on the earth did ye but know it people the truth of all that ye have been awaiting and all that ye have heard from your forefathers and your divines is established only through these verses and these verily are the verses of holiness that have been vouchsafed unto all who are in the heavens and on the earth even as ye yourselves can behold “if ye believe not in these verses how then can ye be assured of the truth of your own religion in this day or establish it in the eyes of others the day is fast approaching when the world and all that it containeth will have perished and when ye shall stand in the holy court of his presence take heed people lest ye be swayed by the elaborate pronouncements of your divines or misconceive the truth of the matter hearken unto my counsels and repudiate not the exhortations of god the more he extolled the remembrance of god the greater they waxed in their oppression until all the divines pronounced sentence against him save those that were acquainted with the precepts of god the all glorious the best beloved matters came to such pass that they united to put him to death they suspended him in the air and the hosts of misbelief flung at him the bullets of malice and hatred piercing the body of the one unto whom the holy spirit is humble servant the dust of whose feet is the object of adoration of the concourse on high and from whose very sandals the inmates of paradise seek blessing whereupon the inhabitants of the unseen realm wept sore beneath the pavilion of eternity the pillars of the throne trembled the inmost realities of all things were stirred into commotion and the divine tree received its full measure of his gleaming blood which was shed upon the earth erelong will god reveal the mystery of this tree make it to flourish through the power of truth and cause it to intone “verily am god there is none other god but him all are my servants whom we have created to carry out my bidding and by my bidding they all verily abide this in truth is that which we pledged ourself aforetime to accomplish to show favour unto those who were brought low in the land and to humble them that have waxed proud at no time did we send an apostle prophet or vicegerent whom these wicked souls did not oppose even as ye witness how these workers of iniquity are raising objections in this day nor have the people ever rejected the truth except after their divines rejected it and swelled with pride before god and sought to dispute his verses thus did the rejection of the leaders give rise to the rejection of those who followed them in their selfish desires none among these divines ever bore allegiance unto the new revelation save for those who could gaze with the eye of holiness whose hearts god had tested and proved true for his recognition to whom he hath given to drink from that chalice of holiness sealed with the musk of the spirit and who were intoxicated by the wine of certitude which they had quaffed from that chalice these verily are they whom the angels of paradise will glorify in the garden of eternity and who will delight at every moment in joy and gladness born of god no prophet have we ever raised up except that he was repudiated by the divines whilst they prided themselves in their learning even as they do in this day say concourse of divines do ye worship the calf and abandon the one who hath created you and taught you that which ye knew not people of the earth ponder the state of these workers of iniquity what they have wrought in the past and what they pursue in this day say if he who hath come unto you with clear verses be not the true one from god even as ye proclaim this day from your seats of worldly honour then by what proof can ye establish the truth of muḥammad whom we sent aforetime be fair in your judgement concourse of ill wishers excerpt from the súriy mulúk súrih of the kings dost thou imagine minister of thesháh in the city that hold within my grasp the ultimate destiny of the cause of god thinkest thou that my imprisonment or the shame have been made to suffer or even my death and utter annihilation can deflect its course wretched is what thou hast imagined in thine heart thou art indeed of them that walk after the vain imaginings which their hearts devise no god is there but him powerful is he to manifest his cause and to exalt his testimony and to establish whatsoever is his will and to elevate it to so eminent position that neither thine own hands nor the hands of them that have turned away from him can ever touch or harm it dost thou believe thou hast the power to frustrate his will to hinder him from executing his judgement or to deter him from exercising his sovereignty pretendest thou that aught in the heavens or in the earth can resist his faith nay by him who is the eternal truth nothing whatsoever in the whole of creation can thwart his purpose cast away therefore the mere conceit thou dost follow for mere conceit can never take the place of truth be thou of them that have truly repented and returned to god the god who hath created thee who hath nourished thee and made thee minister among them that profess thy faith know thou moreover that he it is who hath by his own behest created all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth how can then the thing that hath been created at his bidding prevail against him high is god exalted above what ye imagine about him ye people of malice if this cause be of god no man can prevail against it and if it be not of god the divines amongst you and they that follow their corrupt desires and such as have rebelled against him will surely suffice to overpower it hast thou not heard what man of the family of pharaoh believer hath said of old and which god recounted unto his apostle whom he hath chosen above all human beings and entrusted with his message and made the source of his mercy unto all them that dwell on earth he said and he verily speaketh the truth “will ye slay man because he saith my lord is god when he hath already come to you with proofs of his mission and if he be liar on him will be his lie but if he be man of truth part at least of what he threateneth will fall upon you this is what god hath revealed unto his well beloved one in his unerring book and yet ye have failed to incline your ears unto his bidding have disregarded his law have rejected his counsel as recorded in his book and have been of them that have strayed far from him how many those who every year and every month have because of you been put to death how manifold the injustices ye have perpetrated—injustices the like of which the eye of creation hath not seen which no chronicler hath ever recorded how numerous the babes and sucklings who were made orphans and the fathers who lost their sons because of your cruelty ye unjust doers how oft hath sister pined away and mourned over her brother and how oft hath wife lamented after her husband and sole sustainer your iniquity waxed greater and greater until ye slew him who had never taken his eyes away from the face of god the most exalted the most great would that ye had put him to death after the manner men are wont to put one another to death ye slew him however in such circumstances as no man hath ever witnessed the heavens wept sore over him and the souls of them who are nigh unto god cried out for his affliction was he not scion of your prophet’s ancient house had not his fame as direct descendant of the apostle been spread abroad amongst you why then did ye inflict upon him what no man however far ye may look back hath inflicted upon another by god the eye of creation hath never beheld your like ye slay him who is scion of your prophet’s house and rejoice and make merry while seated on your seats of honour ye utter your imprecations against them who were before you and who have perpetrated what ye have perpetrated and remain yourselves all the time unaware of your enormities be fair in your judgement did they whom ye curse upon whom ye invoke evil act differently from yourselves have they not slain the descendant of their prophet as ye have slain the descendant of your own is not your conduct similar to their conduct wherefore then claim ye to be different from them ye sowers of dissension amongst men and when ye took away his life one of his followers arose to avenge his death he was unknown of men and the design he had conceived was unnoticed by any one eventually he committed what had been preordained it behoveth you therefore to attach blame to no one except to yourselves for the things ye have committed if ye but judge fairly who is there on the whole earth who hath done what ye have done none by him who is the lord of all worlds excerpt from the lawḥ salmán tablet to salmán salmán say people tread ye in the path of the one true god and ponder the ways and words of him who is the manifestation of his ancient being that perchance ye may attain unto the wellspring of the living waters of the all glorious were believers and non believers to occupy the same station were the worlds of god to be confined to this ephemeral plane never would my previous manifestation have surrendered himself into the hands of his foes or laid down his life as sacrifice swear by the dawning light of this cause that were the people to grasp the barest intimation of the fervour and longing which overcame that sovereign beauty when his celestial temple was suspended in the air all would in the intensity of their own yearning offer up their souls in the path of this manifestation of supernal glory indeed sugar is the portion of the parrot while dung is the share of the beetle the crow hath no part in the warbling of the nightingale and the bat fleeth the rays of the sun excerpt from the súriy dhikr súrih of remembrance this is the súrih of remembrance sent down as token of grace that perchance the people of the bayán might renounce that which they possess turn towards the right hand of justice shake off the slumber of wayward desires and seek through the power of truth path to their lord the most exalted the all glorious in the name of god the most holy the most exalted the most high this is missive from the primal point unto them that have believed in god the one the peerless the almighty the all knowing wherein he addresseth those among the people of the bayán who have vacillated in this cause that haply they may apprehend the wondrous words of god and forsake the couch of heedlessness in this shining and resplendent morn say we verily bid you in our book not to advance yourselves before those from whose ranks would appear he who is the beloved of every understanding heart and the object of the adoration of the denizens of earth and heaven moreover we commanded you should ye attain the presence of god to stand before him and to utter on my behalf these mighty and exalted words “upon thee glory of god and upon thy kinfolk be the remembrance of god and the praise of all things at every moment before and after ḥín we honoured the people of the bayán with these words that they might ascend thereby unto the heights of holiness and be numbered with the blest yet they have so utterly forsaken our injunction that not single one among them hath appeared in his presence as we had commanded in our tablets nay rather from every side they have hurled at him the darts of malice and at this and the denizens of the kingdom of grandeur and beyond them the faithful spirit have wept sore say people be abashed before my beauty he that hath appeared with the power of truth is indeed the glory of the worlds could ye but perceive it he verily is the glory of god upon him be the remembrance of god and his praise and the praise of the concourse on high and of the dwellers of the everlasting realm and of all things at all times beware lest ye become veiled by aught that hath been created in heaven or on earth hasten unto the paradise of his good pleasure and be not of them that slumber say his beauty is in truth my beauty and his self is mine own self and all that we revealed in the bayán is for the sake of his wondrous and resistless cause fear ye god and dispute not with the one whose advent we heralded and whose revelation we announced unto you established covenant with you concerning his mission ere covenanted with you regarding mine own and unto this all things bear witness even if ye were to deny it by the righteousness of god through but single one of his melodies the realities of all things were reborn and through another the hearts of his favoured ones were filled with rapture take heed lest anything debar you from him whose presence is the same as mine own he sacrificed himself in my path even as sacrificed myself in his path for the love of his glorious and incomparable beauty say but for him the word “love” would never have been written nor would the letters of the name of the beloved have been joined together nor would creation itself have been brought into being would that ye might understand but for him would never have surrendered myself into the hands of the ungodly nor consented to be suspended in the air by god have borne in my love and yearning for him that which no other prophet or messenger hath borne and have acquiesced to bear all this myself that he might never be made to endure aught that would sadden his most kind and tender his most pure and sanctified heart we admonished you throughout the bayán not to be the cause of grief to any soul that haply no sorrow should ever befall him otherwise why would have exhorted you and occupied myself with your care assemblage of wavering ones intended in the bayán none other than him extolled no praise but his praise and uttered no name save his most blessed and most exalted his most holy and most wondrous name swear by my life if have made mention of “lordship” have intended only his lordship over all things if the word “divinity” hath ever flowed from my pen have intended naught but his divinity in relation to the world and if an allusion to the “desired one” hath proceeded therefrom have had none other in mind than him so too in regard to the word “beloved” he indeed is my beloved and the beloved of every understanding heart if have spoken of “prostration” have meant only prostration before his exalted his glorious and sublime countenance if have praised any soul mine aim hath only been to celebrate his praise and if have bidden the people to act my sole purpose hath been that they should act in accordance with his good pleasure on the day of his manifestation unto this beareth witness whatsoever was sent down unto me from the kingdom of my lord the all knowing the all wise have made all things conditional upon his approval and pleasure he it is in truth who is the lord of the worlds and the object of the desire of every searching soul were ye to open your eyes ye would verily behold the manifestations of “he doeth whatsoever he willeth” worshipping under his shadow yet ye have done to him what even the people of the qur’án dared not do to myself nor the jews to christ alas alas my heart is consumed with anguish and my soul groaneth at what hath befallen my beloved at the hands of the infidels woe unto you for your faithlessness concourse of oppressors we verily created faithfulness and courtesy for his sake that perchance ye would not commit in the time of his appearance aught that would cause mine inner reality and the realities of all things to lament but ye have transgressed that which was laid down in the book of god the king the most exalted the most great ye have rent asunder the veil of restraint and cast aside the vesture of propriety and ye have committed that which the pen of creation is abashed to recount before the dwellers of earth and heaven alas alas for that which ye have inflicted upon this wronged this banished and forsaken soul nor do know what ye will inflict upon him hereafter nay by myself the all knowing do verily know for with me is the knowledge of all things in tablet that god hath shielded from the gaze of those who have joined partners with him we apprised him aforetime of the things that have befallen or will befall him even though he himself is well informed of all that the hearts of men conceal for nothing can escape his knowledge and whatever hath been created by mere word from his mouth can never slip from his grasp no god is there but him the peerless the creator the quickener the destroyer say people should it be his desire to cause all the dwellers of earth and heaven to become an abiding testimony of his truth this would assuredly be within his power and this verily would be easy and possible unto him he it is who created the paradise of the bayán for his own sake from him have all things proceeded and unto him will they all return did ye but know it yet swear by him in whose hand is the kingdom of creation ye deny him the right to designate himself by single one of the divine names even though he it is at whose mighty and exalted behest all names and their kingdom were created alas alas for your negligence people of the bayán alas alas for your blindness concourse of the faithless for prompted by self conceit and vainglory ye have ascribed the station of successor to one of his enemies and have contended thereby with god the author of all religions aforetime and hereafter thus have ye returned to the arguments of the people of the qur’án notwithstanding that we prohibited you from uttering single word in his presence save by his leave god knoweth and testifieth to the truth of my words contemplate therefore your condition and the measure of your understanding woe betide you and your thoughts and your judgement ye that are in grievous loss know ye not that we have rolled up that which the people possessed and have unfolded new order in its place blessed then be god the sovereign king the unfolder the almighty the most generous say people cease your slander of me no word have spoken except in praise of this revelation no breath have drawn but for the love of its author and nowhere have turned my face save towards his shining and luminous countenance have made the bayán and all that was revealed therein to be as leaf in the celestial garden that belongeth unto him the protector the gracious the almighty beware lest ye appropriate it and surrender it to him who in pursuit of self and desire seeketh to shed my blood anew and who contendeth with god we verily unfolded the bayán from single word and returned it again to that same word bidding it to appear before the throne of him who is the all knowing the all wise that he might behold his former creation and take delight therein be fair then in your judgement is it the prerogative of the author of that word to lay hand upon it or of any other soul what hath made you so blind concourse of veiled ones we verily enjoined the people of the bayán to wear silken garments and to be immaculate in their person and dress that his gaze might not fall upon aught that would displease him likewise every provision that hath been expounded in our perspicuous book is but for his sake were ye to judge fairly we created the heavens and the earth and all that lieth between them for his loved ones how much more for the sake of his most resplendent his most glorious and radiant beauty and yet ye have laid hold on that which we have destined for him and seized upon it to reject my beloved what hath made you so heedless people of malice and what will satisfy you in this day stirrers of sedition ye have opposed him and all that he hath manifested even though we admonished you in our tablets that whoso calleth to mind his most great and most wondrous name should arise from his place and repeat nineteen times “glorified be god the lord of the kingdoms of earth and heaven and then another nineteen times “glorified be god the lord of all glory and dominion and so forth as we have revealed in most mighty tablet ye however have disbelieved in him and in his verses nay not contenting yourselves with that ye have disregarded the rights of god which revert unto him and have given no heed to that commandment of god which pertaineth to his own self the most exalted the all knowing ye have rejected all of his actions one after another and taken pleasure in deriding him among you is he who saith “he drinketh tea while another complaineth “he partaketh of food yet another doth object to his apparel though every thread thereof testifieth that there is none other god but him and that he is the object of the adoration of all who are nigh unto god bear witness that at times the ancient beauty was in want of even change of garments thus testifieth the tongue of truth and knowledge many night was he unable to provide sustenance for his kindred yet he concealed his plight to safeguard the honour of god’s mighty and unassailable cause and this notwithstanding that all things were created for his sake and that the key to the treasure houses of earth and heaven is in his grasp woe betide you for your shamelessness people of the bayán god is my witness am abashed at your deeds and disavow you assemblage of evil ones alas for the sufferings he hath endured at your hands alas for what hath befallen him and doth continue to afflict him at every moment people judge with fairness and reflect for but moment if ye remain blinded by such veils then to what end did reveal myself and what fruit did my revelation bear concourse of hypocrites god hath called me forth to rend asunder the veils and to purify your hearts in anticipation of this revelation yet ye have committed that which caused my tears and the tears of the holy ones to flow the faces of the former generations blanch at your doings for ye are more veiled than they and more heedless than the followers of the torah the evangel or any other book would that had never been born and had never revealed myself to you treacherous ones swear by him who sent me forth with the power of truth have reckoned up the knowledge of all things and know all that is preserved in the inviolable treasuries of god and concealed from the eyes of men but never have encountered people more wayward and more wicked than you for with all that we have expounded in our tablets and all the admonitions we have addressed unto you in every page thereof we are unable to conceive that single soul on earth would dare protest against god in whose grasp are the kingdoms of earth and heaven we are perplexed at your creation and know not from what word ye were fashioned ye whose nature and actions astound the hearts of the concourse on high and them that are devoted to god and them that enjoy near access unto him servant thus do we relate unto thee in this tablet that which the dove of the bayán warbleth at this moment before the throne of thy lord the almighty the all praised peruse then that which is revealed therein but guard its pearls of inner meaning from the hands of the treacherous and thieving among the hosts of the evil one shouldst thou find discerning soul set this tablet before his eyes that he may in turn behold it and be of them that attain haply they that are endued with insight amongst our righteous servants will become apprised of what hath befallen the celestial beauty at the hands of these profligate souls who have chosen to worship the calf rather than the lord god have prostrated themselves before it every morn and eventide and have exulted therein grieve not on account of our adversity but be patient even as we have been patient he in truth is the best of helpers remember thy lord in the daytime and in the night season and extol his praise amidst his servants haply the fire of his love will thereby be kindled in the hearts of the righteous and all shall arise in turn to extol god their lord the lord of the seen and the unseen and the lord of your sires of old excerpt from the súriy aḥzán súrih of sorrows would that thou wert standing at this moment before the throne and couldst hear how the melodies of eternity issue from the temple of bahá by the one true god should his creatures but cleanse their ears and should they hear but single strain of these melodies they would one and all fall thunderstruck upon the dust in the presence of thy lord the all glorious the most bountiful since however they have contended with god he hath denied them the wonders of his grace and hath reckoned them in his sight as discarded lumps of clay by god wert thou to consider their words thou wouldst hear what was never heard from the jews when we sent the spirit unto them with perspicuous book nor from the concourse of the gospel when we caused the day star of eternity to dawn above the horizon of mecca with world illumining splendours nor yet from the people of the qur’án when the heavens of divine knowledge were cleft asunder and god manifested himself with the power of the truth and in the shadow of his all merciful name in the beauty of ‘alí at the mention of this blessed this hallowed this exalted and unapproachably wondrous name name in truth most wondrous there arise within me two conditions see my heart burning with the fire of grief over that which befell the beauty of the all merciful at the hands of the people of the qur’án it is as though every limb of my body were being devoured by consuming flame that if left unchecked would set ablaze the entire world to this god himself beareth me witness likewise behold tears flowing from mine eyes and my limbs and even the hairs of my head at the calamities that were visited upon him by the wicked who slew god and recognized him not and who boasting of allegiance to but one of his names suspended him in the air and riddled his breast with the bullets of hatred would that the universe had never been called into existence would that the world had never been brought into being would that no prophet had ever been raised up no messenger sent forth and no cause established amongst men would that the name of god had never been manifested betwixt earth and heaven and that no books tablets or scriptures had ever been revealed would that the ancient beauty had never been made to dwell among these workers of iniquity nor to suffer at the hands of those who openly disbelieved in god and who committed against him that which none on earth had ever dared commit by the one true god wert thou ‘alí to examine my limbs and members my heart and vitals thou wouldst discover the traces of those same bullets that struck that temple of god alas alas thus was the revealer of verses prevented from revealing them and this ocean from surging and this tree from bearing fruit and this cloud from pouring down its rain and this sun from giving its light and this heaven from ascending on high yet so hath it been irrevocably decreed in this day would that had never been and that my mother had never borne me would that had never heard of that which befell him at the hands of those who worshipped the names of god and yet slew him who is their author their creator their fashioner and their revealer woe betide them for following the promptings of self and passion and for committing that which caused the maids of heaven to faint away in their celestial chambers and the spirit to cover its face in the dust by reason of that which these wolves have inflicted upon the lord of lords all things weep at the tears shed for him all things lament at the sighs uttered over our separation such indeed is my sorrow that the melodies of eternity can no longer flow from my lips nor can the breezes of the spirit waft from my heart and had not sought to protect myself my body would have been cleft asunder and my life extinguished behold my former manifestation weepeth in turn and addresseth thee saying “o ‘alí by the righteousness of the one true god wert thou to examine my heart my limbs and my members and to observe mine inner and outer being thou wouldst find the traces of the darts of rancour that have struck my latter manifestation who appeareth in my name the all glorious thus do lament and the concourse on high lament my weeping thus do bewail and the dwellers of the tabernacle of names bewail my cries thus do sigh in anguish and the inhabitants of the cities of eternity shed tears at my sighing for this wronged one who findeth himself among the people of the bayán by god they have inflicted upon him that which the followers of the qur’án never inflicted upon me alas for what hath befallen him at their hands whereupon did the denizens of earth and heaven fall distraught upon the dust at that which had afflicted that beauty who was seated upon the throne of divine nearness woe to them and to what their hands have wrought every morn and eve behold the ancient beauty crieth out “o pen of the most high turn aside from this theme which hath saddened all that wear the garment of existence and make mention of another out of mercy for the concourse on high by the one true god his throne hath well nigh been overwhelmed notwithstanding its grandeur and loftiness when we heard this call we ceased

approaching the court of thy mercy and my monstrous deeds have caused me to stray far from the sanctuary of thy presence indeed am he that hath failed in duty towards thee and hath broken thy covenant and thy testament and committed that which hath made the dwellers of the cities of thy justice and the dawning places of thy grace in thy realms to lament testify my god that have put away thy commandments and clung to the dictates of my passions and have cast away the statutes of thy book and seized the book of mine own desire misery misery as mine iniquities waxed greater and greater thy forbearance towards me augmented and as the fire of my rebelliousness grew fiercer the more did thy forgiveness and thy grace seek to smother up its flame by the power of thy might thou who art the desire of the world and the best beloved of the nations thy long suffering hath puffed me up and thy patience hath emboldened me thou beholdest my god the tears that my shame hath caused to flow and the sighs which my heedlessness hath led me to utter swear by the greatness of thy majesty can find for myself no habitation save beneath the shadow of the court of thy bounty nor any refuge except under the canopy of thy mercy thou seest me in the midst of sea of despair and of hopelessness after thou didst cause me to hear thy words “despair not by thy power my sore injustice hath severed the cord of my hope and my rebellion hath darkened my face before the throne of thy justice thou beholdest my god him who is as one dead fallen at the door of thy favor ashamed to seek from the hand of thy loving kindness the living waters of thy pardon thou hast given me tongue wherewith to remember and praise thee and yet it uttereth that which hath caused the souls of such of thy chosen ones as are nigh unto thee to melt and the hearts of the sincere amongst the dwellers of the habitations of holiness to be consumed thou hast given me eyes to witness thy signs and to behold thy verses and to contemplate the revelations of thine handiwork but have rejected thy will and have committed what hath caused the faithful among thy creatures and the detached amidst thy servants to groan thou hast given me ears that may incline them unto thy praise and thy celebration and unto that which thou didst send down from the heaven of thy bounty and the firmament of thy will and yet alas alas have forsaken thy cause and have commanded thy servants to blaspheme against thy trusted ones and thy loved ones and have acted before the throne of thy justice in such wise that those that have recognized thy unity and are wholly devoted to thee among the dwellers of thy realm mourned with sore lamentation know not my god which among my evildoings to mention before the billowing ocean of thy favor nor which of my trespasses to declare when face to face with the splendors of the suns of thy goodly gifts and bounties “i beseech thee this very moment by the mysteries of thy book and by the things hid in thy knowledge and by the pearls that lie concealed within the shells of the ocean of thy mercy to reckon me among such as thou didst mention in thy book and describe in thy tablets hast thou decreed for me my god any joy after this tribulation or any relief to succeed this affliction or any ease to follow this trouble alas alas thou hast ordained that every pulpit be set apart for thy mention and for the glorification of thy word and the revelation of thy cause but have ascended it to proclaim the violation of thy covenant and have spoken unto thy servants such words as have caused the dwellers of the tabernacles of thy majesty and the denizens of the cities of thy wisdom to lament how often hast thou sent down the food of thine utterance out of the heaven of thy bounty and denied it and how numerous the occasions on which thou hast summoned me to the soft flowing waters of thy mercy and have chosen to turn away therefrom by reason of my having followed my own wish and desire by thy glory know not for which sin to beg thy forgiveness and implore thy pardon nor from which of mine iniquities to turn aside unto the court of thy bounteousness and the sanctuary of thy favor such are my sins and trespasses that no man can number them nor pen describe them implore thee thou that turnest darkness into light and revealest thy mysteries on the sinai of thy revelation to aid me at all times to put my trust in thee and to commit mine affairs unto thy care make me then my god content with that which the finger of thy decree hath traced and the pen of thy ordinance hath written potent art thou to do what pleaseth thee and in thy grasp are the reins of all that are in heaven and on earth no god is there but thee the all knowing the all wise oshaykh know thou that neither the calumnies which men may utter nor their denials nor any cavils they may raise can harm him that hath clung to the cord of the grace and seized the hem of the mercy of the lord of creation by god he the glory of god bahá hath spoken not from mere impulse he that hath given him voice is he that hath given voice unto all things that they may praise and glorify him there is none other god but him the one the incomparable the lord of strength the unconditioned they whose sight is keen whose ears are retentive whose hearts are enlightened and whose breasts are dilated recognize both truth and falsehood and distinguish the one from the other recite thou this prayer that hath flowed from the tongue of this wronged one and ponder thereon with heart rid of all attachment and with ears that are pure and sanctified be attentive to its meaning that haply thou mayest inhale the breath of detachment and have pity upon thyself and upon others “my god the object of my adoration the goal of my desire the all bountiful the most compassionate all life is of thee and all power lieth within the grasp of thine omnipotence whosoever thou exaltest is raised above the angels and attaineth the station ‘verily we uplifted him to place on high and whosoever thou dost abase is made lower than dust nay less than nothing divine providence though wicked sinful and intemperate we still seek from thee ‘seat of truth and long to behold the countenance of the omnipotent king it is thine to command and all sovereignty belongeth to thee and the realm of might boweth before thy behest everything thou doest is pure justice nay the very essence of grace one gleam from the splendors of thy name the all merciful sufficeth to banish and blot out every trace of sinfulness from the world and single breath from the breezes of the day of thy revelation is enough to adorn all mankind with fresh attire vouchsafe thy strength almighty one unto thy weak creatures and quicken them who are as dead that haply they may find thee and may be led unto the ocean of thy guidance and may remain steadfast in thy cause should the fragrance of thy praise be shed abroad by any of the divers tongues of the world out of the east or out of the west it would verily be prized and greatly cherished if such tongues however be deprived of that fragrance they assuredly would be unworthy of any mention in word or yet in thought we beg of thee providence to show thy way unto all men and to guide them aright thou art verily the almighty the most powerful the all knowing the all seeing we beseech god to aid thee to be just and fair minded and to acquaint thee with the things that were hidden from the eyes of men he in truth is the mighty the unconstrained we ask thee to reflect upon that which hath been revealed and to be fair and just in thy speech that perchance the splendors of the daystar of truthfulness and sincerity may shine forth and may deliver thee from the darkness of ignorance and illumine the world with the light of knowledge this wronged one hath frequented no school neither hath he attended the controversies of the learned by my life not of mine own volition have revealed myself but god of his own choosing hath manifested me in the tablet addressed to his majesty thesháh—may god blessed and glorified be he assist him—these words have streamed from the tongue of this wronged one “o king was but man like others asleep upon my couch when lo the breezes of the all glorious were wafted over me and taught me the knowledge of all that hath been this thing is not from me but from one who is almighty and all knowing and he bade me lift up my voice between earth and heaven and for this there befell me what hath caused the tears of every man of understanding to flow the learning current amongst men studied not their schools entered not ask of the city wherein dwelt that thou mayest be well assured that am not of them who speak falsely this is but leaf which the winds of the will of thy lord the almighty the all praised have stirred can it be still when the tempestuous winds are blowing nay by him who is the lord of all names and attributes they move it as they list the evanescent is as nothing before him who is the ever abiding his all compelling summons hath reached me and caused me to speak his praise amidst all people was indeed as one dead when his behest was uttered the hand of the will of thy lord the compassionate the merciful transformed me now is the moment in which to cleanse thyself with the waters of detachment that have flowed out from the supreme pen and to ponder wholly for the sake of god those things which time and again have been sent down or manifested and then to strive as much as lieth in thee to quench through the power of wisdom and the force of thy utterance the fire of enmity and hatred which smouldereth in the hearts of the peoples of the world the divine messengers have been sent down and their books were revealed for the purpose of promoting the knowledge of god and of furthering unity and fellowship amongst men but now behold how they have made the law of god cause and pretext for perversity and hatred how pitiful how regrettable that most men are cleaving fast to and have busied themselves with the things they possess and are unaware of and shut out as by veil from the things god possesseth say “o god my god attire mine head with the crown of justice and my temple with the ornament of equity thou verily art the possessor of all gifts and bounties justice and equity are twin guardians that watch over men from them are revealed such blessed and perspicuous words as are the cause of the well being of the world and the protection of the nations these words have streamed from the pen of this wronged one in one of his tablets “the purpose of the one true god exalted be his glory hath been to bring forth the mystic gems out of the mine of man—they who are the dawning places of his cause and the repositories of the pearls of his knowledge for god himself glorified be he is the unseen the one concealed and hidden from the eyes of men consider what the merciful hath revealed in the qur’án no vision taketh in him but he taketh in all vision and he is the subtile the all informed that the divers communions of the earth and the manifold systems of religious belief should never be allowed to foster the feelings of animosity among men is in this day of the essence of the faith of god and his religion these principles and laws these firmly established and mighty systems have proceeded from one source and are rays of one light that they differ one from another is to be attributed to the varying requirements of the ages in which they were promulgated gird up the loins of your endeavor people of bahá that haply the tumult of religious dissension and strife that agitateth the peoples of the earth may be stilled that every trace of it may be completely obliterated for the love of god and them that serve him arise to aid this sublime and momentous revelation religious fanaticism and hatred are world devouring fire whose violence none can quench the hand of divine power can alone deliver mankind from this desolating affliction consider the war that hath involved the two nations how both sides have renounced their possessions and their lives how many the villages that were completely wiped out the utterance of god is lamp whose light is these words ye are the fruits of one tree and the leaves of one branch deal ye one with another with the utmost love and harmony with friendliness and fellowship he who is the daystar of truth beareth me witness so powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth the one true god he who knoweth all things himself testifieth to the truth of these words exert yourselves that ye may attain this transcendent and most sublime station the station that can insure the protection and security of all mankind this goal excelleth every other goal and this aspiration is the monarch of all aspirations so long however as the thick clouds of oppression which obscure the daystar of justice remain undispelled it would be difficult for the glory of this station to be unveiled to men’s eyes these thick clouds are the exponents of idle fancies and vain imaginings who are none other but the divines of persia at one time we spoke in the language of the lawgiver at another in that of the truth seeker and the mystic and yet our supreme purpose and highest wish hath always been to disclose the glory and sublimity of this station god verily is sufficient witness consort with all men people of bahá in spirit of friendliness and fellowship if ye be aware of certain truth if ye possess jewel of which others are deprived share it with them in language of utmost kindliness and goodwill if it be accepted if it fulfill its purpose your object is attained if anyone should refuse it leave him unto himself and beseech god to guide him beware lest ye deal unkindly with him kindly tongue is the lodestone of the hearts of men it is the bread of the spirit it clotheth the words with meaning it is the fountain of the light of wisdom and understanding by “divines” in the passage cited above is meant those men who outwardly attire themselves with the raiment of knowledge but who inwardly are deprived therefrom in this connection we quote from the tablet addressed to his majesty thesháh certain passages from the “hidden words” which were revealed by the abhá pen under the name of the “book of fátimih the blessings of god be upon her “o ye that are foolish yet have name to be wise wherefore do ye wear the guise of the shepherd when inwardly ye have become wolves intent upon my flock ye are even as the star which riseth ere the dawn and which though it seem radiant and luminous leadeth the wayfarers of my city astray into the paths of perdition and likewise he saith “o ye seeming fair yet inwardly foul ye are like clear but bitter water which to outward seeming is crystal pure but of which when tested by the divine assayer not drop is accepted yea the sunbeam falls alike upon the dust and the mirror yet differ they in reflection even as doth the star from the earth nay immeasurable is the difference and also he saith “o essence of desire at many dawn have turned from the realms of the placeless unto thine abode and found thee on the bed of ease busied with others than myself thereupon even as the flash of the spirit returned to the realms of celestial glory and breathed it not in my retreats above unto the hosts of holiness and again he saith “o bond slave of the world many dawn hath the breeze of my loving kindness wafted over thee and found thee upon the bed of heedlessness fast asleep bewailing then thy plight it returned whence it came those divines however who are truly adorned with the ornament of knowledge and of goodly character are verily as head to the body of the world and as eyes to the nations the guidance of men hath at all times been and is dependent upon such blessed souls we beseech god to graciously aid them to do his will and pleasure he in truth is the lord of all men the lord of this world and of the next oshaykh we have learned that thou hast turned away from us and protested against us in such wise that thou hast bidden the people to curse me and decreed that the blood of the servants of god be shed god requite him who said “willingly will obey the judge who hath so strangely decreed that my blood be spilt at hill and at ḥaram verily say whatever befalleth in the path of god is the beloved of the soul and the desire of the heart deadly poison in his path is pure honey and every tribulation draught of crystal water in the tablet to his majesty thesháh it is written “by him who is the truth fear no tribulation in his path nor any affliction in my love for him verily god hath made adversity as morning dew upon his green pasture and wick for his lamp which lighteth earth and heaven set thine heart towards him who is the kaaba of god the help in peril the self subsisting and raise thou thine hands with such firm conviction as shall cause the hands of all created things to be lifted up towards the heaven of the grace of god the lord of all worlds turn then thy face towards him in such wise that the faces of all beings will turn in the direction of his shining and luminous horizon and say “thou seest me my lord with my face turned towards the heaven of thy bounty and the ocean of thy favor withdrawn from all else beside thee ask of thee by the splendors of the sun of thy revelation on sinai and the effulgences of the orb of thy grace which shineth from the horizon of thy name the ever forgiving to grant me thy pardon and to have mercy upon me write down then for me with thy pen of glory that which will exalt me through thy name in the world of creation aid me my lord to set myself towards thee and to hearken unto the voice of thy loved ones whom the powers of the earth have failed to weaken and the dominion of the nations has been powerless to withhold from thee and who advancing towards thee have said ‘god is our lord the lord of all who are in heaven and all who are on earth ’” oshaykh verily say the seal of the choice wine hath in the name of him who is the self subsisting been broken withhold not thyself therefrom this wronged one speaketh wholly for the sake of god thou too shouldst likewise for the sake of god meditate upon those things that have been sent down and manifested that haply thou mayest on this blessed day take thy portion of the liberal effusions of him who is truly the all bountiful and mayest not remain deprived thereof this indeed would not be hard for god dust made adam was raised up through the word of god to the heavenly throne and mere fisherman was made the repository of divine wisdom and abú dhar the shepherd became prince of the nations this day oshaykh hath never been nor is it now the day whereon man made arts and sciences can be regarded as true standard for men since it hath been recognized that he who was wholly unversed in any of them hath ascended the throne of purest gold and occupied the seat of honor in the council of knowledge whilst the acknowledged exponent and repository of these arts and sciences remained utterly deprived by “arts and sciences” is meant those which begin with words and end with words such arts and sciences however as are productive of good results and bring forth their fruit and are conducive to the well being and tranquility of men have been and will remain acceptable before god wert thou to give ear to my voice thou wouldst cast away all thy possessions and wouldst set thy face towards the spot wherein the ocean of wisdom and of utterance hath surged and the sweet savors of the loving kindness of thy lord the compassionate have wafted we deem it advisable in this connection to recount briefly some past events that perchance they may be the means of vindicating the cause of equity and justice at the time when his majesty thesháh may god his lord the most merciful aid him through his strengthening grace was planning journey to iṣfahán this wronged one having obtained his permission visited the holy and luminous resting places of the imáms may the blessings of god be upon them upon our return we proceeded to lavásán on account of the excessive heat prevailing in the capital following our departure there occurred the attempt upon the life of his majesty may god exalted and glorified be he assist him those days were troublous days and the fires of hatred burned high many were arrested among them this wronged one by the righteousness of god we were in no wise connected with that evil deed and our innocence was indisputably established by the tribunals nevertheless they apprehended us and from níyávarán which was then the residence of his majesty conducted us on foot and in chains with bared head and bare feet to the dungeon of ṭihrán brutal man accompanying us on horseback snatched off our hat whilst we were being hurried along by troop of executioners and officials we were consigned for four months to place foul beyond comparison as to the dungeon in which this wronged one and others similarly wronged were confined dark and narrow pit were preferable upon our arrival we were first conducted along pitch black corridor from whence we descended three steep flights of stairs to the place of confinement assigned to us the dungeon was wrapped in thick darkness and our fellow prisoners numbered nearly hundred and fifty souls thieves assassins and highwaymen though crowded it had no other outlet than the passage by which we entered no pen can depict that place nor any tongue describe its loathsome smell most of these men had neither clothes nor bedding to lie on god alone knoweth what befell us in that most foul smelling and gloomy place day and night while confined in that dungeon we meditated upon the deeds the condition and the conduct of the bábís wondering what could have led people so high minded so noble and of such intelligence to perpetrate such an audacious and outrageous act against the person of his majesty this wronged one thereupon decided to arise after his release from prison and undertake with the utmost vigor the task of regenerating this people one night in dream these exalted words were heard on every side “verily we shall render thee victorious by thyself and by thy pen grieve thou not for that which hath befallen thee neither be thou afraid for thou art in safety erelong will god raise up the treasures of the earth—men who will aid thee through thyself and through thy name wherewith god hath revived the hearts of such as have recognized him and when this wronged one went forth out of his prison we journeyed in pursuance of the order of his majesty thesháh—may god exalted be he protect him—to ‘iráq escorted by officers in the service of the esteemed and honored governments of persia and russia after our arrival we revealed as copious rain by the aid of god and his divine grace and mercy our verses and sent them to various parts of the world we exhorted all men and particularly this people through our wise counsels and loving admonitions and forbade them to engage in sedition quarrels disputes and conflict as result of this and by the grace of god waywardness and folly were changed into piety and understanding and weapons converted into instruments of peace during the days lay in the prison of ṭihrán though the galling weight of the chains and the stench filled air allowed me but little sleep still in those infrequent moments of slumber felt as if something flowed from the crown of my head over my breast even as mighty torrent that precipitateth itself upon the earth from the summit of lofty mountain every limb of my body would as result be set afire at such moments my tongue recited what no man could bear to hear we shall herewith cite few passages from tablets specifically revealed to this people so that every one may know of certainty that this wronged one hath acted in manner which hath been pleasing and acceptable unto men endued with insight and unto such as are the exponents of justice and equity “o ye friends of god in his cities and his loved ones in his lands this wronged one enjoineth on you honesty and piety blessed the city that shineth by their light through them man is exalted and the door of security is unlocked before the face of all creation happy the man that cleaveth fast unto them and recognizeth their virtue and woe betide him that denieth their station and in another connection these words were revealed “we enjoin the servants of god and his handmaidens to be pure and to fear god that they may shake off the slumber of their corrupt desires and turn toward god the maker of the heavens and of the earth thus have we commanded the faithful when the daystar of the world shone forth from the horizon of ‘iráq my imprisonment doeth me no harm neither the tribulations suffer nor the things that have befallen me at the hands of my oppressors that which harmeth me is the conduct of those who though they bear my name yet commit that which maketh my heart and my pen to lament they that spread disorder in the land and lay hands on the property of others and enter house without leave of its owner we verily are clear of them unless they repent and return unto god the ever forgiving the most merciful and in another connection “o peoples of the earth haste ye to do the pleasure of god and war ye valiantly as it behooveth you to war for the sake of proclaiming his resistless and immovable cause we have decreed that war shall be waged in the path of god with the armies of wisdom and utterance and of goodly character and praiseworthy deeds thus hath it been decided by him who is the all powerful the almighty there is no glory for him that committeth disorder on the earth after it hath been made so good fear god people and be not of them that act unjustly and again in another connection “revile ye not one another we verily have come to unite and weld together all that dwell on earth unto this beareth witness what the ocean of mine utterance hath revealed amongst men and yet most of the people have gone astray if anyone revile you or trouble touch you in the path of god be patient and put your trust in him who heareth who seeth he in truth witnesseth and perceiveth and doeth what he pleaseth through the power of his sovereignty he verily is the lord of strength and of might in the book of god the mighty the great ye have been forbidden to engage in contention and conflict lay fast hold on whatever will profit you and profit the peoples of the world thus commandeth you the king of eternity who is manifest in his most great name he verily is the ordainer the all wise and yet again in another connection “beware lest ye shed the blood of any one unsheathe the sword of your tongue from the scabbard of utterance for therewith ye can conquer the citadels of men’s hearts we have abolished the law to wage holy war against each other god’s mercy hath verily encompassed all created things if ye do but understand and yet again in another connection “o people spread not disorder in the land and shed not the blood of any one and consume not the substance of others wrongfully neither follow every accursed prattler and still again in another connection “the sun of divine utterance can never set neither can its radiance be extinguished these sublime words have in this day been heard from the lote tree beyond which there is no passing ‘i belong to him that loveth me that holdeth fast my commandments and casteth away the things forbidden him in my book ’” and still again in another connection “this is the day to make mention of god to celebrate his praise and to serve him deprive not yourselves thereof ye are the letters of the words and the words of the book ye are the saplings which the hand of loving kindness hath planted in the soil of mercy and which the showers of bounty have made to flourish he hath protected you from the mighty winds of misbelief and the tempestuous gales of impiety and nurtured you with the hands of his loving providence now is the time for you to put forth your leaves and yield your fruit the fruits of the tree of man have ever been and are goodly deeds and praiseworthy character withhold not these fruits from the heedless if they be accepted your end is attained and the purpose of life achieved if not leave them in their pastime of vain disputes strive people of god that haply the hearts of the divers kindreds of the earth may through the waters of your forbearance and loving kindness be cleansed and sanctified from animosity and hatred and be made worthy and befitting recipients of the splendors of the sun of truth in the fourth ishráq splendor of the ishráqát tablet of splendors we have mentioned “every cause needeth helper in this revelation the hosts which can render it victorious are the hosts of praiseworthy deeds and upright character the leader and commander of these hosts hath ever been the fear of god fear that encompasseth all things and reigneth over all things in the third tajallí effulgence of the book of tajallíyát book of effulgences we have mentioned “arts crafts and sciences uplift the world of being and are conducive to its exaltation knowledge is as wings to man’s life and ladder for his ascent its acquisition is incumbent upon everyone the knowledge of such sciences however should be acquired as can profit the peoples of the earth and not those which begin with words and end with words great indeed is the claim of scientists and craftsmen on the peoples of the world unto this beareth witness the mother book in this conspicuous station in truth knowledge is veritable treasure for man and source of glory of bounty of joy of exaltation of cheer and gladness unto him happy the man that cleaveth unto it and woe betide the heedless it is incumbent upon thee to summon the people under all conditions to whatever will cause them to show forth spiritual characteristics and goodly deeds so that all may become aware of that which is the cause of human upliftment and may with the utmost endeavor direct themselves towards the most sublime station and the pinnacle of glory the fear of god hath ever been the prime factor in the education of his creatures well is it with them that have attained thereunto the first word which the abhá pen hath revealed and inscribed on the first leaf of paradise is this “verily say the fear of god hath ever been sure defence and safe stronghold for all the peoples of the world it is the chief cause of the protection of mankind and the supreme instrument for its preservation indeed there existeth in man faculty which deterreth him from and guardeth him against whatever is unworthy and unseemly and which is known as his sense of shame this however is confined to but few all have not possessed and do not possess it it is incumbent upon the kings and the spiritual leaders of the world to lay fast hold on religion inasmuch as through it the fear of god is instilled in all else but him the second word we have recorded on the second leaf of paradise is the following “the pen of the divine expounder exhorteth at this moment the manifestations of authority and the sources of power namely the kings and rulers of the earth—may god assist them—and enjoineth them to uphold the cause of religion and to cleave unto it religion is verily the chief instrument for the establishment of order in the world and of tranquillity amongst its peoples the weakening of the pillars of religion hath strengthened the foolish and emboldened them and made them more arrogant verily say the greater the decline of religion the more grievous the waywardness of the ungodly this cannot but lead in the end to chaos and confusion hear me men of insight and be warned ye who are endued with discernment it is our hope that thou wilt hear with attentive ears the things we have mentioned unto thee that perchance thou mayest turn men away from the things they possess to the things that god possesseth we entreat god to deliver the light of equity and the sun of justice from the thick clouds of waywardness and cause them to shine forth upon men no light can compare with the light of justice the establishment of order in the world and the tranquillity of the nations depend upon it in the book of utterance these exalted words have been written down and recorded “say friends strive that haply the tribulations suffered by this wronged one and by you in the path of god may not prove to have been in vain cling ye to the hem of virtue and hold fast to the cord of trustworthiness and piety concern yourselves with the things that benefit mankind and not with your corrupt and selfish desires ye followers of this wronged one ye are the shepherds of mankind liberate ye your flocks from the wolves of evil passions and desires and adorn them with the ornament of the fear of god this is the firm commandment which hath at this moment flowed out from the pen of him who is the ancient of days by the righteousness of god the sword of virtuous character and upright conduct is sharper than blades of steel the voice of the true faith calleth aloud at this moment and saith people verily the day is come and my lord hath made me to shine forth with light whose splendor hath eclipsed the suns of utterance fear ye the merciful and be not of them that have gone astray the third word we have recorded on the third leaf of paradise is this “o son of man if thine eyes be turned towards mercy forsake the things that profit thee and cleave unto that which will profit mankind and if thine eyes be turned towards justice choose thou for thy neighbor that which thou choosest for thyself humility exalteth man to the heaven of glory and power whilst pride abaseth him to the depths of wretchedness and degradation great is the day and mighty the call in one of our tablets we have revealed these exalted words ‘were the world of the spirit to be wholly converted into the sense of hearing it could then claim to be worthy to hearken unto the voice that calleth from the supreme horizon for otherwise these ears that are defiled with lying tales have never been nor are they now fit to hear it well is it with them that hearken and woe betide the wayward we pray god—exalted be his glory—and cherish the hope that he may graciously assist the manifestations of affluence and power and the daysprings of sovereignty and glory the kings of the earth—may god aid them through his strengthening grace—to establish the lesser peace this indeed is the greatest means for insuring the tranquillity of the nations it is incumbent upon the sovereigns of the world—may god assist them—unitedly to hold fast unto this peace which is the chief instrument for the protection of all mankind it is our hope that they will arise to achieve what will be conducive to the well being of man it is their duty to convene an all inclusive assembly which either they themselves or their ministers will attend and to enforce whatever measures are required to establish unity and concord amongst men they must put away the weapons of war and turn to the instruments of universal reconstruction should one king rise up against another all the other kings must arise to deter him arms and armaments will then be no more needed beyond that which is necessary to insure the internal security of their respective countries if they attain unto this all surpassing blessing the people of each nation will pursue with tranquillity and contentment their own occupations and the groanings and lamentations of most men would be silenced we beseech god to aid them to do his will and pleasure he verily is the lord of the throne on high and of earth below and the lord of this world and of the world to come it would be preferable and more fitting that the highly honored kings themselves should attend such an assembly and proclaim their edicts any king who will arise and carry out this task he verily will in the sight of god become the cynosure of all kings happy is he and great is his blessedness in this land every time men are conscripted for the army great terror seizeth the people every nation augmenteth each year its forces for their ministers of war are insatiable in their desire to add fresh recruits to their battalions we have learned that the government of persia—may god assist them—have likewise decided to reinforce their army in the opinion of this wronged one force of one hundred thousand fully equipped and well disciplined men would suffice we hope that thou wilt cause the light of justice to shine more brightly by the righteousness of god justice is powerful force it is above all else the conqueror of the citadels of the hearts and souls of men and the revealer of the secrets of the world of being and the standard bearer of love and bounty in the treasuries of the knowledge of god there lieth concealed knowledge which when applied will largely though not wholly eliminate fear this knowledge however should be taught from childhood as it will greatly aid in its elimination whatever decreaseth fear increaseth courage should the will of god assist us there would flow out from the pen of the divine expounder lengthy exposition of that which hath been mentioned and there would be revealed in the field of arts and sciences what would renew the world and the nations word hath likewise been written down and recorded by the pen of the most high in the crimson book which is capable of fully disclosing that force which is hid in men nay of redoubling its potency we implore god—exalted and glorified be he—to graciously assist his servants to do that which is pleasing and acceptable unto him in these days enemies have compassed us about and the fire of hatred is kindled peoples of the earth by my life and by your own this wronged one hath never had nor hath he now any desire for leadership mine aim hath ever been and still is to suppress whatever is the cause of contention amidst the peoples of the earth and of separation amongst the nations so that all men may be sanctified from every earthly attachment and be set free to occupy themselves with their own interests we entreat our loved ones not to besmirch the hem of our raiment with the dust of falsehood neither to allow references to what they have regarded as miracles and prodigies to debase our rank and station or to mar the purity and sanctity of our name gracious god this is the day whereon the wise should seek the advice of this wronged one and ask him who is the truth what things are conducive to the glory and tranquillity of men and yet all are earnestly striving to put out this glorious and shining light and are diligently seeking either to establish our guilt or to voice their protest against us matters have come to such pass that the conduct of this wronged one hath in every way been grossly misrepresented and in manner which it would be unseemly to mention one of our friends hath reported that among the residents of the great city constantinople he had heard with the greatest regret someone state that each year sum of fifty thousand tumans was being despatched from his native land to ‘akká it hath not however been made clear who had disbursed the sum nor through whose hands it had passed briefly this wronged one hath in the face of all that hath befallen him at their hands and all that hath been said of him endured patiently and held his peace inasmuch as it is our purpose through the loving providence of god—exalted be his glory—and his surpassing mercy to abolish through the force of our utterance all disputes war and bloodshed from the face of the earth under all conditions we have in spite of what they have said endured with seemly patience and have left them to god in answer to this particular imputation however we have replied that if that which he affirmeth be true it behooveth him to be thankful to him who is the lord of all being and the king of the seen and unseen for having raised up in persia one who though prisoner and with none to help and assist him hath succeeded in establishing his ascendency over that land and in drawing from it yearly revenue such an achievement should be praised rather than censured if he be of them that judge equitably should anyone seek to be acquainted with the condition of this wronged one let him be told that these captives whom the world hath persecuted and the nations wronged have for days and nights been entirely denied the barest means of subsistence we are loth to mention such things neither have we had nor do we have now any desire to complain against our accuser within the walls of this prison highly esteemed man was for some time obliged to break stones that he might earn living whilst others had at times to nourish themselves with that divine sustenance which is hunger we entreat god—exalted and glorified be he—to aid all men to be just and fair minded and to graciously assist them to repent and return unto him he verily heareth and is ready to answer glorified art thou lord my god thou seest what hath befallen this wronged one at the hands of them that have not associated with me and who have arisen to harm and abase me in manner which no pen can describe nor tongue recount nor can any tablet sustain its weight thou hearest the cry of mine heart and the groaning of mine inmost being and the things that have befallen thy trusted ones in thy cities and thy chosen ones in thy land at the hands of such as have broken thy covenant and thy testament beseech thee my lord by the sighs of thy lovers throughout the world and by their lamentation in their remoteness from the court of thy presence and by the blood that hath been shed for love of thee and by the hearts that have melted in thy path to protect thy loved ones from the cruelty of such as have remained unaware of the mysteries of thy name the unconstrained assist them my lord by thy power that hath prevailed over all things and aid them to be patient and long suffering thou art the all powerful the almighty the all bountiful no god is there but thee the generous the lord of grace abounding in these days there are some who far from being just and fair minded have assaulted me with the sword of hatred and the spear of enmity forgetting that it behooveth every fair minded person to succor him whom the world hath cast away and the nations abandoned and to lay hold on piety and righteousness most men have until now failed to discover the purpose of this wronged one nor have they known the reason for which he hath been willing to endure countless afflictions meanwhile the voice of mine heart crieth out these words “o that my people knew this wronged one rid of attachment unto all things uttereth these exalted words “waves have encompassed the ark of god the help in peril the self subsisting fear not the tempestuous gales mariner he who causeth the dawn to appear is verily with thee in this darkness that hath struck terror into the hearts of all men except such as god the almighty the unconstrained hath been pleased to spare oshaykh swear by the sun of truth which hath risen and shineth above the horizon of this prison the betterment of the world hath been the sole aim of this wronged one unto this beareth witness every man of judgment of discernment of insight and understanding whilst afflicted with trials he held fast unto the cord of patience and fortitude and was satisfied with the things which have befallen him at the hands of his enemies and was crying out “i have renounced my desire for thy desire my god and my will for the revelation of thy will by thy glory desire neither myself nor my life except for the purpose of serving thy cause and love not my being save that may sacrifice it in thy path thou seest and knowest my lord that those whom we asked to be fair and just have unjustly and cruelly risen up against us openly they were with me yet secretly they assisted my foes who have arisen to dishonor me god my god testify that thou hast created thy servants to aid thy cause and exalt thy word and yet they have helped thine enemies beseech thee by thy cause that hath encompassed the world of being and by thy name wherewith thou hast subjected the seen and unseen to adorn the peoples of the earth with the light of thy justice and to illuminate their hearts with the brightness of thy knowledge am my lord thy servant and the son of thy servant bear witness unto thy unity and thy oneness and to the sanctity of thy self and the purity of thine essence thou beholdest my lord thy trusted ones at the mercy of the treacherous among thy creatures and the calumniators amidst thy people thou knowest what hath befallen us at the hands of them whom thou knowest better than we know them they have committed what hath torn the veil from such of thy creatures as are nigh unto thee beseech thee to assist them to obtain that which hath escaped them in the days of the dawning place of thy revelation and the dayspring of thine inspiration potent art thou to do what pleaseth thee and in thy grasp are the reins of all that is in heaven and all that is on earth the voice and the lamentation of the true faith have been raised it calleth aloud and saith “o people by the righteousness of god have attained unto him who hath manifested me and sent me down this is the day whereon sinai hath smiled at him who conversed upon it and carmel at its revealer and the sadrah at him who taught it fear ye god and be not of them that have denied him withhold not yourselves from that which hath been revealed through his grace seize ye the living waters of immortality in the name of your lord the lord of all names and drink ye in the remembrance of him who is the mighty the peerless we have under all circumstances enjoined on men what is right and forbidden what is wrong he who is the lord of being is witness that this wronged one hath besought from god for his creatures whatever is conducive to unity and harmony fellowship and concord by the righteousness of god this wronged one is not capable of dissimulation he verily hath revealed that which he desired he truly is the lord of strength the unrestrained we once again refer unto some of the sublime words revealed in the tablet to his majesty thesháh so that thou mayest know of certainty that whatever hath been mentioned hath come from god “o king was but man like others asleep upon my couch when lo the breezes of the all glorious were wafted over me and taught me the knowledge of all that hath been this thing is not from me but from one who is almighty and all knowing and he bade me lift up my voice between earth and heaven and for this there befell me what hath caused the tears of every man of understanding to flow the learning current amongst men studied not their schools entered not ask of the city wherein dwelt that thou mayest be well assured that am not of them who speak falsely this is but leaf which the winds of the will of thy lord the almighty the all praised have stirred can it be still when the tempestuous winds are blowing nay by him who is the lord of all names and attributes they move it as they list the evanescent is as nothing before him who is the ever abiding his all compelling summons hath reached me and caused me to speak his praise amidst all people was indeed as one dead when his behest was uttered the hand of the will of thy lord the compassionate the merciful transformed me can anyone speak forth of his own accord that for which all men both high and low will protest against him nay by him who taught the pen the eternal mysteries save him whom the grace of the almighty the all powerful hath strengthened “look upon this wronged one king with the eyes of justice judge thou then with truth concerning what hath befallen him of verity god hath made thee his shadow amongst men and the sign of his power unto all that dwell on earth judge thou between us and them that have wronged us without proof and without an enlightening book they that surround thee love thee for their own sakes whereas this youth loveth thee for thine own sake and hath had no desire except to draw thee nigh unto the seat of grace and to turn thee toward the right hand of justice thy lord beareth witness unto that which declare “o king wert thou to incline thine ears unto the shrill voice of the pen of glory and the cooing of the dove of eternity which on the branches of the lote tree beyond which there is no passing uttereth praises to god the maker of all names and the creator of earth and heaven thou wouldst attain unto station from which thou wouldst behold in the world of being naught save the effulgence of the adored one and wouldst regard thy sovereignty as the most contemptible of thy possessions abandoning it to whosoever might desire it and setting thy face toward the horizon aglow with the light of his countenance neither wouldst thou ever be willing to bear the burden of dominion save for the purpose of helping thy lord the exalted the most high then would the concourse on high bless thee how excellent is this most sublime station couldst thou ascend thereunto through the power of sovereignty recognized as derived from the name of god either thou or someone else hath said “let the súrih of tawhíd be translated so that all may know and be fully persuaded that the one true god begetteth not nor is he begotten moreover the bábís believe in his bahá’u’lláh’s divinity and godhood oshaykh this station is the station in which one dieth to himself and liveth in god divinity whenever mention it indicateth my complete and absolute self effacement this is the station in which have no control over mine own weal or woe nor over my life nor over my resurrection oshaykh how do the divines of this age account for the effulgent glory which the sadrah of utterance hath shed upon the son of ‘imrán moses on the sinai of divine knowledge he moses hearkened unto the word which the burning bush had uttered and accepted it and yet most men are bereft of the power of comprehending this inasmuch as they have busied themselves with their own concerns and are unaware of the things which belong unto god referring to this the siyyid of findirisk hath well said “this theme no mortal mind can fathom be it even that of abú nasr or abú ‘alí síná avicenna what explanation can they give concerning that which the seal of the prophets muḥammad —may the souls of all else but him be offered up for his sake—hath said “ye verily shall behold your lord as ye behold the full moon on its fourteenth night the commander of the faithful imám ‘alí —peace be upon him—moreover saith in thekhutbiy tutúnjíyyih “anticipate ye the revelation of him who conversed with moses from the burning bush on sinai ḥusayn the son of ‘alí—peace be upon him—likewise saith “will there be vouchsafed unto anyone besides thee revelation which hath not been vouchsafed unto thyself—a revelation whose revealer will be he who revealed thee blind be the eye that seeth thee not similar sayings from the imáms—the blessings of god be upon them—have been recorded and are widely known and are embodied in books worthy of credence blessed is he that perceiveth and speaketh the pure truth well is it with him who aided by the living waters of the utterance of him who is the desire of all men hath purified himself from idle fancies and vain imaginings and torn away in the name of the all possessing the most high the veils of doubt and renounced the world and all that is therein and directed himself towards the most great prison oshaykh no breeze can compare with the breezes of divine revelation whilst the word which is uttered by god shineth and flasheth as the sun amidst the books of men happy the man that hath discovered it and recognized it and said “praised be thou who art the desire of the world and thanks be to thee well beloved of the hearts of such as are devoted to thee men have failed to perceive our purpose in the references we have made to divinity and godhood were they to apprehend it they would arise from their places and cry out “we verily ask pardon of god the seal of the prophets—may the souls of all else but him be offered up for his sake—saith “manifold are our relationships with god at one time we are he himself and he is we ourself at another he is that he is and we are that we are aside from this why is it that thou didst not mention those other stations which the abhá pen hath disclosed the tongue of this wronged one hath many day and night given utterance to these sublime words “o god my god bear witness to thy unity and thy oneness and that thou art god and that there is none other god but thee thou hast everlastingly been sanctified above the mention of any one but thee and the praise of all else except thyself and thou wilt everlastingly continue to be the same as thou wast from the beginning and hast ever been beseech thee king of eternity by the most great name and by the effulgences of the daystar of thy revelation upon the sinai of utterance and by the billows of the ocean of thy knowledge among all created things to graciously assist me in that which will draw me nigh unto thee and will detach me from all except thee by thy glory lord of all being and the desire of all creation would love to lay my face upon every single spot of thine earth that perchance it might be honored by touching spot ennobled by the footsteps of thy loved ones by the righteousness of god idle fancies have debarred men from the horizon of certitude and vain imaginings withheld them from the choice sealed wine in truth say and for the sake of god declare this servant this wronged one is abashed to claim for himself any existence whatever how much more those exalted grades of being every man of discernment while walking upon the earth feeleth indeed abashed inasmuch as he is fully aware that the thing which is the source of his prosperity his wealth his might his exaltation his advancement and power is as ordained by god the very earth which is trodden beneath the feet of all men there can be no doubt that whoever is cognizant of this truth is cleansed and sanctified from all pride arrogance and vainglory whatever hath been said hath come from god unto this he verily hath borne and beareth now witness and he in truth is the all knowing the all informed beseech god to grant unto men hearing ears and sharp sight and dilated breasts and receptive hearts that haply his servants may attain unto their hearts’ desire and set their faces towards their beloved troubles such as no eye hath beheld have touched this wronged one in proclaiming his cause he in no wise hesitated addressing himself unto the kings and rulers of the earth—may god exalted be he assist them—he imparted unto them that which is the cause of the well being the unity the harmony and the reconstruction of the world and of the tranquillity of the nations among them was napoleon iii who is reported to have made certain statement as result of which we sent him our tablet while in adrianople to this however he did not reply after our arrival in the most great prison there reached us letter from his minister the first part of which was in persian and the latter in his own handwriting in it he was cordial and wrote the following “i have as requested by you delivered your letter and until now have received no answer we have however issued the necessary recommendations to our minister in constantinople and our consuls in those regions if there be anything you wish done inform us and we will carry it out from his words it became apparent that he understood the purpose of this servant to have been request for material assistance we therefore revealed in his napoleon iii’s name verses in the súratu’l haykal some of which we now quote that thou mayest know that the cause of this wronged one hath been revealed for the sake of god and hath come from him “o king of paris tell the priest to ring the bells no longer by god the true one the most mighty bell hath appeared in the form of him who is the most great name and the fingers of the will of thy lord the most exalted the most high toll it out in the heaven of immortality in his name the all glorious thus have the mighty verses of thy lord been again sent down unto thee that thou mayest arise to remember god the creator of earth and heaven in these days when all the tribes of the earth have mourned and the foundations of the cities have trembled and the dust of irreligion hath enwrapped all men except such as god the all knowing the all wise was pleased to spare say he who is the unconditioned is come in the clouds of light that he may quicken all created things with the breezes of his name the most merciful and unify the world and gather all men around this table which hath been sent down from heaven beware that ye deny not the favor of god after it hath been sent down unto you better is this for you than that which ye possess for that which is yours perisheth whilst that which is with god endureth he in truth ordaineth what he pleaseth verily the breezes of forgiveness have been wafted from the direction of your lord the god of mercy whoso turneth thereunto shall be cleansed of his sins and of all pain and sickness happy the man that hath turned towards them and woe betide him that hath turned aside “wert thou to incline thine inner ear unto all created things thou wouldst hear ‘the ancient of days is come in his great glory everything celebrateth the praise of its lord some have known god and remember him others remember him yet know him not thus have we set down our decree in perspicuous tablet “give ear king unto the voice that calleth from the fire which burneth in this verdant tree on this sinai which hath been raised above the hallowed and snow white spot beyond the everlasting city ‘verily there is none other god but me the ever forgiving the most merciful we in truth have sent him whom we aided with the holy spirit jesus christ that he may announce unto you this light that hath shone forth from the horizon of the will of your lord the most exalted the all glorious and whose signs have been revealed in the west set your faces towards him bahá’u’lláh on this day which god hath exalted above all other days and whereon the all merciful hath shed the splendor of his effulgent glory upon all who are in heaven and all who are on earth arise thou to serve god and help his cause he verily will assist thee with the hosts of the seen and unseen and will set thee king over all that whereon the sun riseth thy lord in truth is the all powerful the almighty “the breezes of the most merciful have passed over all created things happy the man that hath discovered their fragrance and set himself towards them with sound heart attire thy temple with the ornament of my name and thy tongue with remembrance of me and thine heart with love for me the almighty the most high we have desired for thee naught except that which is better for thee than what thou dost possess and all the treasures of the earth thy lord verily is knowing informed of all arise in my name amongst my servants and say ‘o ye peoples of the earth turn yourselves towards him who hath turned towards you he verily is the face of god amongst you and his testimony and his guide unto you he hath come to you with signs which none can produce the voice of the burning bush is raised in the midmost heart of the world and the holy spirit calleth aloud among the nations ‘lo the desired one is come with manifest dominion “o king the stars of the heaven of knowledge have fallen they who seek to establish the truth of my cause through the things they possess and who make mention of god in my name and yet when came unto them in my glory they turned aside they indeed are of the fallen this is truly that which the spirit of god jesus christ hath announced when he came with truth unto you he with whom the jewish doctors disputed till at last they perpetrated what hath made the holy spirit to lament and the tears of them that have near access to god to flow “say concourse of monks seclude not yourselves in your churches and cloisters come ye out of them by my leave and busy then yourselves with what will profit you and others thus commandeth you he who is the lord of the day of reckoning seclude yourselves in the stronghold of my love this truly is the seclusion that befitteth you could ye but know it he that secludeth himself in his house is indeed as one dead it behooveth man to show forth that which will benefit mankind he that bringeth forth no fruit is fit for the fire thus admonisheth you your lord he verily is the mighty the bountiful enter ye into wedlock that after you another may arise in your stead we verily have forbidden you lechery and not that which is conducive to fidelity have ye clung unto the promptings of your nature and cast behind your backs the statutes of god fear ye god and be not of the foolish but for man who on my earth would remember me and how could my attributes and my names be revealed reflect and be not of them that have shut themselves out as by veil from him and were of those that are fast asleep he that married not jesus christ could find no place wherein to abide nor where to lay his head by reason of what the hands of the treacherous had wrought his holiness consisted not in the things ye have believed and imagined but rather in the things which belong unto us ask that ye may be made aware of his station which hath been exalted above the vain imaginings of all the peoples of the earth blessed are they that understand “o king we heard the words thou didst utter in answer to the czar of russia concerning the decision made regarding the war crimean war thy lord verily knoweth is informed of all thou didst say ‘i lay asleep upon my couch when the cry of the oppressed who were drowned in the black sea wakened me this is what we heard thee say and verily thy lord is witness unto what say we testify that that which wakened thee was not their cry but the promptings of thine own passions for we tested thee and found thee wanting comprehend the meaning of my words and be thou of the discerning it is not our wish to address thee words of condemnation out of regard for the dignity we conferred upon thee in this mortal life we verily have chosen courtesy and made it the true mark of such as are nigh unto him courtesy is in truth raiment which fitteth all men whether young or old well is it with him that adorneth his temple therewith and woe unto him who is deprived of this great bounty hadst thou been sincere in thy words thou wouldst have not cast behind thy back the book of god when it was sent unto thee by him who is the almighty the all wise we have proved thee through it and found thee other than that which thou didst profess arise and make amends for that which escaped thee erelong the world and all that thou possessest will perish and the kingdom will remain unto god thy lord and the lord of thy fathers of old it behooveth thee not to conduct thine affairs according to the dictates of thy desires fear the sighs of this wronged one and shield him from the darts of such as act unjustly “for what thou hast done thy kingdom shall be thrown into confusion and thine empire shall pass from thine hands as punishment for that which thou hast wrought then wilt thou know how thou hast plainly erred commotions shall seize all the people in that land unless thou arisest to help this cause and followest him who is the spirit of god jesus christ in this the straight path hath thy pomp made thee proud by my life it shall not endure nay it shall soon pass away unless thou holdest fast by this firm cord we see abasement hastening after thee whilst thou art of the heedless it behooveth thee when thou hearest his voice calling from the seat of glory to cast away all that thou possessest and cry out ‘here am lord of all that is in heaven and all that is on earth “o king we were in ‘iráq when the hour of parting arrived at the bidding of the king of islám sulṭán of turkey we set our steps in his direction upon our arrival there befell us at the hands of the malicious that which the books of the world can never adequately recount thereupon the inmates of paradise and they that dwell within the retreats of holiness lamented and yet the people are wrapped in thick veil and further we have said “more grievous became our plight from day to day nay from hour to hour until they took us forth from our prison and made us with glaring injustice enter the most great prison and if anyone ask them ‘for what crime were they imprisoned they would answer and say ‘they verily sought to supplant the faith with new religion if that which is ancient be what ye prefer wherefore then have ye discarded that which hath been set down in the torah and the evangel clear it up men by my life there is no place for you to flee to in this day if this be my crime then muḥammad the apostle of god committed it before me and before him he who was the spirit of god jesus christ and yet earlier he who conversed with god moses and if my sin be this that have exalted the word of god and revealed his cause then indeed am the greatest of sinners such sin will not barter for the kingdoms of earth and heaven and further we have said “as my tribulations multiplied so did my love for god and for his cause increase in such wise that all that befell me from the hosts of the wayward was powerless to deter me from my purpose should they hide me away in the depths of the earth yet would they find me riding aloft on the clouds and calling out unto god the lord of strength and of might have offered myself up in the way of god and yearn after tribulations in my love for him and for the sake of his good pleasure unto this bear witness the woes which now afflict me the like of which no other man hath suffered every single hair of mine head calleth out that which the burning bush uttered on sinai and each vein of my body invoketh god and saith ‘o would had been severed in thy path so that the world might be quickened and all its peoples be united thus hath it been decreed by him who is the all knowing the all informed “know of truth that your subjects are god’s trust amongst you watch ye therefore over them as ye watch over your own selves beware that ye allow not wolves to become the shepherds of the fold or pride and conceit to deter you from turning unto the poor and the desolate arise thou in my name above the horizon of renunciation and set then thy face towards the kingdom at the bidding of thy lord the lord of strength and of might and further we have said “adorn the body of thy kingdom with the raiment of my name and arise then to teach my cause better is this for thee than that which thou possessest god will thereby exalt thy name among all the kings potent is he over all things walk thou amongst men in the name of god and by the power of his might that thou mayest show forth his signs amidst the peoples of the earth and further we have said “doth it behoove you to relate yourselves to him who is the god of mercy and yet commit the things which the evil one hath committed nay by the beauty of him who is the all glorified could ye but know it purge your hearts from love of the world and your tongues from calumny and your limbs from whatsoever may withhold you from drawing nigh unto god the mighty the all praised say by the world is meant that which turneth you aside from him who is the dawning place of revelation and inclineth you unto that which is unprofitable unto you verily the thing that deterreth you in this day from god is worldliness in its essence eschew it and approach the most sublime vision this shining and resplendent seat shed not the blood of anyone people neither judge ye anyone unjustly thus have ye been commanded by him who knoweth who is informed of all they that commit disorders in the land after it hath been well ordered these indeed have outstepped the bounds that have been set in the book wretched shall be the abode of the transgressors and further we have said “deal not treacherously with the substance of your neighbor be ye trustworthy on earth and withhold not from the poor the things given unto you by god through his grace he verily will bestow upon you the double of what ye possess he in truth is the all bounteous the most generous people of bahá subdue the citadels of men’s hearts with the swords of wisdom and of utterance they that dispute as prompted by their desires are indeed wrapped in palpable veil say the sword of wisdom is hotter than summer heat and sharper than blades of steel if ye do but understand draw it forth in my name and through the power of my might and conquer then with it the cities of the hearts of them that have secluded themselves in the stronghold of their corrupt desires thus biddeth you the pen of the all glorious whilst seated beneath the swords of the wayward if ye become aware of sin committed by another conceal it that god may conceal your own sin he verily is the concealer the lord of grace abounding ye rich ones on earth if ye encounter one who is poor treat him not disdainfully reflect upon that whereof ye were created every one of you was created of sorry germ and further we have said “regard ye the world as man’s body which is afflicted with divers ailments and the recovery of which dependeth upon the harmonizing of all of its component elements gather ye around that which we have prescribed unto you and walk not in the ways of such as create dissension meditate on the world and the state of its people he for whose sake the world was called into being hath been imprisoned in the most desolate of cities ‘akká by reason of that which the hands of the wayward have wrought from the horizon of his prison city he summoneth mankind unto the dayspring of god the exalted the great exultest thou over the treasures thou dost possess knowing they shall perish rejoicest thou in that thou rulest span of earth when the whole world in the estimation of the people of bahá is worth as much as the black in the eye of dead ant abandon it unto such as have set their affections upon it and turn thou unto him who is the desire of the world whither are gone the proud and their palaces gaze thou into their tombs that thou mayest profit by this example inasmuch as we made it lesson unto every beholder were the breezes of revelation to seize thee thou wouldst flee the world and turn unto the kingdom and wouldst expend all thou possessest that thou mayest draw nigh unto this sublime vision we bade christian dispatch this tablet and he informed us that he transmitted both the original and its translation god the almighty the all knowing hath knowledge of all things one of the sections of the súratu’l haykal is the tablet addressed to his majesty the czar of russia—may god exalted and glorified be he—assist him “o czar of russia incline thine ear unto the voice of god the king the holy and turn thou unto paradise the spot wherein abideth he who among the concourse on high beareth the most excellent titles and who in the kingdom of creation is called by the name of god the effulgent the all glorious beware that nothing deter thee from setting thy face towards thy lord the compassionate the most merciful we verily have heard the thing for which thou didst supplicate thy lord whilst secretly communing with him wherefore the breeze of my loving kindness wafted forth and the sea of my mercy surged and we answered thee in truth thy lord verily is the all knowing the all wise whilst lay chained and fettered in the prison of ṭihrán one of thy ministers extended me his aid wherefore hath god ordained for thee station which the knowledge of none can comprehend except his knowledge beware lest thou barter away this sublime station and further we have said “he who is the father is come and the son jesus christ in the holy vale crieth out ‘here am here am lord my god whilst sinai circleth round the house and the burning bush calleth aloud ‘the all bounteous is come mounted upon the clouds blessed is he that draweth nigh unto him and woe betide them that are far away “arise thou amongst men in the name of this all compelling cause and summon then the nations unto god the mighty the great be thou not of them who called upon god by one of his names but who when he who is the object of all names appeared denied him and turned aside from him and in the end pronounced sentence against him with manifest injustice consider and call thou to mind the days whereon the spirit of god jesus christ appeared and herod gave judgment against him god however aided him with the hosts of the unseen and protected him with truth and sent him down unto another land according to his promise he verily ordaineth what he pleaseth thy lord truly preserveth whom he willeth be he in the midst of the seas or in the maw of the serpent or beneath the sword of the oppressor and further we have said “again say hearken unto my voice that calleth from my prison that it may acquaint thee with the things that have befallen my beauty at the hands of them that are the manifestations of my glory and that thou mayest perceive how great hath been my patience notwithstanding my might and how immense my forbearance notwithstanding my power by my life couldst thou but know the things sent down by my pen and discover the treasures of my cause and the pearls of my mysteries which lie hid in the seas of my names and in the goblets of my words thou wouldst for longing after his glorious and sublime kingdom lay down thy life in the path of god know thou that though my body be beneath the swords of my foes and my limbs be beset with incalculable afflictions yet my spirit is filled with gladness with which all the joys of the earth can never compare likewise we mention some verses from the tablet of her majesty the queen queen victoria —may god exalted and glorified be he assist her our purpose is that haply the breezes of revelation may envelop thee and cause thee to arise wholly for the sake of god and serve his cause and that thou mayest transmit any of the tablets of the kings which might have remained undelivered this mission is great mission and this service great service in those regions distinguished divines are numerous among whom are those siyyids who are renowned for their eminence and distinction confer with them and show them what hath flowed out of the pen of glory that haply they may be graciously aided to better the condition of the world and improve the character of peoples of different nations and may through the living waters of god’s counsels quench the hatred and the animosity which lie hid and smolder in the hearts of men we pray god that thou mayest be assisted therein and this verily would not be hard for him “o queen in london incline thine ear unto the voice of thy lord the lord of all mankind calling from the divine lote tree verily no god is there but me the almighty the all wise cast away all that is on earth and attire the head of thy kingdom with the crown of the remembrance of thy lord the all glorious he in truth hath come unto the world in his most great glory and all that hath been mentioned in the gospel hath been fulfilled the land of syria hath been honored by the footsteps of its lord the lord of all men and north and south are both inebriated with the wine of his presence blessed is the man that hath inhaled the fragrance of the most merciful and turned unto the dawning place of his beauty in this resplendent dawn the mosque of aqsá vibrateth through the breezes of its lord the all glorious whilst bathá mecca trembleth at the voice of god the exalted the most high every single stone of them celebrateth the praise of the lord through this great name and further we said “we make mention of thee for the sake of god and desire that thy name may be exalted through thy remembrance of god the creator of earth and of heaven he verily is witness unto that which say we have been informed that thou hast forbidden the trading in slaves both men and women this verily is what god hath enjoined in this wondrous revelation god hath truly destined reward for thee because of this he verily will pay the doer of good whether man or woman his due recompense wert thou to follow what hath been sent unto thee by him who is the all knowing the all informed as to him who turneth aside and swelleth with pride after that the clear tokens have come unto him from the revealer of signs his work shall god bring to naught he in truth hath power over all things man’s actions are acceptable after his having recognized the manifestation he that turneth aside from the true one is indeed the most veiled amongst his creatures thus hath it been decreed by him who is the almighty the most powerful “we have also heard that thou hast entrusted the reins of counsel into the hands of the representatives of the people thou indeed hast done well for thereby the foundations of the edifice of thine affairs will be strengthened and the hearts of all that are beneath thy shadow whether high or low will be tranquillized it behooveth them however to be trustworthy among his servants and to regard themselves as the representatives of all that dwell on earth this is what counselleth them in this tablet he who is the ruler the all wise and if any one of them directeth himself towards the assembly let him turn his eyes unto the supreme horizon and say ‘o my god ask thee by thy most glorious name to aid me in that which will cause the affairs of thy servants to prosper and thy cities to flourish thou indeed hast power over all things blessed is he that entereth the assembly for the sake of god and judgeth between men with pure justice he indeed is of the blissful “o ye members of assemblies in that land and in other countries take ye counsel together and let your concern be only for that which profiteth mankind and bettereth the condition thereof if ye be of them that scan heedfully regard the world as the human body which though at its creation whole and perfect hath been afflicted through various causes with grave disorders and maladies not for one day did it gain ease nay its sickness waxed more severe as it fell under the treatment of ignorant physicians who gave full rein to their personal desires and have erred grievously and if at one time through the care of an able physician member of that body was healed the rest remained afflicted as before thus informeth you the all knowing the all wise we behold it in this day at the mercy of rulers so drunk with pride that they cannot discern clearly their own best advantage much less recognize revelation so bewildering and challenging as this and further we have said “that which god hath ordained as the sovereign remedy and mightiest instrument for the healing of the world is the union of all its peoples in one universal cause one common faith this can in no wise be achieved except through the power of skilled an all powerful and inspired physician by my life this is the truth and all else naught but error each time that most mighty instrument hath come and that light shone forth from the ancient dayspring he was withheld by ignorant physicians who even as clouds interposed themselves between him and the world it failed therefore to recover and its sickness hath persisted until this day they indeed were powerless to protect it or to effect cure whilst he who hath been the manifestation of power amongst men was withheld from achieving his purpose by reason of what the hands of the ignorant physicians have wrought “consider these days in which he who is the ancient beauty hath come in the most great name that he may quicken the world and unite its peoples they however rose up against him with sharpened swords and committed that which caused the faithful spirit to lament until in the end they imprisoned him in the most desolate of cities and broke the grasp of the faithful upon the hem of his robe were anyone to tell them ‘the world reformer is come they would answer and say ‘indeed it is proven that he is fomenter of discord and this notwithstanding that they have never associated with him and have perceived that he did not seek for one moment to protect himself at all times he was at the mercy of the wicked doers at one time they cast him into prison at another they banished him and at yet another hurried him from land to land thus have they pronounced judgment against us and god truly is aware of what say this charge of fomenting discord is the same as that imputed aforetime by the pharaohs of egypt to him who conversed with god moses read thou what the all merciful hath revealed in the qur’án he—may he be blessed and glorified—saith “moreover we had sent moses of old with our signs and with clear authority to pharaoh and hamán and qarún and they said ‘sorcerer impostor and when he came to them from our presence with the truth they said ‘slay the sons of those who believe as he doth and save their females alive but the stratagem of the unbelievers issued only in failure and pharaoh said ‘let me alone that may kill moses and let him call upon his lord fear lest he change your religion or cause disorder to show itself in the land and moses said ‘i take refuge with my lord and your lord from every proud one who believeth not in the day of reckoning ’” men have at all times considered every world reformer fomenter of discord and have referred unto him in terms with which all are familiar each time the daystar of divine revelation shed its radiance from the horizon of god’s will great number of men denied him others turned aside from him and still others calumniated him and thereby withheld the servants of god from the river of loving providence of him who is the king of creation in like manner they who in this day have neither met this wronged one nor associated with him have said and even now continue to say the things thou hast heard and hearest still say “o people the sun of utterance beameth forth in this day above the horizon of bounty and the radiance of the revelation of him who spoke on sinai flasheth and glisteneth before all religions purge and sanctify your breasts and your hearts and your ears and your eyes with the living waters of the utterance of the all merciful and set then your faces towards him by the righteousness of god ye shall hear all things proclaim ‘verily he the true one is come blessed are they that judge with fairness and blessed they that turn towards him ’” among the things they have imputed to the divine lote tree moses are charges to the falsity of which every discerning man of knowledge and every wise and understanding heart will witness thou must no doubt have read and considered the verses which have been sent down concerning him who conversed with god he—may he be blessed and glorified—saith “he said ‘did we not rear thee among us when child and hast thou not passed years of thy life among us and yet what deed is that which thou hast done thou art one of the ungrateful he said ‘i did it indeed and was one of those who erred and fled from you because feared you but my lord hath given me wisdom and hath made me one of his apostles ’” and elsewhere he—may he be blessed and exalted—saith “and he entered city at the time when its inhabitants would not observe him and found therein two men fighting the one of his own people the other of his enemies and he who was of his own people asked his help against him who was of his enemies and moses smote him with his fist and slew him said he ‘this is work of satan for he is an enemy manifest misleader he said ‘o my lord have sinned to mine own hurt forgive me so god forgave him for he is the forgiving the merciful he said ‘lord because thou hast showed me this grace will never again be the helper of the wicked and in the city at noon he was full of fear casting furtive glances round him and lo the man whom he had helped the day before cried out to him again for help said moses to him ‘thou art plainly most depraved person and when he would have laid violent hands on him who was their common foe he said to him ‘o moses dost thou desire to slay me as thou slewest man yesterday thou desirest only to become tyrant in this land and desirest not to become peacemaker ’” thine ears and thine eyes must needs now be cleansed and sanctified that thou mayest be able to judge with fairness and justice moses himself moreover acknowledged his injustice and waywardness and testified that fear had seized him and that he had transgressed and fled away he asked god—exalted be his glory—to forgive him and he was forgiven oshaykh every time god the true one—exalted be his glory—revealed himself in the person of his manifestation he came unto men with the standard of “he doeth what he willeth and ordaineth what he pleaseth none hath the right to ask why or wherefore and he that doth so hath indeed turned aside from god the lord of lords in the days of every manifestation these things appear and are evident likewise they have said that about this wronged one to the falsity of which they who are nigh unto god and are devoted to him have borne and still bear witness by the righteousness of god this hem of his robe hath ever been and remaineth unsullied though many have at the present time purposed to besmirch it with their lying and unseemly calumnies god however knoweth and they know not he who through the might and power of god hath arisen before the face of all the kindreds of the earth and summoned the multitudes to the supreme horizon hath been repudiated by them and they have clung instead unto such men as have invariably withdrawn themselves behind veils and curtains and busied themselves about their own protection moreover many are now engaged in spreading lies and calumnies and have no other intention than to instill distrust into the hearts and souls of men as soon as someone leaveth the great city constantinople to visit this land they at once telegraph and proclaim that he hath stolen money and fled to ‘akká highly accomplished learned and distinguished man visited in his declining years the holy land seeking peace and retirement and about him they have written such things as have caused them who are devoted to god and are nigh unto him to sigh his excellency the late mírzá ḥusaynkhán mushíru’d dawlih —may god forgive him—hath known this wronged one and he no doubt must have given to the authorities circumstantial account of the arrival of this wronged one at the sublime porte and of the things which he said and did on the day of our arrival the government official whose duty it was to receive and entertain official visitors met us and escorted us to the place he had been bidden to take us in truth the government showed these wronged ones the utmost kindness and consideration the following day princeshuja’u’d dawlih accompanied by mírzá safá acting as the representatives of the late mushíru’d dawlih the minister accredited to the imperial court came to visit us others among whom were several ministers of the imperial government and including the late kamál páshá likewise called on us wholly reliant on god and without any reference to any need he might have had or to any other matter this wronged one sojourned for period of four months in that city his actions were known and evident unto all and none can deny them except such as hate him and speak not the truth he that hath recognized god recognizeth none other but him we have never liked nor like we to make mention of such things whenever high dignitaries of persia came to that city constantinople they would exert themselves to the utmost soliciting at every door such allowances and gifts as they might obtain this wronged one however if he hath done nothing that would redound to the glory of persia hath at least acted in manner that could in no wise disgrace it that which was done by his late excellency mushíru’d dawlih —may god exalt his station—was not actuated by his friendship towards this wronged one but rather was prompted by his own sagacious judgment and by his desire to accomplish the service he secretly contemplated rendering his government testify that he was so faithful in his service to his government that dishonesty played no part and was held in contempt in the domain of his activities it was he who was responsible for the arrival of these wronged ones in the most great prison ‘akká as he was faithful however in the discharge of his duty he deserveth our commendation this wronged one hath at all times aimed and striven to exalt and advance the interests of both the government and the people not to elevate his own station number of men have now gathered others about them and have arisen to dishonor this wronged one he nevertheless beseecheth god—hallowed and glorified be he—to aid them to return unto him and assist them to compensate for that which escaped them and repent before the door of his bounty he verily is the forgiving the merciful oshaykh my pen verily lamenteth over mine own self and my tablet weepeth sore over what hath befallen me at the hands of one mírzá yaḥyá over whom we watched for successive years and who day and night served in my presence until he was made to err by one of my servants named siyyid muḥammad unto this bear witness my believing servants who accompanied me in my exile from baghdád to this the most great prison and there befell me at the hands of both of them that which made every man of understanding to cry out and he who is endued with insight to groan aloud and the tears of the fair minded to flow we pray to god to graciously assist them that have been led astray to be just and fair minded and to make them aware of that whereof they have been heedless he in truth is the all bounteous the most generous debar not thy servants my lord from the door of thy grace and drive them not away from the court of thy presence assist them to dispel the mists of idle fancy and to tear away the veils of vain imaginings and hopes thou art verily the all possessing the most high no god is there but thee the almighty the gracious swear by the daystar of god’s testimony that hath shone from the horizon of certitude this wronged one in the daytime and in the night season occupied himself with that which would edify the souls of men until the light of knowledge prevailed over the darkness of ignorance oshaykh time and again have declared and now yet again affirm that for two score years we have through the grace of god and by his irresistible and potent will extended such aid to his majesty thesháh—may god assist him—as the exponents of justice and of equity would regard as incontestable and absolute none can deny it unless he be transgressor and sinner or one who would hate us or doubt our truth how very strange that until now the ministers of state and the representatives of the people have alike remained unaware of such conspicuous and undeniable service and if apprized of it have for reasons of their own chosen to ignore it previous to these forty years controversies and conflicts continually prevailed and agitated the servants of god but since then aided by the hosts of wisdom of utterance of exhortations and understanding they have all seized and taken fast hold of the firm cord of patience and of the shining hem of fortitude in such wise that this wronged people endured steadfastly whatever befell them and committed everything unto god and this notwithstanding that in mázindarán and at rasht great many have been most hideously tormented among them was his honor ḥájí náṣir who unquestionably was brilliant light that shone forth above the horizon of resignation after he had suffered martyrdom they plucked out his eyes and cut off his nose and inflicted on him such indignities that strangers wept and lamented and secretly raised funds to support his wife and children oshaykh my pen is abashed to recount what actually took place in the land of sád iṣfahán the fire of tyranny burned with such hot flame that every fair minded person groaned aloud by thy life the cities of knowledge and of understanding wept with such weeping that the souls of the pious and of the god fearing were melted the twin shining lights ḥasan and ḥusayn the king of martyrs and the beloved of martyrs offered up spontaneously their lives in that city neither fortune nor wealth nor glory could deter them god knoweth the things which befell them and yet the people are for the most part unaware before them one named kázim and they who were with him and after them his honor ashraf all quaffed the draught of martyrdom with the utmost fervor and longing and hastened unto the supreme companion in like manner at the time of sardár azízkhán that godly man mírzá muṣṭafá and his fellow martyrs were arrested and despatched unto the supreme friend in the all glorious horizon briefly in every city the evidences of tyranny beyond like or equal were unmistakably clear and manifest and yet none arose in self defence call thou to mind his honor badí who was the bearer of the tablet to his majesty thesháh and reflect how he laid down his life that knight who spurred on his charger in the arena of renunciation threw down the precious crown of life for the sake of him who is the incomparable friend oshaykh if things such as these are to be denied what shall then be deemed worthy of credence set forth the truth for the sake of god and be not of them that hold their peace they arrested his honor najaf ‘alí who hastened with rapture and great longing unto the field of martyrdom uttering these words “we have kept both bahá and thekhún bahá bloodmoney with these words he yielded up his spirit meditate on the splendor and glory which the light of renunciation shining from the upper chamber of the heart of mullá ‘alí ján hath shed he was so carried away by the breezes of the most sublime word and by the power of the pen of glory that to him the field of martyrdom equalled nay outrivalled the haunts of earthly delights ponder upon the conduct of ‘abá básir and siyyid ashraf zanjání they sent for the mother of ashraf to dissuade her son from his purpose but she spurred him on until he suffered most glorious martyrdom oshaykh this people have passed beyond the narrow straits of names and pitched their tents upon the shores of the sea of renunciation they would willingly lay down myriad lives rather than breathe the word desired by their enemies they have clung to that which pleaseth god and are wholly detached and freed from the things which pertain unto men they have preferred to have their heads cut off rather than utter one unseemly word ponder this in thine heart methinks they have quaffed their fill of the ocean of renunciation the life of the present world hath failed to withhold them from suffering martyrdom in the path of god in mázindarán vast number of the servants of god were exterminated the governor under the influence of calumniators robbed great many of all that they possessed among the charges he laid against them was that they had been laying up arms whereas upon investigation it was found out that they had nothing but an unloaded rifle gracious god this people need no weapons of destruction inasmuch as they have girded themselves to reconstruct the world their hosts are the hosts of goodly deeds and their arms the arms of upright conduct and their commander the fear of god blessed that one that judgeth with fairness by the righteousness of god such hath been the patience the calm the resignation and contentment of this people that they have become the exponents of justice and so great hath been their forbearance that they have suffered themselves to be killed rather than kill and this notwithstanding that these whom the world hath wronged have endured tribulations the like of which the history of the world hath never recorded nor the eyes of any nation witnessed what is it that could have induced them to reconcile themselves to these grievous trials and to refuse to put forth hand to repel them what could have caused such resignation and serenity the true cause is to be found in the ban which the pen of glory hath day and night chosen to impose and in our assumption of the reins of authority through the power and might of him who is the lord of all mankind remember the father of badí they arrested that wronged one and ordered him to curse and revile his faith he however through the grace of god and the mercy of his lord chose martyrdom and attained thereunto if ye would reckon up the martyrs in the path of god ye could not count them consider his honor siyyid ismá’íl—upon him be the peace of god and his loving kindness—how before daybreak he was wont to dust with his own turban the doorstep of my house and in the end whilst standing on the banks of the river with his eyes fixed on that same house offered up by his own hand his life do thou ponder on the penetrative influence of the word of god every single one of these souls was first ordered to blaspheme and curse his faith yet none was found to prefer his own will to the will of god oshaykh in former times he that was chosen to be slain was but one person whereas now this wronged one hath produced for thee that which causeth every fair minded man to marvel judge fairly adjure thee and arise to serve thy lord he verily shall reward thee with reward which neither the treasures of the earth nor all the possessions of kings and rulers can equal in all thine affairs put thy reliance in god and commit them unto him he will render thee reward which the book hath ordained as great occupy thyself during these fleeting days of thy life with such deeds as will diffuse the fragrance of divine good pleasure and will be adorned with the ornament of his acceptance the acts of his honor balál the ethiopian were so acceptable in the sight of god that the “sín” of his stuttering tongue excelled the “shín” pronounced by all the world this is the day whereon all peoples should shed the light of unity and concord in brief the pride and vanity of certain of the peoples of the world have made havoc of true understanding and laid waste the home of justice and of equity oshaykh that which hath touched this wronged one is beyond compare or equal we have borne it all with the utmost willingness and resignation so that the souls of men may be edified and the word of god be exalted while confined in the prison of the land of mím mázindarán we were one day delivered into the hands of the divines thou canst well imagine what befell us shouldst thou at some time happen to visit the dungeon of his majesty thesháh ask the director and chief jailer to show thee those two chains one of which is known as qarih kahar and the other as salásil swear by the daystar of justice that for four months this wronged one was tormented and chained by one or the other of them “my grief exceedeth all the woes to which jacob gave vent and all the afflictions of job are but part of my sorrows likewise ponder thou upon the martyrdom of ḥájí muḥammad riḍá in the city of love ‘ishqábád the tyrants of the earth have subjected that wronged one to such trials as have caused many foreigners to weep and lament for as reported and ascertained no less than thirty two wounds were inflicted upon his blessed body yet none of the faithful transgressed my commandment nor raised his hand in resistance come what might they refused to allow their own inclinations to supersede that which the book hath decreed though considerable number of this people have resided and still reside in that city we entreat his majesty thesháh —may god hallowed and glorified be he assist him—himself to ponder upon these things and to judge with equity and justice although in recent years number of the faithful have in most of the cities of persia suffered themselves to be killed rather than kill yet the hatred smouldering in certain hearts hath blazed more fiercely than before for the victims of oppression to intercede in favor of their enemies is in the estimation of rulers princely deed some must have certainly heard that this oppressed people have in that city ‘ishqábád pleaded with the governor on behalf of their murderers and asked for the mitigation of their sentence take then good heed ye who are men of insight oshaykh these perspicuous verses have been sent down in one of the tablets by the abhá pen “hearken servant unto the voice of this wronged one who hath endured grievous vexations and trials in the path of god the lord of all names until such time as he was cast into prison in the land of tá ṭihrán he summoned men unto the most sublime paradise and yet they seized him and paraded him through cities and countries how many the nights during which slumber fled from the eyes of my loved ones because of their love for me and how numerous the days whereon had to face the assaults of the peoples against me at one time found myself on the heights of mountains at another in the depths of the prison of tá ṭihrán in chains and fetters by the righteousness of god was at all times thankful unto him uttering his praise engaged in remembering him directed towards him satisfied with his pleasure and lowly and submissive before him so passed my days until they ended in this prison ‘akká which hath made the earth to tremble and the heavens to sigh happy that one who hath cast away his vain imaginings when he who was hid came with the standards of his signs we verily have announced unto men this most great revelation and yet the people are in state of strange stupor thereupon voice was raised from the direction of ḥijáz calling aloud and saying “great is thy blessedness ‘akká in that god hath made thee the dayspring of his most sweet voice and the dawn of his most mighty signs happy art thou in that the throne of justice hath been established upon thee and the daystar of god’s loving kindness and bounty hath shone forth above thy horizon well is it with every fair minded person that hath judged fairly him who is the most great remembrance and woe betide him that hath erred and doubted following upon the death of some of the martyrs the lawḥ burhán tablet of the proof was sent down from the heaven of the revelation of him who is the lord of religions “he is the almighty the all knowing the all wise the winds of hatred have encompassed the ark of bathá mecca by reason of that which the hands of the oppressors have wrought thou who art reputed for thy learning thou hast pronounced sentence against them for whom the books of the world have wept and in whose favor the scriptures of all religions have testified thou who art gone far astray art indeed wrapt in thick veil by god himself thou hast pronounced judgment against them through whom the horizon of faith hath been illumined unto this bear witness they who are the dawning places of revelation and the manifestations of the cause of thy lord the most merciful who have sacrificed their souls and all that they possessed in his straight path the faith of god hath cried everywhere by reason of thy tyranny and yet thou disportest thyself and art of them that exult there is no hatred in mine heart for thee nor for anyone every man of discernment beholdeth thee and such as are like thee engulfed in evident folly hadst thou realized that which thou hast done thou wouldst have cast thyself into the fire or abandoned thine home and fled unto the mountains or wouldst have groaned until thou hadst returned unto the place destined for thee by him who is the lord of strength and of might thou who art even as nothing rend thou asunder the veils of idle fancies and vain imaginings that thou mayest behold the daystar of knowledge shining from this resplendent horizon thou hast torn in pieces remnant of the prophet himself and imagined that thou hadst helped the faith of god thus hath thy soul prompted thee and thou art truly one of the heedless thine act hath consumed the hearts of the concourse on high and those of such as have circled round the cause of god the lord of the worlds the soul of the chaste one fátimih melted by reason of thy cruelty and the inmates of paradise wept sore in that blessed spot “judge thou fairly adjure thee by god what proof did the jewish doctors adduce wherewith to condemn him who was the spirit of god jesus christ when he came unto them with truth what could have been the evidence produced by the pharisees and the idolatrous priests to justify their denial of muḥammad the apostle of god when he came unto them with book that judged between truth and falsehood with justice which turned into light the darkness of the earth and enraptured the hearts of such as had known him indeed thou hast produced in this day the same proofs which the foolish divines advanced in that age unto this testifieth he who is the king of the realm of grace in this great prison thou hast truly walked in their ways nay hast surpassed them in their cruelty and hast deemed thyself to be helping the faith and defending the law of god the all knowing the all wise by him who is the truth thine iniquity hath made gabriel to groan and hath drawn tears from the law of god through which the breezes of justice have been wafted over all who are in heaven and on earth hast thou fondly imagined that the judgment thou didst pronounce hath profited thee nay by him who is the king of all names unto thy loss testifieth he with whom is the knowledge of all things as recorded in the preserved tablet “o thou who hast gone astray thou hast neither seen me nor associated with me nor been my companion for the fraction of moment how is it then that thou hast bidden men to curse me didst thou in this follow the promptings of thine own desires or didst thou obey thy lord produce thou sign if thou art one of the truthful we testify that thou hast cast behind thy back the law of god and laid hold on the dictates of thy passions nothing in truth escapeth his knowledge he verily is the incomparable the all informed heedless one hearken unto that which the merciful hath revealed in the qur’án ‘say not to every one who meeteth you with greeting “thou art not believer ”’ thus hath he decreed in whose grasp are the kingdoms of revelation and of creation if thou be of them that hearken thou hast set aside the commandment of god and clung unto the promptings of thine own desire woe then unto thee careless one that doubtest if thou deniest me by what proof canst thou vindicate the truth of that which thou dost possess produce it then thou who hast joined partners with god and turned aside from his sovereignty that hath encompassed the worlds “know thou that he is truly learned who hath acknowledged my revelation and drunk from the ocean of my knowledge and soared in the atmosphere of my love and cast away all else besides me and taken firm hold on that which hath been sent down from the kingdom of my wondrous utterance he verily is even as an eye unto mankind and as the spirit of life unto the body of all creation glorified be the all merciful who hath enlightened him and caused him to arise and serve his great and mighty cause verily such man is blessed by the concourse on high and by them who dwell within the tabernacle of grandeur who have quaffed my sealed wine in my name the omnipotent the all powerful if thou be of them that occupy such sublime station produce then sign from god the creator of the heavens and shouldst thou recognize thy powerlessness do thou rein in thy passions and return unto thy lord that perchance he may forgive thee thy sins which have caused the leaves of the divine lote tree to be burnt up and the rock to cry out and the eyes of men of understanding to weep because of thee the veil of divinity was rent asunder and the ark has foundered and the she camel was hamstrung and the spirit jesus groaned in his sublime retreat disputest thou with him who hath come unto thee with the testimonies of god and his signs which thou possessest and which are in the possession of them that dwell on earth open thine eyes that thou mayest behold this wronged one shining forth above the horizon of the will of god the sovereign the truth the resplendent unstop then the ear of thine heart that thou mayest hearken unto the speech of the divine lote tree that hath been raised up in truth by god the almighty the beneficent verily this tree notwithstanding the things that befell it by reason of thy cruelty and of the transgressions of such as are like thee calleth aloud and summoneth all men unto the sadratu’l muntahá and the supreme horizon blessed is the soul that hath gazed on the most mighty sign and the ear that hath heard his most sweet voice and woe to whosoever hath turned aside and done wickedly “o thou who hast turned away from god wert thou to look with the eye of fairness upon the divine lote tree thou wouldst perceive the marks of thy sword on its boughs and its branches and its leaves notwithstanding that god created thee for the purpose of recognizing and of serving it reflect that haply thou mayest recognize thine iniquity and be numbered with such as have repented thinkest thou that we fear thy cruelty know thou and be well assured that from the first day whereon the voice of the most sublime pen was raised betwixt earth and heaven we offered up our souls and our bodies and our sons and our possessions in the path of god the exalted the great and we glory therein amongst all created things and the concourse on high unto this testify the things which have befallen us in this straight path by god our hearts were consumed and our bodies were crucified and our blood was spilt while our eyes were fixed on the horizon of the loving kindness of their lord the witness the all seeing the more grievous their woes the greater waxed the love of the people of bahá unto their sincerity hath borne witness what the all merciful hath sent down in the qur’án he saith ‘wish ye then for death if ye are sincere who is to be preferred he that hath sheltered himself behind curtains or he that hath offered himself in the path of god judge thou fairly and be not of them that rove distraught in the wilderness of falsehood so carried away have they been by the living waters of the love of the most merciful that neither the arms of the world nor the swords of the nations have deterred them from setting their faces towards the ocean of the bounty of their lord the giver the generous “by god troubles have failed to unnerve me and the repudiation of the divines hath been powerless to weaken me have spoken and still speak forth before the face of men ‘the door of grace hath been unlocked and he who is the dayspring of justice is come with perspicuous signs and evident testimonies from god the lord of strength and of might present thyself before me that thou mayest hear the mysteries which were heard by the son of ‘imrán moses upon the sinai of wisdom thus commandeth thee he who is the dawning place of the revelation of thy lord the god of mercy from his great prison thereupon hath the cry and the lamentation of the true faith been raised once again saying “verily sinai calleth aloud and saith ‘o people of the bayán fear ye the merciful indeed have attained unto him who conversed upon me and the ecstasies of my joy have seized the pebbles of the earth and the dust thereof and the bush exclaimeth ‘o people of the bayán judge ye fairly that which hath in truth been manifested verily the fire which god revealed unto the one who conversed with him is now manifested unto this beareth witness every man of insight and understanding ’” we have made mention of certain martyrs of this revelation and have likewise cited some of the verses which were sent down concerning them from the kingdom of our utterance we fain would hope that rid of all attachment to the world thou wilt ponder the things which we have mentioned it behooveth thee now to reflect upon the state of mírzá hádí dawlat ábádí and of sád iṣfahání sadru’l ‘ulamá who reside in the land of tá ṭihrán no sooner had the former heard that he had been called bábí than he became so perturbed that his poise and dignity forsook him he ascended the pulpits and spoke words which ill befitted him from time immemorial the clay clods of the world have wholly by reason of their love of leadership perpetrated such acts as have caused men to err thou must not however imagine that all the faithful are such as these two we have described unto thee the constancy the firmness the steadfastness the certitude the imperturbability and the dignity of the martyrs of this revelation that thou mayest be well informed my purpose in citing the passages from the tablets to the kings and others hath been that thou mayest know of certainty that this wronged one hath not concealed the cause of god but hath proclaimed and delivered in the most eloquent language before the face of the world the things he had been commissioned to set forth certain faint hearted ones however such as hádí and others have tampered with the cause of god and have in their concern for this fleeting life said and done that which caused the eye of justice to weep and the pen of glory to groan notwithstanding their ignorance of the essentials of this cause whereas this wronged one hath revealed it for the sake of god hádí thou hast gone unto my brother and hast seen him set now thy face towards the court of this wronged one that haply the breezes of revelation and the breaths of inspiration may assist thee and enable thee to attain thy goal whoever gazeth this day on my signs will distinguish truth from falsehood as the sun from shadow and will be made cognizant of the goal god is aware and beareth me witness that whatever hath been mentioned was for the sake of god that haply thou mayest be the cause of the guidance of men and mayest deliver the peoples of the world from idle fancies and vain imaginings gracious god until now they that have turned aside and denied me have failed to recognize who despatched that which was delivered unto the herald—the primal point the knowledge of it is with god the lord of the worlds exert thyself oshaykh and arise to serve this cause the sealed wine is disclosed in this day before the faces of men seize it in the name of thy lord and quaff thy fill in remembrance of him who is the mighty the incomparable night and day hath this wronged one been occupied in that which would unite the hearts and edify the souls of men the events that have happened in persia during the early years have truly saddened the well favored and sincere ones each year witnessed fresh massacre pillage plunder and shedding of blood at one time there appeared in zanján that which caused the greatest consternation at another in nayríz and at yet another in tabarsí and finally there occurred the episode of the land of tá ṭihrán from that time onwards this wronged one assisted by the one true god—exalted be his glory—acquainted this oppressed people with the things which beseemed them all have sanctified themselves from the things which they and others possess and have clung unto and fixed their eyes upon that which pertaineth unto god it is now incumbent upon his majesty thesháh—may god exalted be he protect him—to deal with this people with loving kindness and mercy this wronged one pledgeth himself before the divine kaaba that apart from truthfulness and trustworthiness this people will show forth nothing that can in any way conflict with the world adorning views of his majesty every nation must have high regard for the position of its sovereign must be submissive unto him must carry out his behests and hold fast his authority the sovereigns of the earth have been and are the manifestations of the power the grandeur and the majesty of god this wronged one hath at no time dealt deceitfully with anyone every one is well aware of this and beareth witness unto it regard for the rank of sovereigns is divinely ordained as is clearly attested by the words of the prophets of god and his chosen ones he who is the spirit jesus —may peace be upon him—was asked “o spirit of god is it lawful to give tribute to caesar or not and he made reply “yea render to caesar the things that are caesar’s and to god the things that are god’s he forbade it not these two sayings are in the estimation of men of insight one and the same for if that which belonged to caesar had not come from god he would have forbidden it and likewise in the sacred verse “obey god and obey the apostle and those among you invested with authority by “those invested with authority” is meant primarily and more especially the imáms—the blessings of god rest upon them they verily are the manifestations of the power of god and the sources of his authority and the repositories of his knowledge and the daysprings of his commandments secondarily these words refer unto the kings and rulers—those through the brightness of whose justice the horizons of the world are resplendent and luminous we fain would hope that his majesty thesháh will shine forth with light of justice whose radiance will envelop all the kindreds of the earth it is incumbent upon every one to beseech the one true god on his behalf for that which is meet and seemly in this day god my god and my master and my mainstay and my desire and my beloved ask thee by the mysteries which were hid in thy knowledge and by the signs which have diffused the fragrance of thy loving kindness and by the billows of the ocean of thy bounty and by the heaven of thy grace and generosity and by the blood spilt in thy path and by the hearts consumed in their love for thee to assist his majesty thesháh with thy power and thy sovereignty that from him may be manifested that which will everlastingly endure in thy books and thy scriptures and thy tablets hold thou his hand my lord with the hand of thine omnipotence and illuminate him with the light of thy knowledge and adorn him with the adornment of thy virtues potent art thou to do what pleaseth thee and in thy grasp are the reins of all created things no god is there but thee the ever forgiving the all bounteous in the epistle to the romans saint paul hath written “let every soul be subject unto the higher powers for there is no power but of god the powers that be are ordained of god whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of god and further “for he is the minister of god revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil he saith that the appearance of the kings and their majesty and power are of god moreover in the traditions of old references have been made which the divines have seen and heard we beseech god—blessed and glorified be he—to aid thee oshaykh to lay fast hold on that which hath been sent down from the heaven of the bounty of god the lord of the worlds the divines must needs unite with his majesty thesháh and cleave unto that which will insure the protection the security the welfare and prosperity of men just king enjoyeth nearer access unto god than anyone unto this testifieth he who speaketh in his most great prison god there is none other god but him the one the incomparable the almighty the all knowing the all wise wert thou for the sake of god to ponder though it be but for an hour upon the things which have occurred in former times and more recently thou wouldst turn away from the things thou dost possess unto the things which belong unto god and wouldst become means for the exaltation of his word hath from the foundation of the world until the present day any light or revelation shone forth from the dayspring of the will of god which the kindreds of the earth have accepted and whose cause they have acknowledged where is it to be found and what is its name since the seal of the prophets muḥammad —may all else but him be his sacrifice—and before him the spirit of god jesus as far back as the first manifestation all have at the time of their appearance suffered grievously some were held to be possessed others were called impostors and were treated in manner that the pen is ashamed to describe by god there befell them what hath made all created things to sigh and yet the people are for the most part sunk in manifest ignorance we pray god to assist them to return unto him and to repent before the door of his mercy potent is he over all things at this moment the shrill voice of the most sublime pen hath been raised and hath addressed me saying “admonish theshaykheven as thou hast admonished one of thy branches sons that haply the breezes of thine utterance may attract and draw him nigh unto god the lord of the worlds “be generous in prosperity and thankful in adversity be worthy of the trust of thy neighbor and look upon him with bright and friendly face be treasure to the poor an admonisher to the rich an answerer to the cry of the needy preserver of the sanctity of thy pledge be fair in thy judgment and guarded in thy speech be unjust to no man and show all meekness to all men be as lamp unto them that walk in darkness joy to the sorrowful sea for the thirsty haven for the distressed an upholder and defender of the victim of oppression let integrity and uprightness distinguish all thine acts be home for the stranger balm to the suffering tower of strength for the fugitive be eyes to the blind and guiding light unto the feet of the erring be an ornament to the countenance of truth crown to the brow of fidelity pillar of the temple of righteousness breath of life to the body of mankind an ensign of the hosts of justice luminary above the horizon of virtue dew to the soil of the human heart an ark on the ocean of knowledge sun in the heaven of bounty gem on the diadem of wisdom shining light in the firmament of thy generation fruit upon the tree of humility we pray god to protect thee from the heat of jealousy and the cold of hatred he verily is nigh ready to answer thus hath my tongue spoken unto one of my branches sons and we have mentioned it unto such of our loved ones as have cast away their idle fancies and clung unto that which hath been prescribed unto them in the day whereon the daystar of certitude hath shone forth above the horizon of the will of god the lord of the worlds this is the day on which the bird of utterance hath warbled its melody upon the branches in the name of its lord the god of mercy blessed is the man that hath on the wings of longing soared towards god the lord of the judgment day the one true god well knoweth and all the company of his trusted ones testify that this wronged one hath at all times been faced with dire peril but for the tribulations that have touched me in the path of god life would have held no sweetness for me and my existence would have profited me nothing for them who are endued with discernment and whose eyes are fixed upon the sublime vision it is no secret that have been most of the days of my life even as slave sitting under sword hanging on thread knowing not whether it would fall soon or late upon him and yet notwithstanding all this we render thanks unto god the lord of the worlds mine inner tongue reciteth in the daytime and in the night season this prayer “glory to thee my god but for the tribulations which are sustained in thy path how could thy true lovers be recognized and were it not for the trials which are borne for love of thee how could the station of such as yearn for thee be revealed thy might beareth me witness the companions of all who adore thee are the tears they shed and the comforters of such as seek thee are the groans they utter and the food of them who haste to meet thee is the fragments of their broken hearts how sweet to my taste is the bitterness of death suffered in thy path and how precious in my estimation are the shafts of thine enemies when encountered for the sake of the exaltation of thy word let me quaff in thy cause my god and my master whatsoever thou didst desire and send down upon me in thy love all thou didst ordain by thy glory wish only what thou wishest and cherish what thou cherishest in thee have at all times placed my whole trust and confidence thou art verily the all possessing the most high raise up implore thee my god as helpers to this revelation such as shall be counted worthy of thy name and of thy sovereignty that they may remember thee among thy creatures and hoist the ensigns of thy victory in thy land and adorn them with thy virtues and thy commandments no god is there but thee the help in peril the self subsisting thereupon the voice of the true faith was lifted up calling aloud again and again and saying “o concourse of the earth by god am the true faith of god amongst you beware that ye deny me not god hath manifested me with light that hath encompassed all that are in the heavens and all that are on earth judge ye equitably people my manifestation and the revelation of my glory and the radiance of my light and be not of them that act unjustly oshaykh this wronged one beseecheth god—blessed and glorified be he—to make thee the one who will open the door of justice and reveal through thee his cause among his servants he verily is the all powerful the almighty the all bounteous oshaykh entreat thou the one true god to sanctify the ears and the eyes and the hearts of mankind and to protect them from the desires of corrupt inclination for malice is grievous malady which depriveth man from recognizing the great being and debarreth him from the splendors of the sun of certitude we pray and hope that through the grace and mercy of god he may remove this mighty obstacle he verily is the potent the all subduing the almighty at this moment voice was raised from the right hand of the luminous spot “god there is none other god but him the ordainer the all wise recite thou unto theshaykhthe remaining passages of the lawḥ burhán tablet of the proof that they may draw him unto the horizon of the revelation of his lord the god of mercy that haply he may arise to aid my cause with perspicuous signs and exalted testimonies and may speak forth amongst men that which the tongue of testimony hath spoken ‘the kingdom is god’s the lord of the worlds ’” “peruse thou the kitáb íqán book of certitude and that which the all merciful hath sent down unto the king of paris napoleon iii and to such as are like him that thou mayest be made aware of the things that have transpired in the past and be persuaded that we have not sought to spread disorder in the land after it had been well ordered we exhort wholly for the sake of god his servants let him who wisheth turn unto him and him who wisheth turn aside our lord the merciful is verily the all sufficing the all praised concourse of the kindreds of the earth this is the day whereon nothing amongst all things nor any name amongst all names can profit you save through this name which god hath made the manifestation of his cause and the dayspring of his most excellent titles unto all who are in the kingdom of creation blessed is that man that hath recognized the fragrance of the all merciful and been numbered with the steadfast your sciences shall not profit you in this day nor your arts nor your treasures nor your glory cast them all behind your backs and set your faces towards the most sublime word through which the scriptures and the books and this lucid tablet have been distinctly set forth cast away people the things ye have composed with the pen of your idle fancies and vain imaginings by god the daystar of knowledge hath shone forth above the horizon of certitude “o thou who art gone astray if thou hast any doubt concerning our conduct know thou that we bear witness unto that whereunto god hath himself borne witness ere the creation of the heavens and of the earth that there is none other god but him the almighty the all bounteous we testify that he is one in his essence one in his attributes he hath none to equal him in the whole universe nor any partner in all creation he hath sent forth his messengers and sent down his books that they may announce unto his creatures the straight path “hath thesháh been informed and chosen to close his eyes to thine acts or hath he been seized with fear at the howling of pack of wolves who have cast the path of god behind their backs and followed in thy way without any clear proof or book we have heard that the provinces of persia have been adorned with the adornment of justice when we observed closely however we found them to be the dawning places of tyranny and the daysprings of injustice we behold justice in the clutches of tyranny we beseech god to set it free through the power of his might and his sovereignty he verily overshadoweth all that is in the heavens and on earth to none is given the right to protest against any one concerning that which hath befallen the cause of god it behooveth whosoever hath set his face towards the most sublime horizon to cleave tenaciously unto the cord of patience and to put his reliance in god the help in peril the unconstrained ye loved ones of god drink your fill from the wellspring of wisdom and soar ye in the atmosphere of wisdom and speak forth with wisdom and eloquence thus biddeth you your lord the almighty the all knowing “o heedless one rely not on thy glory and thy power thou art even as the last trace of sunlight upon the mountain top soon will it fade away as decreed by god the all possessing the most high thy glory and the glory of such as are like thee have been taken away and this verily is what hath been ordained by the one with whom is the mother tablet where is he to be found who contended with god and whither is gone he that gainsaid his signs and turned aside from his sovereignty where are they who have slain his chosen ones and spilt the blood of his holy ones reflect that haply thou mayest perceive the breaths of thine acts foolish doubter because of you the apostle muḥammad lamented and the chaste one fátimih cried out and the countries were laid waste and darkness fell upon all regions concourse of divines because of you the people were abased and the banner of islám was hauled down and its mighty throne subverted every time man of discernment hath sought to hold fast unto that which would exalt islám ye raised clamor and thereby was he deterred from achieving his purpose while the land remained fallen in clear ruin “o my supreme pen call thou to remembrance the she serpent imám jum’ih of iṣfahán whose cruelty hath caused all created things to groan and the limbs of the holy ones to quake thus biddeth thee the lord of all names in this glorious station the chaste one fátimih hath cried out by reason of thine iniquity and yet thou dost imagine thyself to be of the family of the apostle of god thus hath thy soul prompted thee thou who hast withdrawn thyself from god the lord of all that hath been and shall be judge thou equitably she serpent for what crime didst thou sting the children of the apostle of god king of martyrs and beloved of martyrs and pillage their possessions hast thou denied him who created thee by his command ‘be and it was’ thou hast dealt with the children of the apostle of god as neither ‘ád hath dealt with húd northámúd with ṣáliḥ nor the jews with the spirit of god jesus the lord of all being gainsayest thou the signs of thy lord which had no sooner been sent down from the heaven of his cause than all the books of the world bowed down before them meditate that thou mayest be made aware of thine act heedless outcast erelong will the breaths of chastisement seize thee as they seized others before thee wait thou who hast joined partners with god the lord of the visible and the invisible this is the day which god hath announced through the tongue of his apostle reflect that thou mayest apprehend what the all merciful hath sent down in the qur’án and in this inscribed tablet this is the day whereon he who is the dayspring of revelation hath come with clear tokens which none can number this is the day whereon every man endued with perception hath discovered the fragrance of the breeze of the all merciful in the world of creation and every man of insight hath hastened unto the living waters of the mercy of his lord the king of kings heedless one the tale of the sacrifice ishmael hath been retold and he who was to be offered up hath directed his steps towards the place of sacrifice and returned not by reason of that which thy hand hath wrought perverse hater didst thou imagine that martyrdom could abase this cause nay by him whom god hath made to be the repository of his revelation if thou be of them that comprehend woe betide thee thou who hast joined partners with god and woe betide them that have taken thee as their leader without clear token or perspicuous book how numerous the oppressors before thee who have arisen to quench the light of god and how many the impious who murdered and pillaged until the hearts and souls of men groaned by reason of their cruelty the sun of justice hath been obscured inasmuch as the embodiment of tyranny hath been stablished upon the throne of hatred and yet the people understand not foolish one thou hast slain the children of the apostle and pillaged their possessions say was it in thine estimation their possessions or themselves that denied god judge fairly ignorant one that hath been shut out as by veil from god thou hast clung to tyranny and cast away justice whereupon all created things have lamented and still thou art among the wayward thou hast put to death the aged and plundered the young thinkest thou that thou wilt consume that which thine iniquity hath amassed nay by myself thus informeth thee he who is cognizant of all by god the things thou possessest shall profit thee not nor what thou hast laid up through thy cruelty unto this beareth witness thy lord the all knowing thou hast arisen to put out the light of this cause erelong will thine own fire be quenched at his behest he verily is the lord of strength and of might the changes and chances of the world and the powers of the nations cannot frustrate him he doeth what he pleaseth and ordaineth what he willeth through the power of his sovereignty consider the she camel though but beast yet hath the all merciful exalted her to so high station that the tongues of the earth made mention of her and celebrated her praise he verily overshadoweth all that is in the heavens and on earth no god is there but him the almighty the great thus have we adorned the heaven of our tablet with the suns of our words blessed the man that hath attained thereunto and been illumined with their light and woe betide such as have turned aside and denied him and strayed far from him praised be god the lord of the worlds oshaykh we have enabled thee to hear the melodies of the nightingale of paradise and unveiled to thine eyes the signs which god by his all compelling behest hath sent down in the most great prison that thine eye might be cheered and thy soul be well assured he verily is the all bounteous the generous arise thou through the power of his testimony to serve the cause of god thy lord the god of mercy if thy faith be fearful seize thou my tablet and preserve it in the bosom of trust and when thou enterest into the place of resurrection and god asketh thee by what proof thou hast believed in this revelation draw forth the tablet and say “by this book the holy the mighty the incomparable thereupon all will lift up their hands towards thee and will seize the tablet and will press it to their eyes and will inhale therefrom the fragrance of the utterance of god the lord of the worlds were god to torment thee for having believed in his signs in this revelation for what reason could he then torment such as have disbelieved in muḥammad the apostle of god and before him in jesus the son of mary and before him in the one who conversed with god moses and before him in the one who is the friend of god abraham and as far back as the one who was the first manifestation who was created by the will of thy lord the potent the all encompassing thus have we sent down our verses unto one before thee and recalled them unto thee in this day that thou mayest understand and be of them who are well assured thou who assumest the voice of knowledge this cause is too evident to be obscured and too conspicuous to be concealed it shineth as the sun in its meridian glory none can deny it unless he be hater and doubter at this moment it behooveth us to turn unto the desired one and cleave unto these most sublime words “o god my god thou hast lighted the lamp of thy cause with the oil of wisdom protect it from contrary winds the lamp is thine and the glass is thine and all things in the heavens and on earth are in the grasp of thy power bestow justice upon the rulers and fairness upon the divines thou art the all powerful who through the motion of thy pen hast aided thine irresistible cause and guided aright thy loved ones thou art the possessor of power and the king of might no god is there but thee the strong the unconstrained say thou also “o god my god yield thee thanks inasmuch as thou hast made me to drink of thy sealed wine from the hand of the bounty of thy name the self subsisting entreat thee by the splendors of the dayspring of thy revelation and by the potency of thy most sublime word and by the might of thy most exalted pen through whose movement the realities of all created things have been enraptured to aid his majesty thesháh to render thy cause victorious and to turn towards the horizon of thy revelation and to set his face in the direction of the lights of thy countenance assist him my lord to draw nigh unto thee help him then with the hosts of the heavens and of earth implore thee thou who art the lord of all names and the maker of the heavens by the light of thy cause and by the fire of the lote tree of thy loving kindness to help his majesty to reveal thy cause amidst thy creatures open then before his face the doors of thy grace and thy mercy and thy bounty potent art thou to do what pleaseth thee by thy word ‘be and it is ’” oshaykh we had seized the reins of authority by the power of god and his divine might as he alone can seize who is the mighty the strong none had the power to stir up mischief or sedition now however as they have failed to appreciate this loving kindness and these bounties they have been and will be afflicted with the retribution which their acts must entail the state officials considering the secret progress of the extended cord have from every direction incited and aided mine adversaries in the great city constantinople they have roused considerable number of people to oppose this wronged one things have come to such pass that the officials in that city have acted in manner which hath brought shame to both the government and the people distinguished siyyid whose well known integrity acceptable conduct and commercial reputation were recognized by the majority of fair minded men and who was regarded by all as highly honored merchant once visited beirut in view of his friendship for this wronged one they telegraphed the persian dragoman informing him that this siyyid assisted by his servant had stolen sum of money and other things and gone to ‘akká their design in this matter was to dishonor this wronged one and yet far be it from the people of this country to allow themselves to be deflected by these unseemly tales from the straight path of uprightness and truth briefly they have assaulted me from every side and are reinforcing mine adversaries this wronged one however beseecheth the one true god to graciously assist every one in that which beseemeth these days day and night fix my gaze on these perspicuous words and recite “o god my god beseech thee by the sun of thy grace and the sea of thy knowledge and the heaven of thy justice to aid them that have denied thee to confess and such as have turned aside from thee to return and those who have calumniated thee to be just and fair minded assist them my lord to return unto thee and to repent before the door of thy grace powerful art thou to do what thou willest and in thy grasp are the reins of all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth praise be unto god the lord of the worlds the time is at hand when whatsoever lieth hid in the souls and hearts of men will be disclosed this day is the day whereof luqmán spoke unto his son the day which the lord of glory announced and with which he acquainted him who was his friend muḥammad through these his words—exalted be he —“o my son verily god will bring everything to light though it were but the weight of grain of mustard seed and hidden in rock or in the heavens or in the earth for god is subtile informed of all this day the deceitful of eye and all that men’s breasts conceal are made known and laid bare before the throne of his revelation nothing whatsoever can escape his knowledge he heareth and seeth and he in truth is the all hearing the all seeing how very strange that they discern not between the trustworthy and the treacherous would that his majesty thesháh of persia—may god perpetuate his sovereignty—would inquire from the consuls of the honored persian government who have been in this country that he might become acquainted with the activities and behavior of this wronged one briefly they have incited great many such as akhtar and others and are busying themselves in spreading calumnies it is clear and evident that they will surround with their swords of hatred and their shafts of enmity the one whom they know to be an outcast among men and to have been banished from one country to another this is not the first time that such iniquity hath been perpetrated nor the first goblet that hath been dashed to the ground nor the first veil that hath been rent in twain in the path of god the lord of the worlds this wronged one however remained calm and silent in the most great prison busying himself with his own affairs and completely detached from all else but god iniquity waxed so grievous that the pens of the world are powerless to record it in this connection it is necessary to mention the following occurrence that haply men may take fast hold of the cord of justice and truthfulness ḥájíshaykhmuḥammad ‘alí—upon him be the glory of god the ever abiding—was merchant of high repute well known unto most of the inhabitants of the great city constantinople not long ago when the persian embassy in constantinople was secretly engaged in stirring up mischief it was noticed that this believing and sincere soul was greatly distressed finally one night he threw himself into the sea but was rescued by some passers by who chanced to come upon him at that moment his act was widely commented upon and given varied interpretations by different people following this one night he repaired to mosque and as reported by the guardian of that place kept vigil the whole night and was occupied until the morning in offering ardently and with tearful eyes his prayers and supplications upon hearing him suddenly cease his devotions the guardian went to him and found that he had already surrendered his soul an empty bottle was found by his side indicating that he had poisoned himself briefly the guardian while greatly astonished broke the news to the people it was found out that he had left two testaments in the first he recognized and confessed the unity of god that his exalted being had neither peer nor equal and that his essence was exalted above all praise all glorification and description he also testified to the revelation of the prophets and the holy ones and recognized what had been written down in the books of god the lord of all men on another page in which he had set down prayer he wrote these words in conclusion “this servant and the loved ones of god are perplexed on the one hand the pen of the most high hath forbidden all men to engage in sedition contention or conflict and on the other that same pen hath sent down these most sublime words ‘should anyone in the presence of the manifestation discover an evil intention on the part of any soul he must not oppose him but must leave him to god considering that on the one hand this binding command is clear and firmly established and that on the other calumnies beyond human strength to bear or endure have been uttered this servant hath chosen to commit this most grievous sin turn suppliantly unto the ocean of god’s bounty and the heaven of divine mercy and hope that he will blot out with the pen of his grace and bounteousness the misdeeds of this servant though my transgressions be manifold and unnumbered my evildoings yet do cleave tenaciously to the cord of his bounty and cling unto the hem of his generosity god is witness and they that are nigh unto his threshold know full well that this servant could not bear to hear the tales related by the perfidious therefore have committed this act if he chastise me he verily is to be praised for what he doeth and if he forgive me his behest shall be obeyed ponder now oshaykh the influence of the word of god that haply thou mayest turn from the left hand of idle fancy unto the right hand of certitude this wronged one hath never acted hypocritically towards any one in the cause of god and hath loudly proclaimed the word of god before the face of his creatures let him who wisheth turn thereunto and let him who wisheth turn aside if these things however that are so clear so manifest and indubitable be denied what else can be deemed acceptable and worthy of credence in the estimation of men of insight we beseech god—blessed and glorified be he—to forgive the aforementioned person ḥájíshaykhmuḥammad ‘alí and change his evil deeds into good ones he verily is the all powerful the almighty the all bounteous such things have appeared in this revelation that there is no recourse for either the exponents of science and knowledge or the manifestations of justice and equity other than to recognize them it is incumbent upon thee in this day to arise with celestial power and dissipate with the aid of knowledge the doubts of the peoples of the world so that all men may be sanctified and direct their steps towards the most great ocean and cleave fast unto that which god hath purposed every one who hath turned aside from me hath clung to his own idle words and therewith voiced his objections to him who is the truth gracious god such references as have been made to divinity and godhead by the holy ones and chosen ones of god have been made cause for denial and repudiation the imám ṣádiq hath said “servitude is substance the essence of which is divinity the commander of the faithful imám ‘alí answered an arab who had questioned him concerning the soul as follows “the third is the soul which is divine and celestial it is divine energy substance simple and self subsistent and further he—peace be upon him—said “therefore it is the most sublime essence of god the tree of blessedness the lote tree beyond which there is no passing the garden of repose the imám ṣádiq hath said “when our qá’im will arise the earth will shine with the light of her lord likewise lengthy tradition is attributed to ábí ‘abdi’lláh—peace be upon him—in which these sublime words are found “thereupon will he who is the all compelling—exalted and glorified be he—descend from the clouds with the angels and in the mighty qur’án “what can such expect but that god should come down to them overshadowed with clouds and in the tradition of mufaddál it is said “the qá’im will lean his back against the sanctuary and will stretch forth his hand and lo it shall be snow white but unhurt and he shall say ‘this is the hand of god the right hand of god that cometh from god at the command of god ’” in whichever manner these traditions are interpreted in that same manner let them also interpret that which the most sublime pen hath set down the commander of the faithful imám ‘alí hath said “i am he who can neither be named nor described and likewise he hath said “outwardly am an imám inwardly am the unseen the unknowable abú ja’far túsí hath said “i said to ábí ‘abdi’lláh ‘you are the way mentioned in the book of god and you are the impost and you are the pilgrimage he replied ‘o man we are the way mentioned in the book of god —exalted and glorified be he—and we are the impost and we are the fast and we are the pilgrimage and we are the sacred month and we are the sacred city and we are the kaaba of god and we are the qiblih of god and we are the face of god ’” jabír hath said that abú ja’far—peace be upon him—spoke to him as follows “o jabír give heed unto the bayán exposition and the má’ání significances he—peace be upon him—added “as to the bayán it consisteth in thy recognition of god—glorified be he—as the one who hath no equal and in thy adoration of him and in thy refusal to join partners with him as to the má’ání we are its meaning and its side and its hand and its tongue and its cause and its command and its knowledge and its right if we wish for something it is god who wisheth it and he desireth that which we desire moreover the commander of the faithful imám ‘alí —peace be upon him—hath said “how can worship lord whom have not seen and in another connection he saith “nothing have perceived except that perceived god before it god after it or god with it oshaykh ponder upon the things which have been mentioned perchance thou mayest quaff the sealed wine through the power of the name of him who is the self subsisting and obtain that which no one is capable of comprehending gird up the loins of endeavor and direct thyself towards the most sublime kingdom that haply thou mayest perceive as they descend upon me the breaths of revelation and inspiration and attain thereunto verily say the cause of god hath never had nor hath it now any peer or equal rend asunder the veils of idle fancies he in truth will reinforce thee and assist thee as token of his grace he verily is the strong the all subduing the almighty while there is yet time and the blessed lote tree is still calling aloud amongst men suffer not thyself to be deprived place thy trust in god and commit thine affairs unto him and enter then the most great prison that thou mayest hear what no ear hath ever heard and gaze on that which no eye hath ever seen after such an exposition can there remain any room for doubt nay by god who standeth over his cause in truth say on this day the blessed words “but he is the apostle of god and the seal of the prophets” have found their consummation in the verse “the day when mankind shall stand before the lord of the worlds render thou thanksgiving unto god for so great bounty oshaykh the breezes of revelation can never be confounded with other breezes now the lote tree beyond which there is no passing standeth laden with countless fruits before thy face besmirch not thyself with idle fancies as have done the people aforetime these utterances themselves proclaim the true nature of the faith of god he it is who witnesseth unto all things to demonstrate the truth of his revelation he hath not been nor is he dependent upon any one well nigh hundred volumes of luminous verses and perspicuous words have already been sent down from the heaven of the will of him who is the revealer of signs and are available unto all it is for thee to direct thyself towards the ultimate goal and the supreme end and the most sublime pinnacle that thou mayest hear and behold what hath been revealed by god the lord of the worlds ponder while upon the verses concerning the divine presence which have been sent down in the qur’án by him who is the lord of the kingdom of names perchance thou mayest discover the straight path and be made an instrument for the guidance of his creatures such one as thou must needs in this day arise to serve this cause the abasement of this wronged one as well as thy glory shall both pass away strive thou that haply thou mayest achieve deed the fragrance of which shall never fade from the earth concerning the divine presence there hath been sent down what no denier hath been or is now able to refute or repudiate he—blessed and exalted be he—saith “it is god who hath reared the heavens without pillars thou canst behold then mounted his throne and imposed laws on the sun and moon each traveleth to its appointed goal he ordereth all things he maketh his signs clear that ye may have firm faith in the presence of your lord he also saith “to him who hopeth to attain the presence of god the set time of god will surely come and he is the hearer the knower and further he—exalted be he—saith “as for those who believe not in the signs of god or that they shall ever attain his presence these of my mercy shall despair and these doth grievous chastisement await and likewise he saith “and they say ‘what when we shall have lain hidden in the earth shall we become new creation yea they deny that they shall attain the presence of their lord and likewise he saith “they truly doubt the presence of their lord he verily overshadoweth all things and likewise he saith “verily they who hope not to attain our presence and find their satisfaction in this world’s life and rest on it and who of our signs are heedless—these their abode the fire in recompense of their deeds and likewise he saith “but when our clear signs are recited to them they who look not forward to attain our presence say ‘bring different qur’án from this or make some change in it say it is not for me to change it as mine own soul prompteth follow only what is revealed to me verily fear if rebel against my lord the punishment of great day and likewise he saith “then gave we the book to moses—complete for him who should do right and decision for all matters and guidance and mercy that they might believe in the presence of their lord and likewise he saith “they are those who believe not in the signs of the lord or that they shall ever attain his presence vain therefore are their works and no weight will we allow them on the day of resurrection this shall be their reward—hell because they were unbelievers and treated my signs and my apostles with scorn and likewise he saith “hath the history of moses reached thee when he saw fire and said to his family ‘tarry ye here for perceive fire haply may bring you brand from it or find at the fire guide and when he came to it he was called to ‘o moses verily am thy lord therefore pull off thy shoes for thou art in the holy vale of towa and have chosen thee hearken then to what shall be revealed verily am god there is no god but me therefore worship me ’” and likewise he saith “have they not considered within themselves that god hath not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them but for serious end and for fixed term but truly most men believe not that they shall attain the presence of their lord and likewise he saith “what have they no thought that they shall be raised again for the great day the day when mankind shall stand before the lord of the worlds and likewise he saith “we heretofore gave the book to moses have thou no doubt as to his attaining our presence and he saith “aye but when the earth shall be crushed with crushing crushing and thy lord shall come and the angels rank on rank and likewise he saith “fain would they put out the light of god with their mouths but though the infidels hate it god will perfect his light and likewise he saith “and when moses had fulfilled the term and was journeying with his family he perceived fire on the mountain side he said to his family ‘wait ye for perceive fire haply may bring you tidings from it or brand from the fire to warm you and when he came up to it voice cried to him out of the bush from the right side of the vale in the sacred spot ‘o moses truly am god the lord of the worlds ’” in all the divine books the promise of the divine presence hath been explicitly recorded by this presence is meant the presence of him who is the dayspring of the signs and the dawning place of the clear tokens and the manifestation of the excellent names and the source of the attributes of the true god exalted be his glory god in his essence and in his own self hath ever been unseen inaccessible and unknowable by presence therefore is meant the presence of the one who is his vicegerent amongst men he moreover hath never had nor hath he any peer or likeness for were he to have any peer or likeness how could it then be demonstrated that his being is exalted above and his essence sanctified from all comparison and likeness briefly there hath been revealed in the kitáb íqán book of certitude concerning the presence and revelation of god that which will suffice the fair minded we beseech him—exalted be he—to aid every one to become the essence of truthfulness and to draw nigh unto him he verily is the lord of strength and power no god is there but him the all hearing the lord of utterance the almighty the all praised thou who art reputed for thy learning bid men to do that which is praiseworthy and be not of such as tarry observe thou with keen eye the sun of truth shineth resplendently at the bidding of the lord of the kingdom of utterance and the king of the heaven of knowledge above the horizon of the prison city of ‘akká repudiation hath not veiled it and ten thousand hosts arrayed against it were powerless to withhold it from shining thou canst excuse thyself no longer either thou must recognize it or—god forbid—arise and deny all the prophets reflect oshaykh upon theshí‘ih sect how many the edifices which they reared with the hands of idle fancies and vain imaginings and how numerous the cities which they built at length those vain imaginings were converted into bullets and aimed at him who is the prince of the world not one single soul among the leaders of that sect acknowledged him in the day of his revelation whenever his blessed name was mentioned all would say “may god hasten the joy his coming will bring on the day of the revelation of that sun of truth however all as hath been observed have exclaimed saying “may god hasten his chastisement he who was the essence of being and lord of the seen and unseen they suspended and committed what made the tablet to weep and the pen to groan and the cries of the sincere to break forth and the tears of the favored ones to flow meditate oshaykh and be fair in what thou sayest the followers ofshaykh ahsá’í shaykhaḥmad have by the aid of god apprehended that which was veiled from the comprehension of others and of which they remained deprived briefly in every age and century differences have arisen in the days of the manifestation of the daysprings of revelation and the dawning places of inspiration and the repositories of divine knowledge differences which have been caused and provoked by lying and impious souls to expatiate on this is not permissible thou art thyself better acquainted and more familiar with the idle fancies of the superstitious and the vain imaginings of the doubters in this day this wronged one requesteth thee and the other divines who have drunk of the cup of the knowledge of god and are illumined by the shining words of the daystar of justice to appoint some person without informing any one and despatch him to these regions and enable him to remain while in the island of cyprus and associate with mírzá yaḥyá perchance he may become aware of the fundamentals of this faith and of the source of the divine laws and commandments wert thou to ponder while thou wouldst bear witness unto the wisdom and the power and the sovereignty of god exalted be his glory the few who were unaware of this cause and had not met us have spoken in such manner that all things and those souls who are well assured pleased and pleasing unto god have testified unto the imposture of these heedless ones wert thou now to exert thyself the truth of this cause would be made apparent unto mankind and the people would be delivered from this grievous and oppressive darkness who else but bahá can speak forth before the face of men and who else but he can have the power to pronounce that which he was bidden by god the lord of hosts this heedless one hath now clung to the practice of rawdih khání traditional lamentation for the imám ḥusayn he—i swear by god—is in evident error for it is the belief of this people that during the revelation of the qá’im the imáms—may the peace of god be upon them—have arisen from their sepulchres this verily is the truth and no doubt is there about it we beseech god to bestow upon the superstitious portion of the living waters of certitude which are streaming from the wellspring of the most sublime pen that all may attain unto that which becometh these days oshaykh while hemmed in by tribulations this wronged one is occupied in setting down these words on every side the flame of oppression and tyranny can be discerned on the one hand tidings have reached us that our loved ones have been arrested in the land of tá ṭihrán and this notwithstanding that the sun and the moon and the land and the sea all testify that this people are adorned with the adornment of fidelity and have clung and will cling to naught except that which can ensure the exaltation of the government and the maintenance of order within the nation and the tranquillity of the people oshaykh we have time and again stated that for number of years we have extended our aid unto his majesty thesháh for years no untoward incident hath occurred in persia the reins of the stirrers of sedition among various sects were held firmly in the grasp of power none hath transgressed his limits by god this people have never been nor are they now inclined to mischief their hearts are illumined with the light of the fear of god and adorned with the adornment of his love their concern hath ever been and now is for the betterment of the world their purpose is to obliterate differences and quench the flame of hatred and enmity so that the whole earth may come to be viewed as one country on the other hand the officials of the persian embassy in the great city constantinople are energetically and assiduously seeking to exterminate these wronged ones they desire one thing and god desireth another consider now what hath befallen the trusted ones of god in every land at one time they have been accused of theft and larceny at another they have been calumniated in manner without parallel in this world answer thou fairly what could be the results and consequences in foreign countries of the accusation of theft brought by the persian embassy against its own subjects if this wronged one was ashamed it was not because of the humiliation it brought this servant but rather because of the shame of its becoming known to the ambassadors of foreign countries how incompetent and lacking in understanding are several eminent officials of the persian embassy “flingest thou thy calumnies into the face of them whom the one true god hath made the trustees of the treasures of his seventh sphere briefly instead of seeking as they should through him who occupieth this sublime station to attain unto the most exalted ranks and to obtain his advice they have exerted themselves and are striving their utmost to put out his light however according to what hath been reported his excellency the ambassador mu’ínu’l mulk mírzá muḥsinkhán—may god assist him—was at that time absent from constantinople such things have happened because it was believed that his majesty thesháh of persia—may the all merciful assist him—was angry with them that have attained and revolve round the sanctuary of wisdom god well knoweth and testifieth that this wronged one hath at all times been cleaving fast unto whatever would be conducive to the glory of both the government and the people god verily is sufficient witness describing the people of bahá the most sublime pen hath sent down these words “these verily are men who if they come to cities of pure gold will consider them not and if they meet the fairest and most comely of women will turn aside thus hath it been sent down by the most sublime pen for the people of bahá on the part of him who is the counsellor the omniscient in the concluding passages of the tablet to his majesty the emperor of paris napoleon iii these exalted words have been revealed “exultest thou over the treasures thou dost possess knowing they shall perish rejoicest thou in that thou rulest span of earth when the whole world in the estimation of the people of bahá is worth as much as the black in the eye of dead ant abandon it unto such as have set their affections upon it and turn thou unto him who is the desire of the world god alone—exalted be his glory—is cognizant of the things which befell this wronged one every day bringeth fresh report of stories current against us at the embassy in constantinople gracious god the sole aim of their machinations is to bring about the extermination of this servant they are however oblivious of the fact that abasement in the path of god is my true glory in the newspapers the following hath been recorded “touching the fraudulent dealings of some of the exiles of ‘akká and the excesses committed by them against several people etc …” unto them who are the exponents of justice and the daysprings of equity the intention of the writer is evident and his purpose clear briefly he arose and inflicted upon me divers tribulations and treated me with injustice and cruelty by god this wronged one would not barter this place of exile for the most sublime habitation in the estimation of men of insight whatsoever befalleth in the path of god is manifest glory and supreme attainment already we have said “glory to thee my god but for the tribulations which are sustained in thy path how could thy true lovers be recognized and were it not for the trials which are borne for love of thee how could the station of such as yearn for thee be revealed such abasement hath been inflicted that each day they spread fresh calumnies this wronged one however cleaveth to seemly patience would that his majesty thesháh of persia would ask for report of the things which befell us in constantinople that he might become fully acquainted with the true facts osháh adjure thee by thy lord the god of mercy to look into this matter with the eye of fairness is there to be found just man who will judge in this day according to that which god hath sent down in his book where is the fair minded person who will equitably consider what hath been perpetrated against us without any clear token or proof oshaykh ponder the behavior of men the inmates of the cities of knowledge and wisdom are sore perplexed asking themselves why it is that theshí‘ih sect which regarded itself as the most learned the most righteous and the most pious of all the peoples of the world hath turned aside in the day of his revelation and hath shown cruelty such as hath never been experienced it is incumbent upon thee to reflect while from the inception of this sect until the present day how great hath been the number of the divines that have appeared none of whom became cognizant of the nature of this revelation what could have been the cause of this waywardness were we to mention it their limbs would cleave asunder it is necessary for them to meditate to meditate for thousand thousand years that haply they may attain unto sprinkling from the ocean of knowledge and discover the things whereof they are oblivious in this day was walking in the land of tá ṭihrán —the dayspring of the signs of thy lord—when lo heard the lamentation of the pulpits and the voice of their supplication unto god blessed and glorified be he they cried out and said “o god of the world and lord of the nations thou beholdest our state and the things which have befallen us by reason of the cruelty of thy servants thou hast created us and revealed us for thy glorification and praise thou dost now hear what the wayward proclaim upon us in thy days by thy might our souls are melted and our limbs are trembling alas alas would that we had never been created and revealed by thee the hearts of them that enjoy near access to god are consumed by these words and from them the cries of such as are devoted to him are raised time and again have we for the sake of god admonished the distinguished divines and summoned them unto the most sublime horizon that perchance they might in the days of his revelation obtain their portion of the ocean of the utterance of him who is the desire of the world and remain not utterly deprived thereof in most of our tablets this most weighty exhortation hath been sent down from the heaven of his all encompassing mercy we said “o concourse of rulers and divines incline your ears unto the voice calling from the horizon of ‘akká verily it aideth you to proceed aright and draweth you nigh unto him and directeth your steps towards the station which god hath made the dayspring of his revelation and the dawning place of his splendors peoples of the world he who is the most great name is come on the part of the ancient king and hath announced unto men this revelation which lay hid in his knowledge and was preserved in the treasury of his protection and was written down by the most sublime pen in the books of god the lord of lords people ofshín shíráz have ye forgotten my loving kindness and my mercy that have surpassed all created things and which proceeded from god who layeth low the necks of men in the kitáb aqdas most holy book the following hath been revealed “say leaders of religion weigh not the book of god with such standards and sciences as are current amongst you for the book itself is the unerring balance established amongst men in this most perfect balance whatsoever the peoples and kindreds possess must be weighed while the measure of its weight should be tested according to its own standard did ye but know it the eye of my loving kindness weepeth sore over you inasmuch as ye have failed to recognize the one upon whom ye have been calling in the daytime and in the night season at even and at morn advance people with snow white faces and radiant hearts unto the blest and crimson spot wherein the tree beyond which there is no passing is calling ‘verily there is none other god beside me the omnipotent protector the self subsisting ye leaders of religion in persia who is the man amongst you that can rival me in vision or insight where is he to be found that dareth to claim to be my equal in utterance or wisdom no by my lord the all merciful all on the earth shall pass away and this is the face of your lord the almighty the well beloved we have decreed people that the highest and last end of all learning be the recognition of him who is the object of all knowledge and yet behold how ye have allowed your learning to shut you out as by veil from him who is the dayspring of this light through whom every hidden thing hath been revealed say this verily is the heaven in which the mother book is treasured could ye but comprehend it he it is who hath caused the rock to shout and the burning bush to lift up its voice upon the mount rising above the holy land and proclaim ‘the kingdom is god’s the sovereign lord of all the all powerful the loving we have not entered any school nor read any of your dissertations incline your ears to the words of this unlettered one wherewith he summoneth you unto god the ever abiding better is this for you than all the treasures of the earth could ye but comprehend it whoso interpreteth what hath been sent down from the heaven of revelation and altereth its evident meaning he verily is of them that have perverted the sublime word of god and is of the lost ones in the lucid book thereupon we heard the groaning of the true faith and said unto it “wherefore true faith do hear thee cry out in the night season and groan in the daytime and utter thy lamentations at daybreak she made reply “o prince of the world that standest revealed in the most great name the heedless ones have hamstrung thy white she camel and caused thy crimson ark to founder and wished to put out thy light and to veil the face of thy cause wherefore hath the voice of my lamentation been lifted up as well as the voice of the lamentation of all created things and yet the people are for the most part unaware the true faith hath laid fast hold in this day on the hem of our bounty and circleth about our person oshaykh enter thou my presence that thou mayest behold what the eye of the universe hath never beheld and hear that which the ear of the whole creation hath never heard that haply thou mayest free thyself from the mire of vague fancies and set thy face towards the most sublime station wherein this wronged one calleth aloud “the kingdom is god’s the almighty the all praised we fain would hope that through thine exertions the wings of men may be sanctified from the mire of self and desire and be made worthy to soar in the atmosphere of god’s love wings that are besmirched with mire can never soar unto this testify they who are the exponents of justice and equity and yet the people are in evident doubt oshaykh protests have been voiced against us from every side—protests such as our pen craveth pardon for setting down nevertheless by reason of our great mercy we have replied unto them in accordance with the understanding of men that haply they may be delivered from the fire of negation and denial and become illumined with the light of affirmation and acceptance equity is rarely to be found and justice hath ceased to exist among others these perspicuous verses have in answer to certain individuals been sent down from the kingdom of divine knowledge “o thou who hast set thy face towards the splendors of my countenance vague fancies have encompassed the dwellers of the earth and debarred them from turning towards the horizon of certitude and its brightness and its manifestations and its lights vain imaginings have withheld them from him who is the self subsisting they speak as prompted by their own caprices and understand not among them are those who have said ‘have the verses been sent down say ‘yea by him who is the lord of the heavens ‘hath the hour come ‘nay more it hath passed by him who is the revealer of clear tokens verily the inevitable is come and he the true one hath appeared with proof and testimony the plain is disclosed and mankind is sore vexed and fearful earthquakes have broken loose and the tribes have lamented for fear of god the lord of strength the all compelling say ‘the stunning trumpet blast hath been loudly raised and the day is god’s the one the unconstrained ‘hath the catastrophe come to pass say ‘yea by the lord of lords ‘is the resurrection come ‘nay more he who is the self subsisting hath appeared with the kingdom of his signs ‘seest thou men laid low ‘yea by my lord the exalted the most high ‘have the tree stumps been uprooted ‘yea more the mountains have been scattered in dust by him the lord of attributes they say ‘where is paradise and where is hell say ‘the one is reunion with me the other thine own self thou who dost associate partner with god and doubtest they say ‘we see not the balance say ‘surely by my lord the god of mercy none can see it except such as are endued with insight ‘have the stars fallen say ‘yea when he who is the self subsisting dwelt in the land of mystery adrianople take heed ye who are endued with discernment all the signs appeared when we drew forth the hand of power from the bosom of majesty and might verily the crier hath cried out when the promised time came and they that have recognized the splendors of sinai have swooned away in the wilderness of hesitation before the awful majesty of thy lord the lord of creation the trumpet asketh ‘hath the bugle been sounded say ‘yea by the king of revelation when he mounted the throne of his name the all merciful darkness hath been chased away by the dawning light of the mercy of thy lord the source of all light the breeze of the all merciful hath wafted and the souls have been quickened in the tombs of their bodies thus hath the decree been fulfilled by god the mighty the beneficent they that have gone astray have said ‘when were the heavens cleft asunder say ‘while ye lay in the graves of waywardness and error among the heedless is he who rubbeth his eyes and looketh to the right and to the left say ‘blinded art thou no refuge hast thou to flee to and among them is he who saith ‘have men been gathered together say ‘yea by my lord whilst thou didst lie in the cradle of idle fancies and among them is he who saith ‘hath the book been sent down through the power of the true faith say ‘the true faith itself is astounded fear ye ye men of understanding heart and among them is he who saith ‘have been assembled with others blind say ‘yea by him that rideth upon the clouds paradise is decked with mystic roses and hell hath been made to blaze with the fire of the impious say ‘the light hath shone forth from the horizon of revelation and the whole earth hath been illumined at the coming of him who is the lord of the day of the covenant the doubters have perished whilst he that turned guided by the light of assurance unto the dayspring of certitude hath prospered blessed art thou who hast fixed thy gaze upon me for this tablet which hath been sent down for thee—a tablet which causeth the souls of men to soar commit it to memory and recite it by my life it is door to the mercy of thy lord well is it with him that reciteth it at eventide and at dawn we verily hear thy praise of this cause through which the mountain of knowledge was crushed and men’s feet have slipped my glory be upon thee and upon whomsoever hath turned unto the almighty the all bounteous the tablet is ended but the theme is unexhausted be patient for thy lord is patient these are verses we sent down previously soon after our arrival in the prison city of ‘akká and we have sent them unto thee that thou mayest be acquainted with what their lying tongues have spoken when our cause came unto them with might and sovereignty the foundations of idle fancies have trembled and the heaven of vain imaginings hath been cleft asunder and yet the people are in doubt and in contention with him they have denied the testimony of god and his proof after he came from the heaven of power with the kingdom of his signs they have cast away what had been prescribed and perpetrated what had been forbidden them in the book they have abandoned their god and clung unto their desires they truly have strayed and are in error they read the verses and deny them they behold the clear tokens and turn aside they truly are lost in strange doubt we have admonished our loved ones to fear god fear which is the fountain head of all goodly deeds and virtues it is the commander of the hosts of justice in the city of bahá happy the man that hath entered the shadow of its luminous standard and laid fast hold thereon he verily is of the companions of the crimson ark which hath been mentioned in the qayyúm asmá say people of god adorn your temples with the adornment of trustworthiness and piety help then your lord with the hosts of goodly deeds and praiseworthy character we have forbidden you dissension and conflict in my books and my scriptures and my scrolls and my tablets and have wished thereby naught else save your exaltation and advancement unto this testify the heavens and the stars thereof and the sun and the radiance thereof and the trees and the leaves thereof and the seas and the waves thereof and the earth and the treasures thereof we pray god to assist his loved ones and aid them in that which beseemeth them in this blest this mighty and wondrous station further in another tablet we have said “o thou who hast fixed thy gaze upon my countenance admonish men to fear god by god this fear is the chief commander of the army of thy lord its hosts are praiseworthy character and goodly deeds through it have the cities of men’s hearts been opened throughout the ages and centuries and the standards of ascendancy and triumph raised above all other standards “we will now mention unto thee trustworthiness and the station thereof in the estimation of god thy lord the lord of the mighty throne one day of days we repaired unto our green island upon our arrival we beheld its streams flowing and its trees luxuriant and the sunlight playing in their midst turning our face to the right we beheld what the pen is powerless to describe nor can it set forth that which the eye of the lord of mankind witnessed in that most sanctified that most sublime that blest and most exalted spot turning then to the left we gazed on one of the beauties of the most sublime paradise standing on pillar of light and calling aloud saying ‘o inmates of earth and heaven behold ye my beauty and my radiance and my revelation and my effulgence by god the true one am trustworthiness and the revelation thereof and the beauty thereof will recompense whosoever will cleave unto me and recognize my rank and station and hold fast unto my hem am the most great ornament of the people of bahá and the vesture of glory unto all who are in the kingdom of creation am the supreme instrument for the prosperity of the world and the horizon of assurance unto all beings thus have we sent down for thee that which will draw men nigh unto the lord of creation this wronged one hath at all times summoned the peoples of the world unto that which will exalt them and draw them nigh unto god from the most sublime horizon there hath shone forth that which leaveth no room unto any one for vacillation repudiation or denial the wayward however have failed to profit therefrom nay it shall only increase their loss oshaykh it is incumbent upon the divines to unite with his majesty thesháh—may god assist him—and to cleave day and night unto that which will exalt the station of both the government and the nation this people are assiduously occupied in enlightening the souls of men and in rehabilitating their condition unto this testifieth that which hath been sent down by the most sublime pen in this lucid tablet how often have things been simple and easy of accomplishment and yet most men have been heedless and busied themselves with that which wasteth their time one day while in constantinople kamál páshá visited this wronged one our conversation turned upon topics profitable unto man he said that he had learned several languages in reply we observed “you have wasted your life it beseemeth you and the other officials of the government to convene gathering and choose one of the divers languages and likewise one of the existing scripts or else to create new language and new script to be taught children in schools throughout the world they would in this way be acquiring only two languages one their own native tongue the other the language in which all the peoples of the world would converse were men to take fast hold on that which hath been mentioned the whole earth would come to be regarded as one country and the people would be relieved and freed from the necessity of acquiring and teaching different languages when in our presence he acquiesced and even evinced great joy and complete satisfaction we then told him to lay this matter before the officials and ministers of the government in order that it might be put into effect throughout the different countries however although he often returned to see us after this he never again referred to this subject although that which had been suggested is conducive to the concord and the unity of the peoples of the world we fain would hope that the persian government will adopt it and carry it out at present new language and new script have been devised if thou desirest we will communicate them to thee our purpose is that all men may cleave unto that which will reduce unnecessary labor and exertion so that their days may be befittingly spent and ended god verily is the helper the knower the ordainer the omniscient god willing persia may be adorned with and attain unto that whereof she hath thus far been deprived say “osháh exert thyself so that all the peoples of the world may be illumined with the effulgent splendors of the sun of thy justice the eyes of this wronged one are turned towards naught save trustworthiness truthfulness purity and all that profiteth men regard him not as traitor glorified art thou my god and my master and my mainstay aid thou his majesty thesháh to execute thy laws and thy commandments and show forth thy justice among thy servants thou art verily the all bounteous the lord of grace abounding the almighty the all powerful the cause of god hath come as token of his grace happy are they who act happy are they who understand happy the man that hath clung unto the truth detached from all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth oshaykh seek thou the shore of the most great ocean and enter then the crimson ark which god hath ordained in the qayyúm asmá for the people of bahá verily it passeth over land and sea he that entereth therein is saved and he that turneth aside perisheth shouldst thou enter therein and attain unto it set thy face towards the kaaba of god the help in peril the self subsisting and say “o my god beseech thee by thy most glorious light and all thy lights are verily glorious thereupon will the doors of the kingdom be flung wide before thy face and thou wilt behold what eyes have never beheld and hear what ears have never heard this wronged one exhorteth thee as he hath exhorted thee before and hath never had any wish for thee save that thou shouldst enter the ocean of the unity of god the lord of the worlds this is the day whereon all created things cry out and announce unto men this revelation through which hath appeared what was concealed and preserved in the knowledge of god the mighty the all praised oshaykh thou hast heard the sweet melodies of the doves of utterance cooing on the boughs of the lote tree of knowledge hearken now unto the notes of the birds of wisdom upraised in the most sublime paradise they verily will acquaint thee with things of which thou wert wholly unaware give ear unto that which the tongue of might and power hath spoken in the books of god the desire of every understanding heart at this moment voice was raised from the lote tree beyond which there is no passing in the heart of the most sublime paradise bidding me relate unto thee that which hath been sent down in the books and tablets and the things spoken by my forerunner who laid down his life for this great announcement this straight path he hath said—and he verily speaketh the truth “i have written down in my mention of him these gem like words ‘no allusion of mine can allude unto him neither anything mentioned in the bayán ’” and further he—exalted and glorified be he—saith concerning this most mighty revelation this great announcement “exalted and glorified is he above the power of any one to reveal him except himself or the description of any of his creatures myself am but the first servant to believe in him and in his signs and to partake of the sweet savors of his words from the first fruits of the paradise of his knowledge yea by his glory he is the truth there is none other god but him all have arisen at his bidding such are the words sung by the dove of truth on the boughs of the divine lote tree well is it with him that hath given ear unto its voice and quaffed from the oceans of divine utterance that lie concealed in each of these words in another connection hath the voice of the bayán called aloud from the loftiest branches he saith—blessed and glorified be he “in the year nine ye will attain unto all good on another occasion he saith “in the year nine ye will attain unto the presence of god these melodies uttered by the birds of the cities of knowledge conform with that which hath been sent down by the all merciful in the qur’án blessed are the men of insight blessed they that attain thereunto oshaykh swear by god the river of mercy floweth and the ocean of utterance surgeth and the sun of revelation shineth forth resplendent with detached heart and dilated breast and an utterly truthful tongue recite thou these sublime words that have been revealed by my forerunner—the primal point he saith—glorified be his utterance—addressing his honor ‘aẓím “this verily is the thing we promised thee ere the moment we answered thy call wait thou until nine will have elapsed from the time of the bayán then exclaim ‘blessed therefore be god the most excellent of makers say this verily is an announcement which none except god hath comprehended ye however will be unaware on that day in the year nine this most great revelation arose and shone forth brightly above the horizon of the will of god none can deny it save he who is heedless and doubteth we pray god to aid his servants to return unto him and beg forgiveness for the things they committed in this vain life he verily is the forgiving the pardoner the all merciful in another connection he saith “i am the first servant to believe in him and in his signs in like manner in the persian bayán he saith “he verily is the one who under all conditions proclaimeth ‘i in very truth am god ’” and so on—blessed and glorified be he that which is meant by divinity and godhead hath previously been stated we have in truth rent the veils asunder and disclosed that which will draw men nigh unto god who layeth low the necks of men happy the man that hath attained unto justice and equity in this grace that hath encompassed all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth as bidden by god the lord of the worlds oshaykh hearken unto the melodies of the gospel with the ear of fairness he saith—glorified be his utterance—prophesying the things that are to come “but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven nor the son but the father by father in this connection is meant god—exalted be his glory he verily is the true educator and the spiritual teacher joel saith “for the day of the lord is great and very terrible and who can abide it firstly in the sublime utterance set forth in the gospel he saith that none is aware of the time of the revelation that none knoweth it except god the all knowing who is cognizant of all secondly he setteth forth the greatness of the revelation likewise in the qur’án he saith “of what ask they of one another of the great announcement this is the announcement the greatness of which hath been mentioned in most of the books of old and of more recent times this is the announcement that hath caused the limbs of mankind to quake except such as god the protector the helper the succorer hath willed to exempt men have indeed with their own eyes witnessed how all men and all things have been thrown into confusion and been sore perplexed save those whom god hath chosen to exempt oshaykh great is the cause and great the announcement patiently and calmly ponder thou upon the resplendent signs and the sublime words and all that hath been revealed in these days that haply thou mayest fathom the mysteries that are hid in the books and mayest strive to guide his servants hearken with thine inner ear unto the voice of jeremiah who saith “oh for great is that day and it hath no equal wert thou to observe with the eye of fairness thou wouldst perceive the greatness of the day incline thine ear unto the voice of this all knowing counsellor and suffer not thyself to be deprived of the mercy that hath surpassed all created things visible and invisible lend an ear unto the song of david he saith “who will bring me into the strong city the strong city is ‘akká which hath been named the most great prison and which possesseth fortress and mighty ramparts oshaykh peruse that which isaiah hath spoken in his book he saith “get thee up into the high mountain zion that bringest good tidings lift up thy voice with strength jerusalem that bringest good tidings lift it up be not afraid say unto the cities of judah ‘behold your god behold the lord god will come with strong hand and his arm shall rule for him ’” this day all the signs have appeared great city hath descended from heaven and zion trembleth and exulteth with joy at the revelation of god for it hath heard the voice of god on every side this day jerusalem hath attained unto new evangel for in the stead of the sycamore standeth the cedar jerusalem is the place of pilgrimage for all the peoples of the world and hath been named the holy city together with zion and palestine they are all included within these regions wherefore hath it been said “blessed is the man that hath migrated to ‘akká amos saith “the lord will roar from zion and utter his voice from jerusalem and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn and the top of carmel shall wither carmel in the book of god hath been designated as the hill of god and his vineyard it is here that by the grace of the lord of revelation the tabernacle of glory hath been raised happy are they that attain thereunto happy they that set their faces towards it and likewise he saith “our god will come and he will not be silent oshaykh reflect upon these words addressed by him who is the desire of the world to amos he saith “prepare to meet thy god israel for lo he that formeth the mountains and createth the wind and declareth unto man what is his thought that maketh the morning darkness and treadeth upon the high places of the earth the lord the god of hosts is his name he saith that he maketh the morning darkness by this is meant that if at the time of the manifestation of him who conversed on sinai anyone were to regard himself as the true morn he will through the might and power of god be turned into darkness he truly is the false dawn though believing himself to be the true one woe unto him and woe unto such as follow him without clear token from god the lord of the worlds isaiah saith “the lord alone shall be exalted in that day concerning the greatness of the revelation he saith “enter into the rock and hide thee in the dust for fear of the lord and for the glory of his majesty and in another connection he saith “the wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose it shall blossom abundantly and rejoice even with joy and singing the glory of lebanon shall be given unto it the splendor of carmel and sharon they shall see the glory of the lord and the splendor of our god these passages stand in need of no commentary they are shining and manifest as the sun and glowing and luminous as light itself every fair minded person is led by the fragrance of these words unto the garden of understanding and attaineth unto that from which most men are veiled and debarred say fear god people and follow not the doubts of such as shout aloud who have broken the covenant of god and his testament and denied his mercy that hath preceded all that are in the heavens and all that are on earth and likewise he saith “say to them that are of fearful heart be strong fear not behold your god this blessed verse is proof of the greatness of the revelation and of the greatness of the cause inasmuch as the blast of the trumpet must needs spread confusion throughout the world and fear and trembling amongst all men well is it with him who hath been illumined with the light of trust and detachment the tribulations of that day will not hinder or alarm him thus hath the tongue of utterance spoken as bidden by him who is the all merciful he verily is the strong the all powerful the all subduing the almighty it is now incumbent upon them who are endowed with hearing ear and seeing eye to ponder these sublime words in each of which the oceans of inner meaning and explanation are hidden that haply the words uttered by him who is the lord of revelation may enable his servants to attain with the utmost joy and radiance unto the supreme goal and most sublime summit—the dawning place of this voice oshaykh wert thou to perceive be it less than needle’s eye the breaths of mine utterance thou wouldst abandon the world and all that is therein and wouldst set thy face towards the lights of the countenance of the desired one briefly in the sayings of him who is the spirit jesus unnumbered significances lie concealed unto many things did he refer but as he found none possessed of hearing ear or seeing eye he chose to conceal most of these things even as he saith “but ye cannot bear them now that dawning place of revelation saith that on that day he who is the promised one will reveal the things which are to come accordingly in the kitáb aqdas and in the tablets to the kings and in the lawḥ ra’ís and in the lawḥ fu’ád most of the things which have come to pass on this earth have been announced and prophesied by the most sublime pen in the kitáb aqdas the following hath been revealed “o land of tá ṭihrán let nothing grieve thee for god hath chosen thee to be the source of the joy of all mankind he shall if it be his will bless thy throne with one who will rule with justice who will gather together the flock of god which the wolves have scattered such ruler will with joy and gladness turn his face towards and extend his favors unto the people of bahá he indeed is accounted in the sight of god as jewel among men upon him rest forever the glory of god and the glory of all that dwell in the kingdom of his revelation these verses were revealed previously now however the following verse hath been sent down “o god my god bahá beseecheth thee and imploreth thee by the lights of thy countenance and the billows of the ocean of thy revelation and the effulgent splendors of the sun of thine utterance to aid thesháh to be fair and equitable if it be thy wish bless thou through him the throne of authority and sovereignty potent art thou to do what pleaseth thee there is none other god but thee who hearest who art ready to answer “rejoice with great joy land of tá ṭihrán for god hath made thee the dayspring of his light inasmuch as within thee was born the manifestation of his glory be thou glad for this name that hath been conferred upon thee—a name through which the daystar of grace hath shed its splendor through which both earth and heaven have been illumined erelong will the state of affairs within thee be changed and the reins of power fall into the hands of the people verily thy lord is the all knowing his authority embraceth all things rest thou assured in the gracious favor of thy lord the eye of his loving kindness shall everlastingly be directed towards thee the day is approaching when thy agitation will have been transmuted into peace and quiet calm thus hath it been decreed in the wondrous book and likewise in the lawḥ fu’ád and in the tablet of the king of paris napoleon iii and in other tablets there hath been revealed that which will lead every fair minded person to testify unto the power and the majesty and the wisdom of god—exalted be his glory were men to observe with the eye of justice they would be made aware of the secret of this blessed verse “neither is there thing green or sere but it is noted in distinct writing and would comprehend it on this day however men’s repudiation of the truth hath prevented them from understanding what hath been sent down in truth by him who is the revealer the ancient of days gracious god perspicuous signs have appeared on every side and yet men are for the most part deprived of the privilege of beholding and of comprehending them we beseech god to bestow his aid that all men may recognize the pearls that lie hid within the shells of the most great ocean and exclaim “praised be thou god of the world concourse of the fair minded observe and reflect upon the billows of the ocean of the utterance and knowledge of god so that ye may testify with your inner and outer tongues that with him is the knowledge of all that is in the book nothing escapeth his knowledge he verily hath manifested that which was hidden when he upon his return mounted the throne of the bayán all that hath been sent down hath and will come to pass word for word upon earth no possibility is left for anyone either to turn aside or protest as fairness however is disgraced and concealed most men speak as prompted by their own idle fancies god my god debar not thy servants from turning their faces towards the light of certitude that hath dawned above the horizon of thy will and suffer them not to be deprived my god of the oceans of thy signs they my lord are thy servants in thy cities and thy slaves in thy lands if thou hast not mercy upon them who then will show them mercy take thou my god the hands of such as have been drowned in the sea of idle fancies and deliver them by thy power and thy sovereignty save them then with the arms of thy might powerful art thou to do what thou willest and in thy right hand are the reins of all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth in like manner the primal point saith “behold ye him with his own eyes were ye to behold him with the eyes of another ye would never recognize and know him this referreth to naught else except this most great revelation well is it with them that judge fairly and likewise he saith “the year old germ that holdeth within itself the potentialities of the revelation that is to come is endowed with potency superior to the combined forces of the whole of the bayán these glad tidings of the bayán and of the books of former times have been repeatedly mentioned under divers names in numerous books that perchance men might judge equitably that which hath arisen and shone forth above the horizon of the will of god the lord of the mighty throne oshaykh tell the people of the bayán “ponder ye these blessed words he saith ‘the whole of the bayán is only leaf amongst the leaves of his paradise be fair people and be not of such as are accounted as lost in the book of god the lord of the worlds the blessed lote tree standeth in this day before thy face laden with heavenly with new and wondrous fruits gaze on it detached from all else save it thus hath the tongue of might and power spoken at this spot which god hath adorned with the footsteps of his most great name and mighty announcement and likewise he saith “ere nine will have elapsed from the inception of this cause the realities of the created things will not be made manifest all that thou hast as yet seen is but the stage from the moist germ until we clothed it with flesh be patient until thou beholdest new creation say ‘blessed therefore be god the most excellent of makers ’” and likewise he hath said regarding the power of this revelation “lawful is it for him whom god will make manifest to reject him who is greatest on earth inasmuch as such one is but creature in his grasp and all things adore him after ḥin cause shall be given unto you which ye shall come to know and also he saith “know thou with absolute certainty and through the firmly established and most irrevocable decree that he—exalted be his glory and magnified be his might and sanctified be his holiness and glorified be his grandeur and lauded be his ways maketh each thing to be known through its own self who then can know him through any one except himself and further he saith—exalted and glorified be he “beware beware lest in the days of his revelation the váḥid of the bayán eighteen letters of the living shut thee out as by veil from him inasmuch as this váḥid is but creature in his sight and beware beware that the words sent down in the bayán shut thee not out as by veil from him and again he—exalted be he—saith “look not upon him with any eye except his own for whosoever looketh upon him with his eye will recognize him otherwise he will be veiled from him shouldst thou seek god and his presence seek thou him and gaze upon him and likewise he saith “better is it for thee to recite but one of the verses of him whom god shall make manifest than to set down the whole of the bayán for on that day that one verse can save thee whereas the entire bayán cannot save thee say people of the bayán be fair be fair and again be fair be fair be ye not of them who have made mention of the manifestation of the cause of god in the daytime and in the night season and who when he through his grace appeared and when the horizon of revelation was illumined pronounced against him such judgment as hath provoked the lamentations of the inmates of the kingdom and of the realm of glory and of such as have circled about the will of god the all knowing the all wise meditate upon these sublime words he saith “i verily am believer in him and in his faith and in his book and in his testimonies and in his ways and in all that proceedeth from him concerning them glory in my kinship with him and pride myself on my belief in him and likewise he saith “o congregation of the bayán and all who are therein recognize ye the limits imposed upon you for such one as the point of the bayán himself hath believed in him whom god shall make manifest before all things were created therein verily do glory before all who are in the kingdom of heaven and earth by god all the atoms of the universe groan and lament at the cruelty perpetrated by the froward among the people of the bayán whither are gone they who are endued with insight and hearing we beseech god—blessed and glorified be he—to summon them and exhort them unto that which will profit them and withhold them from that which will harm them he in truth is the strong the all subduing the almighty and likewise he saith “suffer not yourselves to be shut out as by veil from god after he hath revealed himself for all that hath been exalted in the bayán is but as ring upon my hand and myself am verily but ring upon the hand of him whom god shall make manifest—glorified be his mention he turneth it as he pleaseth for whatsoever he pleaseth and through whatsoever he pleaseth he verily is the help in peril the most high and likewise he saith “were he to make of every one on earth prophet all would in very truth be accounted as prophets in the sight of god and likewise he saith “in the day of the revelation of him whom god shall make manifest all that dwell on earth will be equal in his estimation whomsoever he ordaineth as prophet he verily hath been prophet from the beginning that hath no beginning and will thus remain until the end that hath no end inasmuch as this is an act of god and whosoever is made vicegerent by him shall be vicegerent in all the worlds for this is an act of god for the will of god can in no wise be revealed except through his will nor his wish be manifested save through his wish he verily is the all conquering the all powerful the all highest briefly in every instance he hath stated that which is conducive to the conversion the advancement the exaltation and the guidance of men few unfair ones however have become veil and an insurmountable barrier and debarred the people from turning towards the lights of his countenance we pray god to cast them out by his sovereignty and seize on them with his seizing power he verily is the lord of strength the mighty the all wise and likewise he saith “he—glorified be his mention—resembleth the sun were unnumbered mirrors to be placed before it each would according to its capacity reflect the splendor of that sun and were none to be placed before it it would still continue to rise and set and the mirrors alone would be veiled from its light verily have not fallen short of my duty to admonish that people and to devise means whereby they may turn towards god their lord and believe in god their creator if on the day of his revelation all that are on earth bear him allegiance mine inmost being will rejoice inasmuch as all will have attained the summit of their existence and will have been brought face to face with their beloved and will have recognized to the fullest extent attainable in the world of being the splendor of him who is the desire of their hearts if not my soul will indeed be saddened truly have nurtured all things for this purpose how then can anyone be veiled from him for this have called upon god and will continue to call upon him he verily is nigh ready to answer and likewise he saith “they will even refuse unto that tree which is neither of the east nor of the west the name believer for were they so to name him they would fail to sadden him hath thine ear world heard with what helplessness these words were revealed from the dayspring of the will of him who is the dawning place of all names he saith “i have educated all men that they may recognize this revelation and yet the people of the bayán refuse to concede even the name believer to that blessed tree that belongeth neither to the east nor to the west alas alas for the things which have befallen me by god there befell me at the hands of him whom have nurtured mírzá yaḥyá by day and by night what hath caused the holy spirit and the dwellers of the tabernacle of the grandeur of god the lord of this wondrous day to lament likewise refuting certain disbelievers he saith “for none knoweth the time of the revelation except god whenever it appeareth all must acknowledge the point of truth and render thanks unto god they that have turned aside from me have spoken even as the followers of john the baptist spoke for they too protested against him who was the spirit jesus saying “the dispensation of john hath not yet ended wherefore hast thou come now too they that have repudiated us though they have never known us and have been at all times ignorant of the fundamentals of this cause knowing not from whom it proceeded or what it signifieth have spoken that which hath made all created things to sigh and lament by my life the mute can never confront the one who incarnateth in himself the kingdom of utterance fear god people and peruse then that which hath been sent down with truth in the eighth chapter of the sixth váḥid of the bayán and be not of such as have turned aside he likewise hath commanded “once every nineteen days this chapter should be read that haply they may not be veiled in the time of the revelation of him whom god shall make manifest by considerations foreign to the verses which have been and are still the weightiest of all proofs and testimonies john son of zacharias said what my forerunner hath said “saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than whose shoes am not worthy to bear wherefore hath my forerunner as sign of submissiveness and humility said “the whole of the bayán is only leaf amongst the leaves of his paradise and likewise he saith “i am the first to adore him and pride myself on my kinship with him and yet men the people of the bayán have acted in such manner thatdhi’l jawshan and ibn anas and asbáhí have sought and still seek refuge with god against such deeds this wronged one hath in the face of all religions busied himself day and night with the things that are conducive unto the exaltation of the cause of god whereas those men have clung unto that which is the cause of humiliation and injury and likewise he saith “recognize him by his verses the greater your neglect in seeking to know him the more grievously will ye be veiled in fire ye among the people of the bayán that have turned aside from me ponder upon these most sublime words that have proceeded from the wellspring of the utterance of him who is the point of knowledge hearken ye at this moment unto these words he saith “on that day the daystar of truth will address the people of the bayán and will recite this súrih of the qur’án ‘say ye unbelievers worship not that which ye worship and ye do not worship that which worship shall never worship that which ye worship neither will ye worship that which worship to you be your religion to me my religion ’” gracious god notwithstanding these lucid statements and these shining and luminous tokens all are occupied with their vain imaginings and are unaware of and veiled from the desired one ye that have gone astray awake from the sleep of heedlessness and give ear unto these words of my forerunner he saith “the tree of affirmation by turning aside from him is accounted as the tree of denial and the tree of denial by turning towards him is accounted as the tree of affirmation and likewise he saith “should anyone lay claim unto revelation and fail to produce any proof do not protest and sadden him not briefly this wronged one hath night and day been uttering the words “say ye unbelievers that haply this may be the means of awakening the people and may adorn them with the adornment of fairness and now meditate upon these words which diffuse the breath of despair in his sorrowful invocation unto god the lord of the worlds he saith “glorified art thou my god bear thou witness that through this book have covenanted with all created things concerning the mission of him whom thou shalt make manifest ere the covenant concerning mine own mission had been established sufficient witness art thou and they that have believed in thy signs thou verily sufficest me in thee have placed my trust and thou verily takest count of all things in another connection he saith “o sun like mirrors look ye upon the sun of truth ye verily depend upon it were ye to perceive it ye are all as fishes moving in the waters of the sea veiling yourselves therefrom and yet asking what it is on which ye depend and likewise he saith “i complain unto thee mirror of my generosity against all the other mirrors all look upon me through their own colors these words were sent down from the source of the revelation of the all bounteous and were addressed to siyyid javád known as karbilá’í god testifieth and the world beareth me witness that this siyyid stood by this wronged one and even wrote detailed refutation against them that turned aside from me two communications moreover in which he hath borne witness unto the revelation of the true one and in which the evidences of his turning away from all else but him are clear and manifest have been sent by us to ḥaydar ‘alí the handwriting of the siyyid is unmistakable and is known unto everyone our purpose in doing this was that perchance they that have denied us might attain unto the living waters of acknowledgment and such as have turned aside be illumined with the light of conversion god is my witness that this wronged one hath had no purpose except to convey the word of god blessed are the fair minded and woe betide them that have turned aside they that have turned away from me have schemed many time and acted deceitfully in divers ways they have on one occasion secured picture of this siyyid and pasted it on sheet with that of others surmounted by the portrait of mírzá yaḥyá briefly they have seized upon every means in order to repudiate the true one say “the true one is come evident as the shining sun pity that he should have come into the city of the blind the afore mentioned siyyid admonished the deniers and summoned them unto the most sublime horizon but failed to impress these stones that can take no imprint concerning him they have said things against which he sought refuge with god—exalted be his glory the supplications which he hath sent to this holy court are now in our possession happy are the fair minded ponder now upon the complaint of the primal point against the mirrors that haply men may be awakened and may turn from the left hand of idle fancies and imaginings unto the right hand of faith and certitude and may be made cognizant of that wherefrom they are veiled it is indeed for the purpose of recognizing this most great cause that they have come out of the world of non existence into the world of being and likewise he saith “consecrate thou my god the whole of this tree unto him that from it may be revealed all the fruits created by god within it for him through whom god hath willed to reveal all that he pleaseth by thy glory have not wished that this tree should ever bear any branch leaf or fruit that would fail to bow down before him on the day of his revelation or refuse to laud thee through him as beseemeth the glory of his all glorious revelation and the sublimity of his most sublime concealment and shouldst thou behold my god any branch leaf or fruit upon me that hath failed to bow down before him on the day of his revelation cut it off my god from that tree for it is not of me nor shall it return unto me people of the bayán swear by god this wronged one hath had no other intention except to manifest the cause he was commissioned to reveal were ye to incline your inner ears unto him ye would hear from every limb and member and vein and even from every single hair of this wronged one that which would stir and enrapture the concourse on high and the world of creation hádí the blind fanaticism of former times hath withheld the hapless creatures from the straight path meditate on theshí‘ih sect for twelve hundred years they have cried “o qá’im until in the end all pronounced the sentence of his death and caused him to suffer martyrdom notwithstanding their belief in and their acceptance and acknowledgment of the true one—exalted be his glory—and of the seal of the prophets and of the chosen ones it is now necessary to reflect while that haply that which hath come between the true one and his creatures may be discovered and the deeds which have been the cause of protest and denial be made known hádí we have heard the moaning of the pulpits which as attested by all the divines of the age of this revelation have ascended and from which they have cursed the true one and caused such things to befall him who is the essence of being and his companions as neither the eye nor the ear of the world hath seen or heard thou hast now summoned and art still summoning the people claiming to be his vicegerent and mirror despite thine ignorance of this cause as result of thy not having been in our company every one of this people well knoweth that siyyid muḥammad was but one of our servants in the days when as requested by the imperial ottoman government we proceeded to their capital he accompanied us subsequently he committed that which—i swear by god—hath caused the pen of the most high to weep and his tablet to groan we therefore cast him out whereupon he joined mírzá yaḥyá and did what no tyrant hath ever done we abandoned him and said unto him “begone heedless one after these words had been uttered he joined the order of the mawlavis and remained in their company until the time when we were summoned to depart hádí suffer not thyself to become the instrument for the dissemination of new superstitions and refuse to set up once again sect similar to that of theshí‘ihs reflect how great the amount of blood which hath been spilt thou amongst others who hast laid claim to knowledge and likewise theshí‘ih divines have one and all in the first and ensuing years cursed the true one and decreed that his most holy blood be shed fear god hádí be not willing that men be again afflicted with the vain imaginings of former times fear god and be not of them that act unjustly in these days we have heard that thou hast striven to lay hands on and destroy every copy of the bayán this wronged one requesteth thee to renounce for the sake of god this intention thine intelligence and judgment have never excelled nor do they now excel the intelligence and judgment of him who is the prince of the world god testifieth and beareth me witness that this wronged one hath not perused the bayán nor been acquainted with its contents this much however is known and is clear and indubitable that he hath ordained the book of the bayán to be the foundation of his works fear god and meddle not in matters which far transcend thee for twelve hundred years they that resemble thee have afflicted the haplessshí‘ihs in the pit of vain fancies and idle imaginings finally there appeared on the day of judgment things against which the oppressors of old have sought refuge with the true one apprehend now the cry of him who is the point as raised by his utterance he supplicateth god that if there should appear from this tree—which is his blessed self—any fruit or leaf or branch that would fail to believe in him god should cut it off forthwith and likewise he saith “should any one make statement and fail to support it by any proof reject him not and yet now though supported by hundred books thou hast rejected him and rejoicest therein again repeat and plead with thee to carefully scrutinize that which hath been revealed the breezes of utterance in this revelation are not to be compared with those of former ages this wronged one hath been perpetually afflicted and found no place of safety in which he could peruse either the writings of the most exalted one the báb or those of any one else about two months after our arrival in ‘iráq following the command of his majesty thesháh of persia—may god assist him—mírzá yaḥyá joined us we said unto him “in accordance with the royal command we have been sent unto this place it is advisable for thee to remain in persia we will send our brother mírzá músá to some other place as your names have not been mentioned in the royal decree you can arise and render some service subsequently this wronged one departed from baghdád and for two years withdrew from the world upon our return we found that he had not left and had postponed his departure this wronged one was greatly saddened god testifieth and beareth us witness that we have at all times been busied with the propagation of this cause neither chains nor bonds stocks nor imprisonment have succeeded in withholding us from revealing our self in that land we forbad all mischief and all unseemly and unholy deeds day and night we sent forth our tablets in every direction we had no other purpose except to edify the souls of men and to exalt the blessed word we especially appointed certain ones to collect the writings of the primal point when this was accomplished we summoned mírzá yaḥyá and mírzá vahháb khurásání known as mírzá javád to meet in certain place conforming with our instructions they completed the task of transcribing two copies of the works of the primal point swear by god this wronged one by reason of his constant association with men hath not looked at these books nor gazed with outward eyes on these writings when we departed these writings were in the possession of these two persons it was agreed that mírzá yaḥyá should be entrusted with them and proceed to persia and disseminate them throughout that land this wronged one proceeded at the request of the ministers of the ottoman government to their capital when we arrived in mosul we found that mírzá yaḥyá had left before us for that city and was awaiting us there briefly the books and writings were left in baghdád while he himself proceeded to constantinople and joined these servants god beareth now witness unto the things which have touched this wronged one for after we had so arduously striven he mírzá yaḥyá abandoned the writings and joined the exiles this wronged one was for long period overwhelmed by infinite sorrows until such time when in pursuance of measures of which none but the one true god is aware we despatched the writings unto another place and another country owing to the fact that in ‘iráq all documents must every month be carefully examined lest they rot and perish god however preserved them and sent them unto place which he had previously ordained he verily is the protector the succorer wherever this wronged one went mírzá yaḥyá followed him thou art thyself witness and well knowest that whatever hath been said is the truth the siyyid of iṣfahán however surreptitiously duped him they committed that which caused the greatest consternation would that thou wouldst inquire from the officials of the government concerning the conduct of mírzá yaḥyá in that land aside from all this adjure thee by god the one the incomparable the lord of strength the most powerful to carefully look into the communications addressed in his name to the primal point that thou mayest behold the evidences of him who is the truth as clear as the sun likewise there proceeded from the words of the point of the bayán—may the souls of all else but him be sacrificed for his sake—that which no veil can obscure and which neither the veils of glory nor the veils interposed by such as have gone astray can hide the veils have verily been rent asunder by the finger of the will of thy lord the strong the all subduing the all powerful yea desperate is the state of such as have calumniated me and envied me not long ago it was stated that thou hadst ascribed the authorship of the kitáb íqán and of other tablets unto others swear by god this is grievous injustice others are incapable of apprehending their meaning how much more of revealing them ḥasan mázindarání was the bearer of seventy tablets upon his death these were not delivered unto those for whom they were intended but were entrusted to one of the sisters of this wronged one who for no reason whatever had turned aside from me god knoweth what befell his tablets this sister had never lived with us swear by the sun of truth that after these things had happened she never saw mírzá yaḥyá and remained unaware of our cause for in those days she had been estranged from us she lived in one quarter and this wronged one in another as token however of our loving kindness our affection and mercy we few days prior to our departure visited her and her mother that haply she might quaff from the living waters of faith and attain unto that which would draw her nigh unto god in this day god well knoweth and beareth me witness and she herself testifieth that had no thought whatsoever except this finally she—god be praised—attained unto this through his grace and was adorned with the adornment of love after we were exiled and had departed from ‘iráq to constantinople however news of her ceased to reach us subsequent to our separation in the land of tá ṭihrán we ceased to meet mírzá riḍá qulí our brother and no special news reached us concerning her in the early days we all lived in one house which later on was sold at auction for negligible sum and the two brothers farmán farmá and hisámu’s saltanih purchased it and divided it between themselves after this occurred we separated from our brother he established his residence close to the entrance of masjid sháh whilst we lived near the gate ofshimírán thereafter however that sister displayed toward us for no reason whatever hostile attitude this wronged one held his peace under all conditions however our late brother mírzá muḥammad ḥasan’s daughter—upon him be the glory of god and his peace and his mercy—who had been betrothed to the most great branch ‘abdu’l‑bahá was taken by the sister of this wronged one from núr to her own house and from there sent unto another place some of our companions and friends in various places complained against this as it was very grievous act and was disapproved by all the loved ones of god how strange that our sister should have taken her to her own house and then arranged for her to be sent elsewhere in spite of this this wronged one remained and still remaineth calm and silent word however was said in order to tranquilize our loved ones god testifieth and beareth me witness that whatever hath been said was the truth and was spoken with sincerity none of our loved ones whether in these regions or in that country could believe our sister capable of an act so contrary to decency affection and friendship after such thing had occurred they recognizing that the way had been barred conducted themselves in manner well known unto thyself and others it must be evident therefore how intense was the grief which this act inflicted upon this wronged one later on she threw in her lot with mírzá yaḥyá conflicting reports concerning her are now reaching us nor is it clear what she is saying or doing we beseech god—blessed and glorified be he—to cause her to turn unto him and aid her to repent before the door of his grace he verily is the mighty the forgiving and he is in truth the all powerful the pardoner in another connection he likewise saith “were he to appear this very moment would be the first to adore him and the first to bow down before him be fair people the purpose of the most exalted one the báb was to insure that the proximity of the revelation should not withhold men from the divine and everlasting law even as the companions of john the baptist were prevented from acknowledging him who is the spirit jesus time and again he hath said “suffer not the bayán and all that hath been revealed therein to withhold you from that essence of being and lord of the visible and invisible should any one considering this binding injunction cling unto the bayán such one hath verily passed out of the shadow of the blessed and exalted tree be fair people and be not of the heedless and likewise he saith “let not names shut you out as by veil from him who is their lord even the name of prophet for such name is but creation of his utterance and likewise he in the seventh chapter of the second váḥid saith “o people of the bayán act not as the people of the qur’án have acted for if ye do so the fruits of your night will come to naught and further he saith—glorified be his mention “if thou attainest unto his revelation and obeyest him thou wilt have revealed the fruit of the bayán if not thou art unworthy of mention before god take pity upon thyself if thou aidest not him who is the manifestation of the lordship of god be not then cause of sadness unto him and further he saith—magnified be his station “if thou attainest not unto the presence of god grieve not then the sign of god he will renounce that which can profit them that acknowledge the bayán if ye renounce that which can harm him know however that ye will refuse to do so hádí methinks it is by reason of these indubitable utterances that thou hast determined to blot out the bayán give ear unto the voice of this wronged one and renounce this oppression that hath made the pillars of the bayán to tremble have been neither inchihríq nor in máh kú at the present time statements have been circulated among thy disciples identical with those made by theshí‘ihs who have said that the qur’án is unfinished these people also contend that this bayán is not the original one the copy in the handwriting of siyyid ḥusayn is extant as is also the copy in the handwriting of mírzá aḥmad regardest thou as one wronged he who in this world was never dealt single blow and who was continually surrounded by five of the handmaidens of god and imputest thou unto the true one who from his earliest years until the present day hath been in the hands of his enemies and been tormented with the worst afflictions in the world such charges as the jews did not ascribe unto christ hearken unto the voice of this wronged one and be not of them that are in utter loss and likewise he saith “how many the fires which god converteth into light through him whom god shall make manifest and how numerous the lights which are turned into fire through him behold his appearance even as the sun in the midmost heaven and the disappearance of all even as that of the stars of the night by day hast thou ears world wherewith to hear the voice of the true one and to judge equitably this revelation which as soon as it appeared sinai exclaimed “he that discoursed upon me is come with evident signs and resplendent tokens in spite of every heedless one that hath gone far astray and of every lying calumniator who hath wished to quench the light of god with his calumnies and blot out the signs of god through his malice they verily are of such as have acted unjustly in the book of god the lord of the worlds and likewise he saith “the bayán is from beginning to end the repository of all of his attributes and the treasury of both his fire and his light great god the soul is carried away by the fragrance of this utterance inasmuch as he declareth with infinite sadness that which he perceiveth likewise he saith to the letter of the living mullá báqir—upon him be the glory of god and his loving kindness “haply thou mayest in eight years in the day of his revelation attain unto his presence know thou hádí and be of them that hearken judge thou equitably the companions of god and the testimonies of him who is the truth have for the most part suffered martyrdom thou however art still alive how is it that thou hast been spared swear by god it is because of thy denial whereas the martyrdom of the blessed souls was due to their confession every just and fair minded person will bear witness unto this inasmuch as the cause and motive of both are clear and evident as the sun and likewise he addresseth dayyán who was wronged and suffered martyrdom saying “thou shalt recognize thy worth through the words of him whom god shall make manifest he likewise hath pronounced him to be the third letter to believe in him whom god shall make manifest through these words “o thou who art the third letter to believe in him whom god shall make manifest and likewise he saith “should god however be willing he will make thee known through the words of him whom god shall make manifest dayyán who according to the words of him who is the point—may the souls of all else but him be sacrificed for his sake—is the repository of the trust of the one true god—exalted be his glory—and the treasury of the pearls of his knowledge was made by them to suffer so cruel martyrdom that the concourse on high wept and lamented he it is whom he the báb had taught the hidden and preserved knowledge and entrusted him therewith through his words “o thou who art named dayyán this is hidden and preserved knowledge we have entrusted it unto thee and brought it to thee as mark of honor from god inasmuch as the eye of thine heart is pure thou wilt appreciate its value and wilt cherish its excellence god verily hath deigned to bestow upon the point of the bayán hidden and preserved knowledge the like of which god hath not sent down prior to this revelation more precious is it than any other knowledge in the estimation of god—glorified be he he verily hath made it his testimony even as he hath made the verses to be his testimony this oppressed one who was the repository of the knowledge of god together with mírzá ‘alí akbar one of the relatives of the primal point—upon him be the glory of god and his mercy—and abu’l qásim káshí and several others suffered martyrdom through the decree pronounced by mírzá yaḥyá hádí his book which he hath entitled “mustayqiz” is in thy possession read it although thou hast seen the book peruse it again that haply thou mayest obtain for thyself lofty seat beneath the canopy of truth in like manner siyyid ibráhím concerning whom these words have flowed from the pen of the primal point—magnified be his utterance “o thou who art mentioned as my friend in my scriptures and as my remembrance in my books next to my scriptures and as my name in the bayán”—such one together with dayyán hath been surnamed by him mírzá yaḥyá father of iniquities and father of calamities judge thou fairly how grievous hath been the plight of these oppressed ones and this notwithstanding that one of them was occupied in serving him whilst the other was his guest briefly swear by god the deeds he committed were such that our pen is ashamed to recount reflect while upon the dishonor inflicted upon the primal point consider what hath happened when this wronged one after retirement of two years during which he wandered through the deserts and mountains returned to baghdád as result of the intervention of few who for long time had sought him in the wilderness certain mírzá muḥammad ‘alí of rasht came to see him and related before large gathering of people that which had been done affecting the honor of the báb which hath truly overwhelmed all lands with sorrow great god how could they have countenanced this most grievous betrayal briefly we beseech god to aid the perpetrator of this deed to repent and return unto him he verily is the helper the all wise as to dayyán—upon him be the glory of god and his mercy—he attained our presence in accordance with that which had been revealed by the pen of the primal point we pray god to aid the heedless to turn unto him and such as have turned aside to direct themselves towards him and them that have denied him to acknowledge this cause which no sooner did it appear than all created things proclaimed “he that was hidden in the treasury of knowledge and inscribed by the pen of the most high in his books and his scriptures and his scrolls and his tablets is come in this connection it hath been deemed necessary to mention such traditions as have been recorded regarding the blessed and honored city of ‘akká that haply thou mayest hádí seek path unto the truth and road leading unto god in the name of god the compassionate the merciful the following hath been recorded concerning the merits of ‘akká and of the sea and of aynu’l baqár the spring of the cow which is in ‘akká ‘abdu’l ’aziz son of ‘abdu’ salám hath related unto us that the prophet—may the blessings of god and his salutations be upon him—hath said “‘akká is city in syria to which god hath shown his special mercy ibn mas’úd—may god be pleased with him—hath stated “the prophet—may the blessings of god and his salutations be upon him—hath said ‘of all shores the best is the shore of askelon and ‘akká is verily better than askelon and the merit of ‘akká above that of askelon and all other shores is as the merit of muḥammad above that of all other prophets bring you tidings of city betwixt two mountains in syria in the middle of meadow which is called ‘akká verily he that entereth therein longing for it and eager to visit it god will forgive his sins both of the past and of the future and he that departeth from it other than as pilgrim god will not bless his departure in it is spring called the spring of the cow whoso drinketh draught therefrom god will fill his heart with light and will protect him from the most great terror on the day of resurrection ’” anas son of malík—may god be pleased with him—hath said “the apostle of god—may the blessings of god and his salutations be upon him—hath said ‘by the shore of the sea is city suspended beneath the throne and named ‘akká he that dwelleth therein firm and expecting reward from god—exalted be he—god will write down for him until the day of resurrection the recompense of such as have been patient and have stood up and knelt down and prostrated themselves before him ’” and he—may the blessings of god and his salutations be upon him—hath said “i announce unto you city on the shores of the sea white whose whiteness is pleasing unto god—exalted be he it is called ‘akká he that hath been bitten by one of its fleas is better in the estimation of god than he who hath received grievous blow in the path of god and he that raiseth therein the call to prayer his voice will be lifted up unto paradise and he that remaineth therein for seven days in the face of the enemy god will gather him withkhidr—peace be upon him—and god will protect him from the most great terror on the day of resurrection and he—may the blessings of god —exalted be he—and his salutations be upon him—hath said “there are kings and princes in paradise the poor of ‘akká are the kings of paradise and the princes thereof month in ‘akká is better than thousand years elsewhere the apostle of god—may the blessings of god and his salutations be upon him—is reported to have said “blessed the man that hath visited ‘akká and blessed he that hath visited the visitor of ‘akká blessed the one that hath drunk from the spring of the cow and washed in its waters for the black eyed damsels quaff the camphor in paradise which hath come from the spring of the cow and from the spring of salván siloam and the well of zamzam well is it with him that hath drunk from these springs and washed in their waters for god hath forbidden the fire of hell to touch him and his body on the day of resurrection the prophet—may the blessings of god and his salutations be upon him—is stated to have said “in ‘akká are works of supererogation and acts which are beneficial which god vouchsafed specially unto whomsoever he pleaseth and he that saith in ‘akká ‘glorified be god and praise be unto god and there is none other god but god and most great is god and there is no power nor strength except in god the exalted the mighty god will write down for him thousand good deeds and blot out from him thousand evil deeds and will uplift him thousand grades in paradise and will forgive him his transgressions and whoso saith in ‘akká ‘i beg forgiveness of god god will forgive all his trespasses and he that remembereth god in ‘akká at morn and at eventide in the night season and at dawn is better in the sight of god than he who beareth swords spears and arms in the path of god—exalted be he the apostle of god—may the blessings of god and his salutations be upon him—hath also said “he that looketh

bahá’u’lláh in ‘iráq began under the harshest of conditions and at the lowest ebb in the fortunes of the bábí faith it witnessed however the gradual crystallization of those potent spiritual forces which were to culminate in the declaration of his world embracing mission in in the course of these years and from the city of baghdád there radiated shoghi effendi writes “wave after wave power radiance and glory which insensibly reanimated languishing faith sorely stricken sinking into obscurity threatened with oblivion from it were diffused day and night and with ever increasing energy the first emanations of revelation which in its scope its copiousness its driving force and the volume and variety of its literature was destined to excel that of the báb himself among these early effusions of the pen of glory is lengthy arabic epistle known as the javáhiru’l asrár meaning literally the “gems” or “essences” of mysteries number of themes it enunciates are also elaborated in persian—through different revelatory modes—in the seven valleys and the book of certitude those two immortal volumes which shoghi effendi has characterized respectively as bahá’u’lláh’s greatest mystical composition and his pre eminent doctrinal work undoubtedly the gems of divine mysteries figures among those “tablets revealed in the arabic tongue” which were referred to in the latter volume one of the central themes of the book bahá’u’lláh indicates is that of “transformation” meaning here the return of the promised one in different human guise indeed in prefatory note written above the opening lines of the original manuscript bahá’u’lláh states this treatise was written in reply to seeker who had asked how the promised mihdí could have become transformed into ‘alí muḥammad the báb the opportunity provided by this question was seized to elaborate on number of subjects all of which are of use and benefit both to them that seek and to those who have attained could ye perceive with the eye of divine virtue the seeker alluded to in the above passage was siyyid yúsuf sidihí iṣfahání who at the time was residing in karbilá his questions were presented to bahá’u’lláh through an intermediary and this tablet was revealed in response on the same day number of other important themes are addressed in this work as well the cause of the rejection of the prophets of the past the danger of literal reading of scripture the meaning of the signs and portents of the bible concerning the advent of the new manifestation the continuity of divine revelation intimations of bahá’u’lláh’s own approaching declaration the significance of such symbolic terms as “the day of judgement” “the resurrection” “attainment to the divine presence” and “life and death” and the stages of the spiritual quest through “the garden of search” “the city of love and rapture” “the city of divine unity” “the garden of wonderment” “the city of absolute nothingness” “the city of immortality” and “the city that hath no name or description” the publication of gems of divine mysteries is one of the projects undertaken in fulfilment of the five year plan goal announced in april of “enriching the translations into english from the holy texts” the volume will further deepen the western reader’s appreciation of period infused with potentiality and described by shoghi effendi as “the vernal years of bahá’u’lláh’s ministry” and assist the students of his revelation in gaining more profound insight into its gradual unfoldment the essence of the divine mysteries in the journeys of ascent set forth for those who long to draw nigh unto god the almighty the ever forgiving—blessed be the righteous that quaff from these crystal streams he is the exalted the most high thou whotreadest the path of justice and beholdest the countenance of mercy thine epistle was received thy question was noted and the sweet accents of thy soul were heard from the inmost chambers of thy heart whereupon the clouds of the divine will were raised to rain upon thee the outpourings of heavenly wisdom to divest thee of all that thou hadst acquired aforetime to draw thee from the realms of contradiction unto the retreats of oneness and to lead thee to the sacred streams of his law perchance thou mayest quaff therefrom repose therein quench thy thirst refresh thy soul and be numbered with those whom the light of god hath guided aright in this day encompassed as am at this time by the dogs of the earth and the beasts of every land concealed as remain in the hidden habitation of mine inner being forbidden as may be from divulging that which god hath bestowed upon me of the wonders of his knowledge the gems of his wisdom and the tokens of his power yet am loath to frustrate the hopes of one who hath approached the sanctuary of grandeur sought to enter within the precincts of eternity and aspired to soar in the immensity of this creation at the dawning of the divine decree shall therefore relate unto thee certain truths from among those which god hath vouchsafed unto me this only to the extent that souls can bear and minds endure lest the malicious raise clamour or the dissemblers hoist their banners implore god to graciously aid me in this for unto such as beseech him he is the all bounteous and of those who show mercy he is the most merciful know then that it behoveth thine eminence to ponder from the outset these questions in thy heart what hath prompted the divers peoples and kindreds of the earth to reject the apostles whom god hath sent unto them in his might and power whom he hath raised up to exalt his cause and ordained to be the lamps of eternity within the niche of his oneness for what reason have the people turned aside from them disputed about them risen against and contended with them on what grounds have they refused to acknowledge their apostleship and authority nay denied their truth and reviled their persons even slaying or banishing them thou who hast set foot in the wilderness of knowledge and taken abode within the ark of wisdom not until thou hast grasped the mysteries concealed in that which we shall relate unto thee canst thou hope to attain to the stations of faith and certitude in the cause of god and in those who are the manifestations of his cause the daysprings of his command the treasuries of his revelation and the repositories of his knowledge shouldst thou fail in this thou wouldst be numbered with them that have not striven for the cause of god nor inhaled the fragrance of faith from the raiment of certitude nor scaled the heights of the divine unity nor yet recognized the stations of divine singleness within the embodiments of praise and the essences of sanctity strive then my brother to apprehend this matter that the veils may be lifted from the face of thy heart and that thou mayest be reckoned among them whom god hath graced with such penetrating vision as to behold the most subtle realities of his dominion to fathom the mysteries of his kingdom to perceive the signs of his transcendent essence in this mortal world and to attain station wherein one seeth no distinction amongst his creatures and findeth no flaw in the creation of the heavens and the earth now that the discourse hath reached this exalted and intractable theme and touched upon this sublime and impenetrable mystery know that the christian and jewish peoples have not grasped the intent of the words of god and the promises he hath made to them in his book and have therefore denied his cause turned aside from his prophets and rejected his proofs had they but fixed their gaze upon the testimony of god itself had they refused to follow in the footsteps of the abject and foolish among their leaders and divines they would doubtless have attained to the repository of guidance and the treasury of virtue and quaffed from the crystal waters of life eternal in the city of the all merciful in the garden of the all glorious and within the inner reality of his paradise but as they have refused to see with the eyes wherewith god hath endowed them and desired things other than that which he in his mercy had desired for them they have strayed far from the retreats of nearness have been deprived of the living waters of reunion and the wellspring of his grace and have lain as dead within the shrouds of their own selves through the power of god and his might shall now relate certain passages revealed in the books of old and mention some of the signs heralding the appearance of the manifestations of god in the sanctified persons of his chosen ones that thou mayest recognize the dayspring of this everlasting morn and behold this fire that blazeth in the tree which is neither of the east nor of the west perchance thine eyes may be opened upon attaining the presence of thy lord and thy heart partake of the blessings concealed within these hidden treasuries render thanks then unto god who hath singled thee out for this grace and who hath numbered thee with them that are assured of meeting their lord this is the text of that which was revealed aforetime in the first gospel according to matthew regarding the signs that must needs herald the advent of the one who shall come after him he saith “and woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days…” until the mystic dove singing in the midmost heart of eternity and the celestial bird warbling upon the divine lote tree saith “immediately after the oppression of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory and he shall send his angels with great sound of trumpet in the second gospel according to mark the dove of holiness speaketh in such terms “for in those days shall be affliction such as was not from the beginning of the creation which god created unto this time neither shall be and it singeth later with the same melodies as before without change or alteration god verily is witness unto the truth of my words and in the third gospel according to luke it is recorded “there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring and the powers of heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass know that the kingdom of god hath drawn nigh and in the fourth gospel according to john it is recorded “but when the comforter is come whom will send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me and ye also shall bear witness and elsewhere he saith “but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever have said unto you and “but now go my way to him that sent me and none of you asketh me whither goest thou but because have said these things unto you…” and yet again “nevertheless tell you the truth it is expedient for you that go away for if go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if depart will send him unto you and “howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come such is the text of the verses revealed in the past by him besides whom there is none other god have chosen to be brief for were to recount all the words that have been sent down unto the prophets of god from the realm of his supernal glory and the kingdom of his sovereign might all the pages and tablets of the world would not suffice to exhaust my theme references similar to those mentioned nay even more sublime and exalted have been made in all the books and scriptures of old should it be my wish to recount all that hath been revealed in the past would most certainly be able to do so by virtue of that which god hath bestowed upon me of the wonders of his knowledge and power have however contented myself with that which was mentioned lest thou become wearied in thy journey or feel inclined to turn back or lest thou be overtaken by sadness and sorrow and overcome with despondency trouble and fatigue be fair in thy judgement and reflect upon these exalted utterances inquire then of those who lay claim to knowledge without proof or testimony from god and who remain heedless of these days wherein the orb of knowledge and wisdom hath dawned above the horizon of divinity rendering unto each his due and assigning unto all their rank and measure as to what they can say concerning these allusions verily their meaning hath bewildered the minds of men and that which they conceal of the consummate wisdom and latent knowledge of god even the most sanctified souls have been powerless to uncover should they say “these words are indeed from god and have no interpretation other than their outward meaning” then what objection can they raise against the unbelievers among the people of the book for when the latter saw the aforementioned passages in their scriptures and heard the literal interpretations of their divines they refused to recognize god in those who are the manifestations of his unity the exponents of his singleness and the embodiments of his sanctity and failed to believe in them and submit to their authority the reason was that they did not see the sun darken or the stars of heaven fall to the ground or the angels visibly descend upon the earth and hence they contended with the prophets and messengers of god nay inasmuch as they found them at variance with their own faith and creed they hurled against them such accusations of imposture folly waywardness and misbelief as am ashamed to recount refer to the qur’án that thou mayest find mention of all this and be of them that understand its meaning even to this day do these people await the appearance of that which they have learned from their doctors and imbibed from their divines thus do they say “when shall these signs be made manifest that we may believe but if this be the case how could ye refute their arguments invalidate their proofs and challenge them concerning their faith and their understanding of their books and the sayings of their leaders and should they reply “the books that are in the hands of this people which they call the gospel and attribute to jesus the son of mary have not been revealed by god and proceed not from the manifestations of his self” then this would imply cessation in the abounding grace of him who is the source of all grace if so god’s testimony to his servants would have remained incomplete and his favour proven imperfect his mercy would not have shone resplendent nor would his grace have overshadowed all for if at the ascension of jesus his book had likewise ascended unto heaven then how could god reprove and chastise the people on the day of resurrection as hath been written by the imáms of the faith and affirmed by its illustrious divines ponder then in thine heart matters being such as thou dost witness and as we also witness where canst thou flee and with whom shalt thou take refuge unto whom wilt thou turn thy gaze in what land shalt thou dwell and upon what seat shalt thou abide in what path shalt thou tread and at what hour wilt thou find repose what shall become of thee in the end where shalt thou secure the cord of thy faith and fasten the tie of thine obedience by him who revealeth himself in his oneness and whose own self beareth witness to his unity should there be ignited in thy heart the burning brand of the love of god thou wouldst seek neither rest nor composure neither laughter nor repose but wouldst hasten to scale the highest summits in the realms of divine nearness sanctity and beauty thou wouldst lament as soul bereaved and weep as heart filled with longing nor wouldst thou repair to thy home and abode unless god would lay bare before thee his cause thou who hast soared to the realm of guidance and ascended to the kingdom of virtue shouldst thou desire to apprehend these celestial allusions to witness the mysteries of divine knowledge and to become acquainted with his all encompassing word then it behoveth thine eminence to inquire into these and other questions pertaining to thine origin and ultimate goal from those whom god hath made to be the wellspring of his knowledge the heaven of his wisdom and the ark of his mysteries for were it not for those effulgent lights that shine above the horizon of his essence the people would know not their left hand from their right how much less could they scale the heights of the inner realities or probe the depths of their subtleties we beseech god therefore to immerse us in these surging seas to grace us with the presence of these life bearing breezes and to cause us to abide in these divine and lofty precincts perchance we may divest ourselves of all that we have taken from each other and strip ourselves of such borrowed garments as we have stolen from our fellow men that he may attire us instead with the robe of his mercy and the raiment of his guidance and admit us into the city of knowledge whosoever entereth this city will comprehend every science before probing into its mysteries and will acquire from the leaves of its trees knowledge and wisdom encompassing such mysteries of divine lordship as are enshrined within the treasuries of creation glorified be god its creator and fashioner above all that he hath brought forth and ordained therein by god the sovereign protector the self subsisting the almighty were to unveil to thine eyes the gates of this city which have been fashioned by the right hand of might and power thou wouldst behold that which none before thee hath ever beheld and wouldst witness that which no other soul hath ever witnessed thou wouldst apprehend the most obscure signs and the most abstruse allusions and wouldst clearly behold the mysteries of the beginning in the point of the end all matters would be made easy unto thee fire would be turned into light knowledge and blessings and thou wouldst abide in safety within the court of holiness bereft however of the essence of the mysteries of his wisdom which we have imparted unto thee beneath the veils of these blessed and soul stirring words thou wouldst fail to attain unto even sprinkling of the oceans of divine knowledge or the crystal streams of divine power and wouldst be recorded in the mother book through the pen of oneness and by the finger of god amongst the ignorant nor wouldst thou be able to grasp single word of the book or single utterance of the kindred of god concerning the mysteries of the beginning and the end thou whom we have outwardly never met yet whom we inwardly cherish in our heart be fair in thy judgement and present thyself before him who seeth and knoweth thee even if thou seest and knowest him not can any soul be found to elucidate these words with such convincing arguments clear testimonies and unmistakable allusions as to appease the heart of the seeker and relieve the soul of the listener nay by the one in whose hand is my soul unto none is given to quaff even dewdrop thereof unless he entereth within this city city whose foundations rest upon mountains of crimson coloured ruby whose walls are hewn of the chrysolite of divine unity whose gates are made of the diamonds of immortality and whose earth sheddeth the fragrance of divine bounty having imparted unto thee beneath countless veils of concealment certain hidden mysteries we now return to our elucidation of the books of old that perchance thy feet may not slip and thou mayest receive with complete certitude the portion which we shall bestow upon thee of the billowing oceans of life in the realm of the names and attributes of god it is recorded in all the books of the gospel that he who is the spirit spoke in words of pure light unto his disciples saying “know that heaven and earth may pass away but my words shall never pass away as is clear and evident to thine eminence these words outwardly mean that the books of the gospel will remain in the hands of people till the end of the world that their laws shall not be abrogated that their testimony shall not be abolished and that all that hath been enjoined prescribed or ordained therein shall endure forever my brother sanctify thy heart illumine thy soul and sharpen thy sight that thou mayest perceive the sweet accents of the birds of heaven and the melodies of the doves of holiness warbling in the kingdom of eternity and perchance apprehend the inner meaning of these utterances and their hidden mysteries for otherwise wert thou to interpret these words according to their outward meaning thou couldst never prove the truth of the cause of him who came after jesus nor silence the opponents nor prevail over the contending disbelievers for the christian divines use this verse to prove that the gospel shall never be abrogated and that even if all the signs recorded in their books were fulfilled and the promised one appeared he would have no recourse but to rule the people according to the ordinances of the gospel they contend that if he were to manifest all the signs indicated in the books but decree aught besides that which jesus had decreed they would neither acknowledge nor follow him so clear and self evident is this matter in their sight thou canst indeed hear the learned and the foolish amongst the people voice the same objections in this day saying “the sun hath not risen from the west nor hath the crier cried out betwixt earth and heaven water hath not inundated certain lands the dajjál hath not appeared sufyání hath not arisen nor hath the temple been witnessed in the sun heard with mine own ears one of their divines proclaim “should all these signs come to pass and the long awaited qá’im appear and should he ordain with respect to even our secondary laws aught beyond that which hath been revealed in the qur’án we would assuredly charge him with imposture put him to death and refuse forever to acknowledge him” and other statements such as these deniers make and all this when the day of resurrection hath been ushered in and the trumpet hath been sounded and all the denizens of earth and heaven have been gathered together and the balance hath been appointed and the bridge hath been laid and the verses have been sent down and the sun hath shone forth and the stars have been blotted out and the souls have been raised to life and the breath of the spirit hath blown and the angels have been arrayed in ranks and paradise hath been brought nigh and hell made to blaze these things have all come to pass and yet to this day not single one of these people hath recognized them they all lie as dead within their own shrouds save those who have believed and repaired unto god who rejoice in this day in his celestial paradise and who tread the path of his good pleasure veiled as they remain within their own selves the generality of the people have failed to perceive the sweet accents of holiness inhale the fragrance of mercy or seek guidance as bidden by god from those who are the custodians of the scriptures he proclaimeth and his word verily is the truth “ask ye therefore of them that have the custody of the scriptures if ye know it not nay rather they have turned aside from them and followed instead the sámirí of their own idle fancies thus have they strayed far from the mercy of their lord and failed to attain unto his beauty in the day of his presence for no sooner had he come unto them with sign and testimony from god than the same people who had eagerly awaited the day of his revelation who had called upon him in the daytime and in the night season who had implored him to gather them together in his presence and to grant that they may lay down their lives in his path be led aright by his guidance and illumined by his light—this very people condemned and reviled him and inflicted upon him such cruelties as transcend both my capacity to tell and thine ability to hear them my very pen crieth out at this moment and the ink weepeth sore and groaneth by god wert thou to hearken with thine inner ear thou wouldst in truth hear the lamentations of the denizens of heaven and wert thou to remove the veil from before thine eyes thou wouldst behold the maids of heaven overcome and the holy souls overwhelmed beating upon their faces and fallen upon the dust alas alas for that which befell him who was the manifestation of the self of god and for that which he and his loved ones were made to suffer the people inflicted upon them what no soul hath ever inflicted upon another and what no infidel hath wrought against believer or suffered at his hand alas alas that immortal being sat upon the darksome dust the holy spirit lamented in the retreats of glory the pillars of the throne crumbled in the exalted dominion the joy of the world was changed into sorrow in the crimson land and the voice of the nightingale was silenced in the golden realm woe betide them for what their hands have wrought and for what they have committed hearken then unto that which the bird of heaven uttered in the sweetest and most wondrous accents and in the most perfect and exalted melodies concerning them—an utterance that shall fill them with remorse from now unto “the day when mankind shall stand before the lord of the worlds” “although they had before prayed for victory over those who believed not yet when there came unto them he of whom they had knowledge they disbelieved in him the curse of god on the infidels such indeed are their condition and attainments in their vain and empty life erelong shall they be cast into the fire of affliction and find none to help or succour them be not veiled by aught that hath been revealed in the qur’án or by what thou hast learned from the works of those suns of immaculacy and moons of majesty regarding the perversion of the texts by the fanatical or their alteration by their corruptors by these statements only certain specific and clearly indicated passages are intended in spite of my weakness and poverty would assuredly be able should so desire to expound these passages unto thine eminence but this would divert us from our purpose and lead us astray from the outstretched path it would immerse us in limited allusions and distract us from that which is beloved in the court of the all praised thou who art mentioned in this outspread roll and who amidst the gloomy darkness that now prevaileth hast been illumined by the splendours of the sacred mount in the sinai of divine revelation cleanse thy heart from every blasphemous whispering and evil allusion thou hast heard in the past that thou mayest inhale the sweet savours of eternity from the joseph of faithfulness gain admittance into the celestial egypt and perceive the fragrances of enlightenment from this resplendent and luminous tablet tablet wherein the pen hath inscribed the ancient mysteries of the names of his lord the exalted the most high perchance thou mayest be recorded in the holy tablets among them that are well assured thou who art standing before my throne and yet remainest unaware thereof know thou that whoso seeketh to scale the summits of the divine mysteries must needs strive to the utmost of his power and capacity for his faith that the pathway of guidance may be made clear unto him and should he encounter one who layeth claim to cause from god and who holdeth from his lord testimony beyond the power of men to produce he must needs follow him in all that he pleaseth to proclaim command and ordain even were he to decree the sea to be land or to pronounce earth to be heaven or that the former lieth above the latter or below it or to ordain any change or transformation for he verily is aware of the celestial mysteries the unseen subtleties and the ordinances of god were the peoples of every nation to observe that which hath been mentioned the matter would be made simple unto them and such words and allusions would not withhold them from the ocean of the names and attributes of god and had the people known this truth they would not have denied god’s favours nor would they have risen against contended with and rejected his prophets similar passages are also to be found in the qur’án should the matter be carefully examined know moreover that it is through such words that god proveth his servants and sifteth them separating the believer from the infidel the detached from the worldly the pious from the profligate the doer of good from the worker of iniquity and so forth thus hath the dove of holiness proclaimed “do men think when they say ‘we believe’ they shall be let alone and not be put to proof it behoveth him who is wayfarer in the path of god and wanderer in his way to detach himself from all who are in the heavens and on the earth he must renounce all save god that perchance the portals of mercy may be unlocked before his face and the breezes of providence may waft over him and when he hath inscribed upon his soul that which we have vouchsafed unto him of the quintessence of inner meaning and explanation he will fathom all the secrets of these allusions and god shall bestow upon his heart divine tranquillity and cause him to be of them that are at peace with themselves in like manner wilt thou comprehend the meaning of all the ambiguous verses that have been sent down concerning the question thou didst ask of this servant who abideth upon the seat of abasement who walketh upon the earth as an exile with none to befriend comfort aid or assist him who hath placed his whole trust in god and who proclaimeth at all times “verily we are god’s and to him shall we return know thou that the passages that we have called “ambiguous” appear as such only in the eyes of them that have failed to soar above the horizon of guidance and to reach the heights of knowledge in the retreats of grace for otherwise unto them that have recognized the repositories of divine revelation and beheld through his inspiration the mysteries of divine authority all the verses of god are perspicuous and all his allusions are clear such men discern the inner mysteries that have been clothed in the garment of words as clearly as ye perceive the heat of the sun or the wetness of water nay even more distinctly immeasurably exalted is god above our praise of his loved ones and beyond their praise of him now that we have reached this most excellent theme and attained such lofty heights by virtue of that which hath flowed from this pen through the incomparable favours of god the exalted the most high it is our wish to disclose unto thee certain stations in the wayfarer’s journey towards his creator perchance all that thine eminence hath desired may be revealed unto thee that the proof may be made complete and the blessing abundant know thou of truth that the seeker must at the beginning of his quest for god enter the garden of search in this journey it behoveth the wayfarer to detach himself from all save god and to close his eyes to all that is in the heavens and on the earth there must not linger in his heart either the hate or the love of any soul to the extent that they would hinder him from attaining the habitation of the celestial beauty he must sanctify his soul from the veils of glory and refrain from boasting of such worldly vanities outward knowledge or other gifts as god may have bestowed upon him he must search after the truth to the utmost of his ability and exertion that god may guide him in the paths of his favour and the ways of his mercy for he verily is the best of helpers unto his servants he saith and he verily speaketh the truth “whoso maketh efforts for us in our ways shall we assuredly guide him and furthermore “fear god and god will give you knowledge in this journey the seeker becometh witness to myriad changes and transformations confluences and divergences he beholdeth the wonders of divinity in the mysteries of creation and discovereth the paths of guidance and the ways of his lord such is the station reached by them that search after god and such are the heights attained by those who hasten unto him when once the seeker hath ascended unto this station he will enter the city of love and rapture whereupon the winds of love will blow and the breezes of the spirit will waft in this station the seeker is so overcome by the ecstasies of yearning and the fragrances of longing that he discerneth not his left from his right nor doth he distinguish land from sea or desert from mountain at every moment he burneth with the fire of longing and is consumed by the onslaught of separation in this world he speedeth through the paran of love and traverseth the horeb of rapture now he laugheth now he weepeth sore now he reposeth in peace now he trembleth in fear nothing can alarm him naught can thwart his purpose and no law can restrain him he standeth ready to obey whatsoever his lord should please to decree as to his beginning and his end with every breath he layeth down his life and offereth up his soul he bareth his breast to meet the darts of the enemy and raiseth his head to greet the sword of destiny nay rather he kisseth the hand of his would be murderer and surrendereth his all he yieldeth up spirit soul and body in the path of his lord and yet he doeth so by the leave of his beloved and not of his own whim and desire thou findest him chill in the fire and dry in the sea abiding in every land and treading every path whosoever toucheth him in this state will perceive the heat of his love he walketh the heights of detachment and traverseth the vale of renunciation his eyes are ever expectant to witness the wonders of god’s mercy and eager to behold the splendours of his beauty blessed indeed are they that have attained unto such station for this is the station of the ardent lovers and the enraptured souls and when this stage of the journey is completed and the wayfarer hath soared beyond this lofty station he entereth the city of divine unity and the garden of oneness and the court of detachment in this plane the seeker casteth away all signs allusions veils and words and beholdeth all things with an eye illumined by the effulgent lights which god himself hath shed upon him in his journey he seeth all differences return to single word and all allusions culminate in single point unto this beareth witness he who sailed upon the ark of fire and followed the inmost path to the pinnacle of glory in the realm of immortality “knowledge is one point which the foolish have multiplied this is the station that hath been alluded to in the tradition “i am he himself and he is myself except that am that am and he is that he is in this station were he who is the embodiment of the end to say “verily am the point of the beginning” he would indeed be speaking the truth and were he to say “i am other than him” this would be equally true likewise were he to proclaim “verily am the lord of heaven and earth” or “the king of kings” or “the lord of the realm above” or muḥammad or ‘alí or their descendants or aught else he would indeed be proclaiming the truth of god he verily ruleth over all created things and standeth supreme above all besides him hast thou not heard what hath been said aforetime “muḥammad is our first muḥammad our last muḥammad our all” and elsewhere “they all proceed from the same light” in this station the truth of the unity of god and of the signs of his sanctity is established thou shalt indeed see them all rising above the bosom of god’s might and embraced in the arms of his mercy nor can any distinction be made between his bosom and his arms to speak of change or transformation in this plane would be sheer blasphemy and utter impiety for this is the station wherein the light of divine unity shineth forth and the truth of his oneness is expressed and the splendours of the everlasting morn are reflected in lofty and faithful mirrors by god were to reveal the full measure of that which he hath ordained for this station the souls of men would depart from their bodies the inner realities of all things would be shaken in their foundations they that dwell within the realms of creation would be dumbfounded and those who move in the lands of allusion would fade into utter nothingness hast thou not heard “no change is there in god’s creation” hast thou not read “no change canst thou find in god’s mode of dealing” hast thou not borne witness to the truth “no difference wilt thou see in the creation of the god of mercy” yea by my lord they that dwell within this ocean they that ride upon this ark witness no change in the creation of god and behold no differences upon his earth and if god’s creation be not prone to change and alteration how then could they who are the manifestations of his own being be subject to it immeasurably exalted is god above all that we may conceive of the revealers of his cause and immensely glorified is he beyond all that they may mention in his regard great god this sea had laid up lustrous pearls in store the wind hath raised wave that casteth them ashore so put away thy robe and drown thyself therein and cease to boast of skill it serveth thee no more if thou be of the inmates of this city within the ocean of divine unity thou wilt view all the prophets and messengers of god as one soul and one body as one light and one spirit in such wise that the first among them would be last and the last would be first for they have all arisen to proclaim his cause and have established the laws of divine wisdom they are one and all the manifestations of his self the repositories of his might the treasuries of his revelation the dawning places of his splendour and the daysprings of his light through them are manifested the signs of sanctity in the realities of all things and the tokens of oneness in the essences of all beings through them are revealed the elements of glorification in the heavenly realities and the exponents of praise in the eternal essences from them hath all creation proceeded and unto them shall return all that hath been mentioned and since in their inmost beings they are the same luminaries and the self same mysteries thou shouldst view their outward conditions in the same light that thou mayest recognize them all as one being nay find them united in their words speech and utterance wert thou to consider in this station the last of them to be the first or conversely thou wouldst indeed be speaking the truth as hath been ordained by him who is the wellspring of divinity and the source of lordship “say call upon god or call upon the all merciful by whichsoever name ye will invoke him for he hath most excellent names for they are all the manifestations of the name of god the dawning places of his attributes the repositories of his might and the focal points of his sovereignty whilst god—magnified be his might and glory—is in his essence sanctified above all names and exalted beyond even the loftiest attributes consider likewise the evidences of divine omnipotence both in their souls and in their human temples that thine heart may be assured and that thou mayest be of them that speed through the realms of his nearness shall restate here my theme that perchance this may assist thee in recognizing thy creator know thou that god—exalted and glorified be he—doth in no wise manifest his inmost essence and reality from time immemorial he hath been veiled in the eternity of his essence and concealed in the infinitude of his own being and when he purposed to manifest his beauty in the kingdom of names and to reveal his glory in the realm of attributes he brought forth his prophets from the invisible plane to the visible that his name “the manifest” might be distinguished from “the hidden” and his name “the last” might be discerned from “the first” and that there may be fulfilled the words “he is the first and the last the seen and the hidden and he knoweth all things thus hath he revealed these most excellent names and most exalted words in the manifestations of his self and the mirrors of his being it is therefore established that all names and attributes return unto these sublime and sanctified luminaries indeed all names are to be found in their names and all attributes can be seen in their attributes viewed in this light if thou wert to call them by all the names of god this would be true as all these names are one and the same as their own being comprehend then the intent of these words and guard it within the tabernacle of thy heart that thou mayest recognize the implications of thine inquiry fulfil them according to that which god hath ordained for thee and thus be numbered with those who have attained unto his purpose all that thou hast heard regarding muḥammad the son of ḥasan —may the souls of all that are immersed in the oceans of the spirit be offered up for his sake—is true beyond the shadow of doubt and we all verily bear allegiance unto him but the imáms of the faith have fixed his abode in the city of jábulqá which they have depicted in strange and marvellous signs to interpret this city according to the literal meaning of the tradition would indeed prove impossible nor can such city ever be found wert thou to search the uttermost corners of the earth nay probe its length and breadth for as long as god’s eternity hath lasted and his sovereignty will endure thou wouldst never find city such as they have described for the entirety of the earth could neither contain nor encompass it if thou wouldst lead me unto this city could assuredly lead thee unto this holy being whom the people have conceived according to what they possess and not to that which pertaineth unto him since this is not in thy power thou hast no recourse but to interpret symbolically the accounts and traditions that have been reported from these luminous souls and as such an interpretation is needed for the traditions pertaining to the aforementioned city so too is it required for this holy being when thou hast understood this interpretation thou shalt no longer stand in need of “transformation” or aught else know then that inasmuch as all the prophets are but one and the same soul spirit name and attribute thou must likewise see them all as bearing the name muḥammad and as being the son of ḥasan as having appeared from the jábulqá of god’s power and from the jábulṣá of his mercy for by jábulqá is meant none other than the treasure houses of eternity in the all highest heaven and the cities of the unseen in the supernal realm we bear witness that muḥammad the son of ḥasan was indeed in jábulqá and appeared therefrom likewise he whom god shall make manifest abideth in that city until such time as god will have established him upon the seat of his sovereignty we verily acknowledge this truth and bear allegiance unto each and every one of them we have chosen here to be brief in our elucidation of the meanings of jábulqá but if thou be of them that truly believe thou shalt indeed comprehend all the true meanings of the mysteries enshrined within these tablets but as to him who appeared in the year sixty he standeth in need of neither transformation nor interpretation for his name was muḥammad and he was descendent of the imáms of the faith thus it can be truly said of him that he was the son of ḥasan as is undoubtedly clear and evident unto thine eminence nay he it is who fashioned that name and created it for himself were ye to observe with the eye of god it is our wish at this juncture to digress from our theme to recount that which befell the point of the qur’án and to extol his remembrance that perchance thou mayest gain into all things an insight born of him who is the almighty the incomparable consider and reflect upon his days when god raised him up to promote his cause and to stand as the representative of his own self witness how he was assailed denied and denounced by all how when he set foot in the streets and marketplaces the people derided him wagged their heads at him and laughed him to scorn how at every moment they sought to slay him such were their doings that the earth in all its vastness was straitened for him the concourse on high bewailed his plight the foundations of existence were reduced to nothingness and the eyes of the well favoured denizens of his kingdom wept sore over him indeed so grievous were the afflictions which the infidels and the wicked showered upon him that no faithful soul can bear to hear them if these wayward souls had indeed paused to reflect upon their conduct recognized the sweet melodies of that mystic dove singing upon the twigs of this snow white tree embraced that which god had revealed unto and bestowed upon them and discovered the fruits of the tree of god upon its branches wherefore then did they reject and denounce him had they not lifted their heads to the heavens to implore his appearance had they not besought god at every moment to honour them with his beauty and sustain them through his presence but as they failed to recognize the accents of god and the divine mysteries and holy allusions enshrined in that which flowed from the tongue of muḥammad and as they neglected to examine the matter in their own hearts and followed instead those priests of error who have hindered the progress of the people in past dispensations and who will continue to do so in future cycles they were thus veiled from the divine purpose failed to quaff from the celestial streams and deprived themselves of the presence of god the manifestation of his essence and the dayspring of his eternity thus did they wander in the paths of delusion and the ways of heedlessness and return to their abode in that fire which feedeth on their own souls these verily are numbered with the infidels whose names have been inscribed by the pen of god in his holy book nor have they ever found or will ever find friend or helper had these souls but clung steadfastly to the handle of god manifested in the person of muḥammad had they turned wholly unto god and cast aside all that they had learned from their divines he would assuredly have guided them through his grace and acquainted them with the sacred truths that are enshrined within his imperishable utterances for far be it from his greatness and his glory that he should turn away seeker at his door cast aside from his threshold one who hath set his hopes on him reject one who hath sought the shelter of his shade deprive one who hath held fast to the hem of his mercy or condemn to remoteness the poor one who hath found the river of his riches but as these people failed to turn wholly unto god and to hold fast to the hem of his all pervading mercy at the appearance of the daystar of truth they passed out from under the shadow of guidance and entered the city of error thus did they become corrupt and corrupt the people thus did they err and lead the people into error and thus were they recorded among the oppressors in the books of heaven now that this evanescent one hath reached this exalted point in the exposition of the inner mysteries the reason for the denial of these uncouth souls will be described briefly that it may serve as testimony unto them that are endued with understanding and insight and be token of my favour unto the concourse of the faithful know then that when muḥammad the point of the qur’án and the light of the all glorious came with perspicuous verses and luminous proofs manifested in such signs as are beyond the power of all existence to produce he bade all men follow this lofty and outstretched path in accordance with the precepts that he had brought from god whoso acknowledged him recognized the signs of god in his inmost being and saw in his beauty the changeless beauty of god the decree of “resurrection” “ingathering” “life” and “paradise” was passed upon him for he who had believed in god and in the manifestation of his beauty was raised from the grave of heedlessness gathered together in the sacred ground of the heart quickened to the life of faith and certitude and admitted into the paradise of the divine presence what paradise can be loftier than this what ingathering mightier and what resurrection greater indeed should soul be acquainted with these mysteries he would grasp that which none other hath fathomed know then that the paradise that appeareth in the day of god surpasseth every other paradise and excelleth the realities of heaven for when god—blessed and glorified is he—sealed the station of prophethood in the person of him who was his friend his chosen one and his treasure amongst his creatures as hath been revealed from the kingdom of glory “but he is the apostle of god and the seal of the prophets” he promised all men that they shall attain unto his own presence in the day of resurrection in this he meant to emphasize the greatness of the revelation to come as it hath indeed been manifested through the power of truth and there is of certainty no paradise greater than this nor station higher should ye reflect upon the verses of the qur’án blessed be he who knoweth of certainty that he shall attain unto the presence of god on that day when his beauty shall be made manifest were to recount all the verses that have been revealed in connection with this exalted theme it would weary the reader and divert us from our purpose the following verse shall therefore suffice us may thine eyes be solaced therewith and mayest thou attain unto that which hath been treasured and concealed therein “it is god who hath reared the heavens without pillars thou canst behold then mounted his throne and imposed laws on the sun and moon each travelleth to its appointed goal he ordereth all things he maketh his signs clear that ye may have firm faith in the presence of your lord ponder then my friend the words “firm faith” that have been mentioned in this verse it saith that the heavens and the earth the throne the sun and the moon all have been created to the end that his servants may have unswerving faith in his presence in his days by the righteousness of god contemplate my brother the greatness of this station and behold the condition of the people in these days fleeing from the countenance of god and his beauty “as though they were affrighted asses” wert thou to reflect upon that which we have revealed unto thee thou wouldst undoubtedly grasp our purpose in this utterance and discover that which we have desired to impart unto thee within this paradise perchance thine eyes may rejoice in beholding it thine ears take delight in hearing that which is recited therein thy soul be enthralled by recognizing it thy heart illumined by comprehending it and thy spirit gladdened by the fragrant breezes that waft therefrom haply thou mayest attain unto the pinnacle of divine grace and abide within the riḍván of transcendent holiness he however who denied god in his truth who turned his back upon him and rebelled who disbelieved and made mischief the verdict of “impiety” “blasphemy” “death” and “fire” was passed upon him for what blasphemy is greater than to turn unto the manifestations of satan to follow the doctors of oblivion and the people of rebellion what impiety is more grievous than to deny the lord on the day when faith itself is renewed and regenerated by god the almighty the beneficent what death is more wretched than to flee from the source of everlasting life what fire is fiercer on the day of reckoning than that of remoteness from the divine beauty and the celestial glory these were the very words and utterances used by the pagan arabs living in the days of muḥammad to dispute with and pronounce judgement against him they said “those who believed in muḥammad dwelt in our midst and associated with us day and night when did they die and when were they raised again to life hearken unto that which was revealed in reply “if ever thou dost marvel marvellous surely is their saying ‘what when we have become dust and mouldering bones shall we be restored in new creation ’” and in another passage “and if thou shouldst say ‘after death ye shall surely be raised again’ the infidels will certainly exclaim ‘this is naught but palpable sorcery ’” thus did they mock and deride him for they had read in their books and heard from their divines the terms “life” and “death” and understood them as this elemental life and physical death and hence when they found not that which their vain imaginings and their false and wicked minds had conceived they hoisted the banners of discord and the standards of sedition and kindled the flame of war god however quenched it through the power of his might as thou seest again in this day with these infidels and evil doers at this hour when the sweet savours of attraction have wafted over me from the everlasting city when transports of yearning have seized me from the land of splendours at the dawning of the daystar of the worlds above the horizon of ‘iráq and the sweet melodies of ḥijáz have brought to mine ears the mysteries of separation have purposed to relate unto thine eminence portion of that which the mystic dove hath warbled in the midmost heart of paradise as to the true meaning of life and death though the task be impossible for were to interpret these words for thee as it hath been inscribed in the guarded tablets all the books and pages of the world could not contain it nor could the souls of men bear its weight shall nonetheless mention that which beseemeth this day and age that it might serve as guidance unto whosoever desireth to gain admittance into the retreats of glory in the realms above to hearken unto the melodies of the spirit intoned by this divine and mystic bird and to be numbered with those who have severed themselves from all save god and who in this day rejoice in the presence of their lord know then that “life” hath twofold meaning the first pertaineth to the appearance of man in an elemental body and is as manifest to thine eminence and to others as the midday sun this life cometh to an end with physical death which is god ordained and inescapable reality that life however which is mentioned in the books of the prophets and the chosen ones of god is the life of knowledge that is to say the servant’s recognition of the sign of the splendours wherewith he who is the source of all splendour hath himself invested him and his certitude of attaining unto the presence of god through the manifestations of his cause this is that blessed and everlasting life that perisheth not whosoever is quickened thereby shall never die but will endure as long as his lord and creator will endure the first life which pertaineth to the elemental body will come to an end as hath been revealed by god “every soul shall taste of death but the second life which ariseth from the knowledge of god knoweth no death as hath been revealed aforetime “him will we surely quicken to blessed life and in another passage concerning the martyrs “nay they are alive and sustained by their lord and from the traditions “he who is true believer liveth both in this world and in the world to come numerous examples of similar words are to be found in the books of god and of the embodiments of his justice for the sake of brevity however we have contented ourself with the above passages my brother forsake thine own desires turn thy face unto thy lord and walk not in the footsteps of those who have taken their corrupt inclinations for their god that perchance thou mayest find shelter in the heart of existence beneath the redeeming shadow of him who traineth all names and attributes for they who turn away from their lord in this day are in truth accounted amongst the dead though to outward seeming they may walk upon the earth amongst the deaf though they may hear and amongst the blind though they may see as hath been clearly stated by him who is the lord of the day of reckoning “hearts have they with which they understand not and eyes have they with which they see not …” they walk the edge of treacherous bank and tread the brink of fiery abyss they partake not of the billows of this surging and treasure laden ocean but disport themselves with their own idle words in this connection we will relate unto thee that which was revealed of old concerning “life” that perchance it may turn thee away from the promptings of self deliver thee from the narrow confines of thy prison in this gloomy plane and aid thee to become of them that are guided aright in the darkness of this world he saith and he verily speaketh the truth “shall the dead whom we have quickened and for whom we have ordained light whereby he may walk amongst men be like him whose likeness is in the darkness whence he will not come forth this verse was revealed with respect to ḥamzih and abú jahl the former of whom was believer whilst the latter disbelieved most of the pagan leaders mocked and derided it were agitated and clamoured “how did ḥamzih die and how was he restored to his former life were ye to examine carefully the verses of god ye would find many such statements recorded in the book would that pure and stainless hearts could be found that might impart unto them sprinkling from the oceans of knowledge which my lord hath bestowed upon me so that they may soar in the heavens even as they walk upon the earth and speed over the waters even as they course the land and that they may take up their souls in their hands and lay them down in the path of their creator howbeit leave hath not been granted to divulge this mighty secret indeed it hath been from everlasting mystery enshrined within the treasuries of his power and secret concealed within the repositories of his might lest his faithful servants forsake their own lives in the hope of attaining this most great station in the realms of eternity nor shall they who wander in this oppressive darkness ever attain unto it my brother at every juncture we have restated our theme that all that hath been recorded in these verses may by the leave of god be made clear unto thee and that thou mayest become independent of those who are plunged in the darkness of self and who tread the valley of arrogance and pride and be of them that move within the paradise of everlasting life say people the tree of life hath verily been planted in the heart of the heavenly paradise and bestoweth life in every direction how can ye fail to perceive and recognize it it will in truth aid thee to grasp all that this well assured soul hath disclosed unto thee of the essence of the divine mysteries the dove of holiness warbleth in the heaven of immortality and admonisheth thee to array thyself with new vesture wrought of steel to shield thee from the shafts of doubt concealed in the allusions of men saying “except man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit marvel not that said unto thee ye must be born again wing then thy flight unto this divine tree and partake of its fruits gather up that which hath fallen therefrom and guard it faithfully meditate then upon the utterance of one of the prophets as he intimated to the souls of men through veiled allusions and hidden symbols the glad tidings of the one who was to come after him that thou mayest know of certainty that their words are inscrutable to all save those who are endued with an understanding heart he saith “his eyes were as flame of fire” and “brass like were his feet” and “out of his mouth goeth two edged sword” how could these words be literally interpreted were anyone to appear with all these signs he would assuredly not be human and how could any soul seek his company nay should he appear in one city even the inhabitants of the next would flee from him nor would any soul dare approach him yet shouldst thou reflect upon these statements thou wouldst find them to be of such surpassing eloquence and clarity as to mark the loftiest heights of utterance and the epitome of wisdom methinks it is from them that the suns of eloquence have appeared and the stars of clarity have dawned forth and shone resplendent behold then the foolish ones of bygone times and those who in this day await the advent of such being nor would they ever bear allegiance unto him except that he appear in the aforementioned form and as such being will never appear so too will they never believe such indeed is the measure of the understanding of these perverse and ungodly souls how could those who fail to understand the most evident of the evident and the most manifest of the manifest ever apprehend the abstruse realities of the divine precepts and the essence of the mysteries of his everlasting wisdom shall now briefly explain the true meaning of this utterance that thou mayest discover its hidden mysteries and be of them that perceive examine then and judge aright that which we shall reveal unto thee that haply thou mayest be accounted in the sight of god amongst those who are fair minded in these matters know then that he who uttered these words in the realms of glory meant to describe the attributes of the one who is to come in such veiled and enigmatic terms as to elude the understanding of the people of error now when he saith “his eyes were as flame of fire” he alludeth but to the keenness of sight and acuteness of vision of the promised one who with his eyes burneth away every veil and covering maketh known the eternal mysteries in the contingent world and distinguisheth the faces that are obscured with the dust of hell from those that shine with the light of paradise were his eyes not made of the blazing fire of god how could he consume every veil and burn away all that the people possess how could he behold the signs of god in the kingdom of his names and in the world of creation how could he see all things with the all perceiving eye of god thus have we conferred upon him penetrating vision in this day would that ye believe in the verses of god for indeed what fire is fiercer than this flame that shineth in the sinai of his eyes whereby he consumeth all that hath veiled the peoples of the world immeasurably exalted shall god remain above all that hath been revealed in his unerring tablets concerning the mysteries of the beginning and the end until that day when the crier will cry out the day whereon we shall all return unto him as to the words “brass like were his feet” by this is meant his constancy upon hearing the call of god that commandeth him “be thou steadfast as thou hast been bidden he shall so persevere in the cause of god and evince such firmness in the path of his might that even if all the powers of earth and heaven were to deny him he would not waver in the proclamation of his cause nor flee from his command in the promulgation of his laws nay rather he will stand as firm as the highest mountains and the loftiest peaks he will remain immovable in his obedience to god and steadfast in revealing his cause and proclaiming his word no obstacle will hinder him nor will the censure of the froward deter him or the repudiation of the infidels cause him to waver all the hatred the rejection the iniquity and the unbelief that he witnesseth serve but to strengthen his love for god to augment the yearning of his heart to heighten the exultation of his soul and to fill his breast with passionate devotion hast thou ever seen in this world brass stronger or blade sharper or mountain more unyielding than this he shall verily stand upon his feet to confront all the inhabitants of the earth and will fear no one notwithstanding that which as thou well knowest the people are wont to commit glory be to god who hath established him and called him forth potent is god to do what he pleaseth he in truth is the help in peril the self subsisting and further he saith “out of his mouth goeth two edged sword know thou that since the sword is an instrument that divideth and cleaveth asunder and since there proceedeth from the mouth of the prophets and the chosen ones of god that which separateth the believer from the infidel and the lover from the beloved this term hath been so employed and apart from this dividing and separating no other meaning is intended thus when he who is the primal point and the eternal sun desireth by the leave of god to gather together all creation to raise them up from the graves of their own selves and to divide them one from another he shall pronounce but one verse from him and this verse will distinguish truth from error from this day unto the day of resurrection what sword is sharper than this heavenly sword what blade more trenchant than this incorruptible steel that severeth every tie and separateth thereby the believer from the infidel father from son brother from sister and lover from beloved for whoso believeth in that which hath been revealed unto him is true believer and whoso turneth away is an infidel and such an irrevocable separation occurreth between them that they will cease to consort and associate with each other in this world and so it is between father and son for should the son believe and the father deny they will be severed and forever dissociated from each other nay rather thou witnesseth how the son slayeth the father and the father the son consider in the same light all that we have explained and related unto thee wert thou to behold all things with the eye of discernment thou wouldst indeed see that this divine sword doth cleave asunder generations would that ye could understand it all this is by virtue of the word of separation that is manifested on the day of judgement and separation were the people to take heed in the days of their lord nay couldst thou but sharpen thy sight and refine thy heart thou wouldst witness that all the material swords which in every day and age have slain the infidels and waged war against the impious proceed from this divine and invisible sword open then thine eyes that thou mayest behold all that we have revealed to thee and attain unto that which none other hath attained we verily exclaim “praise be to god he who is the lord of the day of reckoning yea inasmuch as these people have failed to acquire true knowledge from its source and wellspring and from the ocean of fresh and soft flowing waters that stream by the leave of god through hearts that are pure and stainless they have been veiled from that which god hath intended by those words and allusions and have remained confined within the prison of their own selves we render thanks unto god for that which he hath bestowed upon us of his grace he it is who hath caused us to be assured of the truth of his faith—a faith which the combined forces of earth and heaven are powerless to resist he it is who hath enabled us to acknowledge him in the day of his presence to testify unto him whom god shall make manifest in the latter resurrection and to be among them that have believed in him ere his appearance that his favour may be made complete unto us and unto all mankind but hear my brother my plaint against them that claim to be associated with god and with the manifestations of his knowledge and yet follow their corrupt inclinations consume the substance of their neighbour are given to wine commit murder defraud and slander each other hurl calumnies against god and are wont to speak falsely the people attribute all these deeds unto us whilst their perpetrators remain shameless before god they cast aside that which he hath enjoined upon them and commit that which he hath forbidden yet it behoveth the people of truth that the signs of humility should shine upon their faces that the light of sanctity should radiate from their countenances that they should walk upon the earth as though they were in the presence of god and distinguish themselves in their deeds from all the dwellers of the earth such must be their state that their eyes should behold the evidences of his might their tongues and hearts make mention of his name their feet be set towards the lands of his nearness and their hands take fast hold upon his precepts and were they to pass through valley of pure gold and mines of precious silver they should regard them as wholly unworthy of their attention these people however have turned aside from all this and placed instead their affections upon that which accordeth with their own corrupt inclinations thus do they roam in the wilderness of arrogance and pride bear witness at this moment that god is wholly quit of them and likewise are we we beseech god to suffer us not to associate with them either in this life or in the life to come he verily is the eternal truth no god is there but him and his might is equal to all things quaff then my brother from the living waters that we have caused to flow in the oceans of these words methinks the seas of grandeur are surging within them and the gems of divine virtue are shining within and upon them divest then thyself of that which debarreth thee from this fathomless crimson sea and to the cry of “in the name of god and by his grace immerse thyself therein let the fear of no one dismay thee trust in the lord thy god for he is sufficient unto whosoever trusteth in him he verily shall protect thee and in him shalt thou abide in safety know thou moreover that in this most hallowed and resplendent city thou shalt find the wayfarer to be lowly before all men and humble before all things for naught doth he behold save that he perceiveth god therein he beholdeth the effulgent glories of god in the lights of his revelation that have encompassed the sinai of creation in this station the wayfarer must not claim the seat of honour in any gathering or walk before others in the desire to vaunt and exalt himself rather must he regard himself as standing at all times in the presence of his lord he must not wish for anyone that which he doth not wish for himself nor speak that which he would not bear to hear spoken by another nor yet desire for any soul that which he would not have desired for himself it befitteth him rather to walk upon the earth with undeviating steps in the kingdom of his new creation know however that the seeker at the outset of his journey witnesseth change and transformation as hath already been mentioned this is undoubtedly the truth as hath been revealed concerning those days “on the day when the earth shall be changed into another earth these are indeed days the like of which no mortal eye hath ever seen blessed is he that attaineth thereunto and realizeth their full worth “we had sent moses with our signs saying unto him ‘bring forth thy people from darkness into light and remind them of the days of god ’” and these are in truth the days of god could ye but know it in this station all changing and varying realities are manifest before thee whosoever denieth this truth hath verily turned aside from the cause of god rebelled against his rule and gainsaid his sovereignty for it is indeed within the power of him who changeth the earth into another earth to transform all that dwell and move thereon wherefore marvel not at how he turneth darkness into light light into darkness ignorance into knowledge error into guidance death into life and life into death it is in this station that the law of transformation taketh effect ponder thereon if thou be of them that tread this path that all thou didst ask of this lowly one may be made plain unto thee and that thou mayest abide within the tabernacle of this guidance for he doeth whatsoever he willeth and ordaineth whatsoever he pleaseth nor shall he be asked of his doings whilst all men will be asked of their every deed my brother in this stage which marketh the beginning of the journey thou shalt behold divers stations and differing signs even as was mentioned in connection with the city of search all these hold true in their respective planes it behoveth thine eminence in this station to consider each created thing in its own place neither abasing nor exalting its true rank for instance if thou wert to reduce the unseen world to the realm of creation this would be an act of sheer blasphemy and the converse would likewise be the essence of impiety wert thou however to describe the unseen world and the realm of creation within their own stations this would be the undoubted truth in other words wert thou to witness any transformation in the realm of the divine unity no greater sin could be conceived in all creation but wert thou to consider transformation in its own place and understand it accordingly no harm could befall thee by my lord notwithstanding all that we have revealed unto thee of the mysteries of utterance and the degrees of exposition methinks have spoken not single letter of the ocean of god’s hidden knowledge and the essence of his inscrutable wisdom god willing this we shall erelong accomplish in its appointed time he verily remembereth all things in their own place and we in truth all yield praise unto him know thou moreover that the bird that taketh flight in the atmosphere of the realm on high will never be able to soar unto the heaven of transcendent holiness nor taste of the fruits which god hath brought forth therein nor quaff from the streams which he hath caused to flow in its midst and were it to partake but drop thereof it would perish forthwith even as thou dost witness in these days with regard to those who profess allegiance unto us and yet perform such deeds utter such words and advance such claims as they have methinks they lie as dead within their own veils comprehend in like manner every station sign and allusion that thou mayest perceive all things in their own place and consider all matters in their proper light for in this station the city of divine unity are to be found those who have entered within the ark of divine guidance and journeyed through the heights of divine unity thou shalt behold the lights of beauty upon their faces and the mysteries of glory in their human temples thou shalt perceive the musk laden fragrance of their words and behold the signs of his sovereignty in all their ways and doings nor wilt thou be veiled by the deeds of them that have failed to quaff from the crystal springs or to attain unto the cities of holiness and who follow their selfish desires and spread disorder in the land all the while believing themselves to be guided aright it is indeed of them that it hath been said “these are the abject and foolish who follow every clamorous impostor and who bend with every changing wind the stages of this journey station and abode are clear and manifest to thee and require no further explanation know then that all thou hast heard and witnessed that daystar of truth the primal point ascribe to himself from the designations of former times is only on account of the weakness of men and the scheme of the world of creation otherwise all names and attributes revolve round his essence and circle about the threshold of his sanctuary for he it is who traineth all names revealeth all attributes conferreth life upon all beings proclaimeth the divine verses and arrayeth the heavenly signs nay shouldst thou gaze with thine inner eye thou wouldst find that all save him fade into utter nothingness and are as thing forgotten in his holy presence “god was alone there was none else besides him he remaineth now what he hath ever been since it hath been established that god—hallowed and glorified be he —was alone and there was none besides him how can the law of change and transformation apply here shouldst thou reflect upon that which we have disclosed unto thee the daystar of guidance would shine resplendent before thee in this everlasting morn and thou wouldst be numbered therein with the pious know moreover that all that we have mentioned concerning these journeys is intended for none but the elect amongst the righteous and shouldst thou spur on the charger of the spirit and traverse the meads of heaven thou wouldst complete all these journeys and discover every mystery in less than the twinkling of an eye my brother if thou be champion of this arena speed within the lands of certitude that thy soul may be delivered in this day from the bondage of misbelief and that thou mayest perceive the sweet savours that waft from this garden verily the perfume laden breezes that carry the fragrance of this city blow over all regions forfeit not thy portion thereof and be not of the heedless how well hath it been said his fragrant breaths diffused in eastern lands could wellto sick ones in the west restore their sense of smell after this heavenly journey and mystical ascent the wayfarer will enter within the garden of wonderment were to disclose unto thee the reality of this station thou wouldst lament and bewail the plight of this servant who remaineth in the hands of these infidels who hath grown perplexed at his plight and is lost in bewilderment in this fathomless ocean they conspire each day to put me to death and seek at every hour to banish me from this land even as they banished me from another land yet this servant standeth ready before them awaiting whatsoever the almighty hath ordained and decreed for us nor do fear any soul encompassed as we may be by such trials and tribulations as are inflicted by the wicked and the malicious and surrounded at this hour by myriad woes and sorrows “noah’s flood is but the measure of the tears have shed and abraham’s fire an ebullition of my soul jacob’s grief is but reflection of my sorrows and job’s afflictions fraction of my calamity were to recount unto thine eminence the dire adversities that have befallen me thou wouldst be so grieved as to forsake the mention of all things and to forget thyself and all that the lord hath created on earth but as this is not our wish have concealed the revelation of the divine decree in the heart of bahá and veiled it from the eyes of all that move in the realm of creation that it may lie hid within the tabernacle of the unseen until such time as god will have revealed its secret “naught in the heavens or on the earth can escape his knowledge and he verily perceiveth all things as we have digressed from our theme let us leave aside these allusions and return to our discussion of this city verily whoso entereth therein shall be saved and whoso turneth aside therefrom will assuredly perish thou who art mentioned in these tablets know thou that he who embarketh upon this journey will marvel at the signs of the power of god and the wondrous evidences of his handiwork bewilderment will seize him from every side even as hath been attested by that essence of immortality from the concourse on high “increase my wonder and amazement at thee god well hath it been said knew not what amazement wasuntil made thy love my cause how amazing would it beif were not amazed by thee in this valley the wayfarers stray and perish ere they attain their final abode gracious god so immense is this valley so vast this city in the kingdom of creation that it seemeth to have neither beginning nor end how great the blessedness of him who completeth his journey therein and who traverseth through the assistance of god the hallowed soil of this heavenly city city in which the favoured ones of god and the pure in heart are overcome with wonder and awe and we say “praise be to god the lord of the worlds and should the servant ascend to even loftier heights quit this mortal world of dust and seek to ascend unto the celestial abode he will then pass from this city into the city of absolute nothingness that is of dying to self and living in god in this station this most exalted habitation this journey of utter self effacement the wayfarer forgetteth his soul spirit body and very being immerseth himself in the sea of nothingness and liveth on earth as one unworthy of mention nor will one find any sign of his existence for he hath vanished from the realm of the visible and attained unto the heights of self abnegation were we to recount the mysteries of this city the dominions of the hearts of men would be laid to waste in the intensity of their longing for this mighty station for this is the station wherein the effulgent glories of the beloved are revealed to the sincere lover and the resplendent lights of the friend are cast upon the severed heart that is devoted to him how can true lover continue to exist when once the effulgent glories of the beloved are revealed how can the shadow endure when once the sun hath shone forth how can devoted heart have any being before the existence of the object of its devotion nay by the one in whose hand is my soul in this station the seeker’s complete surrender and utter effacement before his creator will be such that were he to search the east and the west and traverse land sea mountain and plain he would find no trace of his own self or of any other soul gracious god but for fear of the nimrod of tyranny and for the protection of the abraham of justice would reveal unto thee that which wert thou to abandon self and desire would enable thee to dispense with aught else and to draw nigh unto this city be patient however until such time as god will have proclaimed his cause he verily rewardeth beyond measure them that endure with patience inhale then the sweet savours of the spirit from the garment of hidden meanings and say “o ye that are immersed in the ocean of selflessness hasten to enter the city of immortality if ye seek to ascend its heights and we exclaim “verily we are god’s and to him shall we return from this most august and exalted station and from this most sublime and glorious plane the seeker entereth the city of immortality therein to abide forever in this station he beholdeth himself established upon the throne of independence and the seat of exaltation then will he comprehend the meaning of that which hath been revealed of old concerning the day “whereon god shall enrich all through his abundance” well is it with them that have attained unto this station and drunk their fill from this snow white chalice before this crimson pillar having in this journey immersed himself in the ocean of immortality rid his heart from attachment to aught save him and attained unto the loftiest heights of everlasting life the seeker will see no annihilation either for himself or for any other soul he will quaff from the cup of immortality tread in its land soar in its atmosphere consort with them that are its embodiments partake of the imperishable and incorruptible fruits of the tree of eternity and be forever accounted in the lofty heights of immortality amongst the denizens of the everlasting realm all that existeth in this city shall indeed endure and will never perish shouldst thou by the leave of god enter this sublime and exalted garden thou wouldst find its sun in its noontide glory never to set never to be eclipsed the same holdeth true of its moon its firmament its stars trees and oceans and of all that pertaineth thereunto or existeth therein by him besides whom there is none other god were to recount from this day unto the end that hath no end its wondrous attributes the love that my heart cherisheth for this hallowed and everlasting city would never be exhausted shall however bring my theme to close since time is short and the inquirer impatient and since these secrets are not to be openly divulged save by the leave of god the almighty the all compelling erelong shall the faithful behold in the day of the latter resurrection him whom god shall make manifest descending with this city from the heaven of the unseen together with company of his exalted and favoured angels great therefore is the blessedness of him that attaineth unto his presence and beholdeth his countenance we all verily cherish this hope and exclaim “praise be unto him for verily he is the eternal truth and unto him do we return know moreover that should one who hath attained unto these stations and embarked upon these journeys fall prey to pride and vainglory he would at that very moment come to naught and return to the first step without realizing it indeed they that seek and yearn after him in these journeys are known by this sign that they humbly defer to those who have believed in god and in his verses that they are lowly before those who have drawn nigh unto him and unto the manifestations of his beauty and that they bow in submission to them that are firmly established upon the lofty heights of the cause of god and before its majesty for were they to reach the ultimate object of their quest for god and their attainment unto him they would have but reached that abode which hath been raised up within their own hearts how then could they ever hope to ascend unto such realms as have not been ordained for them or created for their station nay though they journey from everlasting to everlasting they will never attain unto him who is the midmost heart of existence and the axis of the entire creation he on whose right hand flow the seas of grandeur on whose left stream the rivers of might and whose court none can ever hope to reach how much less his very abode for he dwelleth in the ark of fire speedeth in the sphere of fire through the ocean of fire and moveth within the atmosphere of fire how can he who hath been fashioned of contrary elements ever enter or even approach this fire were he to do so he would be instantly consumed know moreover that should the cord of assistance binding this mighty pivot to the dwellers of earth and heaven be severed they would all assuredly perish great god how can the lowly dust ever reach unto him who is the lord of lords immeasurably exalted is god above that which they conceive in their hearts and immensely glorified is he beyond that which they attribute to him yea the seeker reacheth station wherein that which hath been ordained for him knoweth no bounds the fire of love so blazeth in his heart that it seizeth the reins of constraint from his grasp at every moment his love for his lord increaseth and draweth him nearer unto his creator in such wise that if his lord be in the east of nearness and he dwell in the west of remoteness and possess all that earth and heaven contain of rubies and gold he would forsake it all and rush forth to the land of the desired one and shouldst thou find him to be otherwise know assuredly that such man is lying impostor we verily all belong unto him whom god shall make manifest in the latter resurrection and through him shall we be raised again to life in these days inasmuch as we have lifted not the veils that conceal the countenance of the cause of god nor disclosed unto men the fruits of these stations which we have been forbidden to describe thou beholdest them drunk with heedlessness otherwise were the glory of this station to be revealed unto men to an extent smaller than needle’s eye thou wouldst witness them gathering before the threshold of divine mercy and hastening from all sides to the court of nearness in the realms of divine glory we have concealed it however as mentioned before that those who believe may be distinguished from them that deny and that those who turn unto god may be discerned from them that turn aside verily proclaim “there is no power nor strength except in god the help in peril the self subsisting from this station the wayfarer ascendeth unto city that hath no name or description and whereof one heareth neither sound nor mention therein flow the oceans of eternity whilst this city itself revolveth round the seat of eternity therein the sun of the unseen shineth resplendent above the horizon of the unseen sun that hath its own heavens and its own moons which partake of its light and which rise from and set upon the ocean of the unseen nor can ever hope to impart even dewdrop of that which hath been decreed therein as none is acquainted with its mysteries save god its creator and fashioner and his manifestations know moreover that when we undertook to reveal these words and committed some of them to writing it was our intention to elucidate for thine eminence in the sweet accents of the blessed and the well favoured of god all that we had previously mentioned of the words of the prophets and the sayings of the messengers time however was lacking and the traveller who came from thy presence was in great haste and eager to return thus have we cut short our discourse and contented ourself with this much without completing the description of these stages in seemly and befitting manner indeed we have omitted the description of major cities and mighty journeys such was the haste of the courier that we even forsook the mention of the two exalted journeys of resignation and contentment yet should thine eminence reflect upon these brief statements thou wouldst assuredly acquire every knowledge attain unto the object of all learning and exclaim “sufficient are these words unto all creation both visible and invisible even so should the fire of love burn within thy soul thou wouldst ask “is there yet any more and we say

translated by shoghi effendi laudedand glorified art thou lord my god how can make mention of thee assured as am that no tongue however deep its wisdom can befittingly magnify thy name nor can the bird of the human heart however great its longing ever hope to ascend into the heaven of thy majesty and knowledge if describe thee my god as him who is the all perceiving find myself compelled to admit that they who are the highest embodiments of perception have been created by virtue of thy behest and if extol thee as him who is the all wise likewise am forced to recognize that the wellsprings of wisdom have themselves been generated through the operation of thy will and if proclaim thee as the incomparable one soon discover that they who are the inmost essence of oneness have been sent down by thee and are but the evidences of thine handiwork and if acclaim thee as the knower of all things must confess that they who are the quintessence of knowledge are but the creation and instruments of thy purpose exalted immeasurably exalted art thou above the strivings of mortal man to unravel thy mystery to describe thy glory or even to hint at the nature of thine essence for whatever such strivings may accomplish they never can hope to transcend the limitations imposed upon thy creatures inasmuch as these efforts are actuated by thy decree and are begotten of thine invention the loftiest sentiments which the holiest of saints can express in praise of thee and the deepest wisdom which the most learned of men can utter in their attempts to comprehend thy nature all revolve around that center which is wholly subjected to thy sovereignty which adoreth thy beauty and is propelled through the movement of thy pen nay forbid it my god that should have uttered such words as must of necessity imply the existence of any direct relationship between the pen of thy revelation and the essence of all created things far far are they who are related to thee above the conception of such relationship all comparisons and likenesses fail to do justice to the tree of thy revelation and every way is barred to the comprehension of the manifestation of thy self and the dayspring of thy beauty far far from thy glory be what mortal man can affirm of thee or attribute unto thee or the praise with which he can glorify thee whatever duty thou hast prescribed unto thy servants of extolling to the utmost thy majesty and glory is but token of thy grace unto them that they may be enabled to ascend unto the station conferred upon their own inmost being the station of the knowledge of their own selves no one else besides thee hath at any time been able to fathom thy mystery or befittingly to extol thy greatness unsearchable and high above the praise of men wilt thou remain forever there is none other god but thee the inaccessible the omnipotent the omniscient the holy of holies ii thebeginning of all things is the knowledge of god and the end of all things is strict observance of whatsoever hath been sent down from the empyrean of the divine will that pervadeth all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth iii therevelation which from time immemorial hath been acclaimed as the purpose and promise of all the prophets of god and the most cherished desire of his messengers hath now by virtue of the pervasive will of the almighty and at his irresistible bidding been revealed unto men the advent of such revelation hath been heralded in all the sacred scriptures behold how notwithstanding such an announcement mankind hath strayed from its path and shut out itself from its glory say ye lovers of the one true god strive that ye may truly recognize and know him and observe befittingly his precepts this is revelation under which if man shed for its sake one drop of blood myriads of oceans will be his recompense take heed friends that ye forfeit not so inestimable benefit or disregard its transcendent station consider the multitude of lives that have been and are still being sacrificed in world deluded by mere phantom which the vain imaginations of its peoples have conceived render thanks unto god inasmuch as ye have attained unto your heart’s desire and been united to him who is the promise of all nations guard ye with the aid of the one true god—exalted be his glory—the integrity of the station which ye have attained and cleave to that which shall promote his cause he verily enjoineth on you what is right and conducive to the exaltation of man’s station glorified be the all merciful the revealer of this wondrous tablet iv thisis the day in which god’s most excellent favors have been poured out upon men the day in which his most mighty grace hath been infused into all created things it is incumbent upon all the peoples of the world to reconcile their differences and with perfect unity and peace abide beneath the shadow of the tree of his care and loving kindness it behooveth them to cleave to whatsoever will in this day be conducive to the exaltation of their stations and to the promotion of their best interests happy are those whom the all glorious pen was moved to remember and blessed are those men whose names by virtue of our inscrutable decree we have preferred to conceal beseech ye the one true god to grant that all men may be graciously assisted to fulfill that which is acceptable in our sight soon will the present day order be rolled up and new one spread out in its stead verily thy lord speaketh the truth and is the knower of things unseen thisis the day whereon the ocean of god’s mercy hath been manifested unto men the day in which the daystar of his loving kindness hath shed its radiance upon them the day in which the clouds of his bountiful favor have overshadowed the whole of mankind now is the time to cheer and refresh the down cast through the invigorating breeze of love and fellowship and the living waters of friendliness and charity they who are the beloved of god in whatever place they gather and whomsoever they may meet must evince in their attitude towards god and in the manner of their celebration of his praise and glory such humility and submissiveness that every atom of the dust beneath their feet may attest the depth of their devotion the conversation carried by these holy souls should be informed with such power that these same atoms of dust will be thrilled by its influence they should conduct themselves in such manner that the earth upon which they tread may never be allowed to address to them such words as these “i am to be preferred above you for witness how patient am in bearing the burden which the husbandman layeth upon me am the instrument that continually imparteth unto all beings the blessings with which he who is the source of all grace hath entrusted me notwithstanding the honor conferred upon me and the unnumbered evidences of my wealth—a wealth that supplieth the needs of all creation—behold the measure of my humility witness with what absolute submissiveness allow myself to be trodden beneath the feet of men …” show forbearance and benevolence and love to one another should anyone among you be incapable of grasping certain truth or be striving to comprehend it show forth when conversing with him spirit of extreme kindliness and goodwill help him to see and recognize the truth without esteeming yourself to be in the least superior to him or to be possessed of greater endowments the whole duty of man in this day is to attain that share of the flood of grace which god poureth forth for him let none therefore consider the largeness or smallness of the receptacle the portion of some might lie in the palm of man’s hand the portion of others might fill cup and of others even gallon measure every eye in this day should seek what will best promote the cause of god he who is the eternal truth beareth me witness nothing whatever can in this day inflict greater harm upon this cause than dissension and strife contention estrangement and apathy among the loved ones of god flee them through the power of god and his sovereign aid and strive ye to knit together the hearts of men in his name the unifier the all knowing the all wise beseech ye the one true god to grant that ye may taste the savor of such deeds as are performed in his path and partake of the sweetness of such humility and submissiveness as are shown for his sake forget your own selves and turn your eyes towards your neighbor bend your energies to whatever may foster the education of men nothing is or can ever be hidden from god if ye follow in his way his incalculable and imperishable blessings will be showered upon you this is the luminous tablet whose verses have streamed from the moving pen of him who is the lord of all worlds ponder it in your hearts and be ye of them that observe its precepts vi behold how the divers peoples and kindreds of the earth have been waiting for the coming of the promised one no sooner had he who is the sun of truth been made manifest than lo all turned away from him except them whom god was pleased to guide we dare not in this day lift the veil that concealeth the exalted station which every true believer can attain for the joy which such revelation must provoke might well cause few to faint away and die he who is the heart and center of the bayán hath written “the germ that holdeth within itself the potentialities of the revelation that is to come is endowed with potency superior to the combined forces of all those who follow me and again he saith “of all the tributes have paid to him who is to come after me the greatest is this my written confession that no words of mine can adequately describe him nor can any reference to him in my book the bayán do justice to his cause whoso hath searched the depths of the oceans that lie hid within these exalted words and fathomed their import can be said to have discovered glimmer of the unspeakable glory with which this mighty this sublime and most holy revelation hath been endowed from the excellence of so great revelation the honor with which its faithful followers must needs be invested can be well imagined by the righteousness of the one true god the very breath of these souls is in itself richer than all the treasures of the earth happy is the man that hath attained thereunto and woe betide the heedless vii verilyi say this is the day in which mankind can behold the face and hear the voice of the promised one the call of god hath been raised and the light of his countenance hath been lifted up upon men it behooveth every man to blot out the trace of every idle word from the tablet of his heart and to gaze with an open and unbiased mind on the signs of his revelation the proofs of his mission and the tokens of his glory great indeed is this day the allusions made to it in all the sacred scriptures as the day of god attest its greatness the soul of every prophet of god of every divine messenger hath thirsted for this wondrous day all the divers kindreds of the earth have likewise yearned to attain it no sooner however had the daystar of his revelation manifested itself in the heaven of god’s will than all except those whom the almighty was pleased to guide were found dumbfounded and heedless thou that hast remembered me the most grievous veil hath shut out the peoples of the earth from his glory and hindered them from hearkening to his call god grant that the light of unity may envelop the whole earth and that the seal “the kingdom is god’s may be stamped upon the brow of all its peoples viii bythe righteousness of god these are the days in which god hath proved the hearts of the entire company of his messengers and prophets and beyond them those that stand guard over his sacred and inviolable sanctuary the inmates of the celestial pavilion and dwellers of the tabernacle of glory how severe therefore the test to which they who join partners with god must needs be subjected ix ḥusayn consider the eagerness with which certain peoples and nations have anticipated the return of imám ḥusayn whose coming after the appearance of the qá’im hath been prophesied in days past by the chosen ones of god exalted be his glory these holy ones have moreover announced that when he who is the dayspring of the manifold grace of god manifesteth himself all the prophets and messengers including the qá’im will gather together beneath the shadow of the sacred standard which the promised one will raise that hour is now come the world is illumined with the effulgent glory of his countenance and yet behold how far its peoples have strayed from his path none have believed in him except them who through the power of the lord of names have shattered the idols of their vain imaginings and corrupt desires and entered the city of certitude the seal of the choice wine of his revelation hath in this day and in his name the self sufficing been broken its grace is being poured out upon men fill thy cup and drink in in his name the most holy the all praised thetime foreordained unto the peoples and kindreds of the earth is now come the promises of god as recorded in the holy scriptures have all been fulfilled out of zion hath gone forth the law of god and jerusalem and the hills and land thereof are filled with the glory of his revelation happy is the man that pondereth in his heart that which hath been revealed in the books of god the help in peril the self subsisting meditate upon this ye beloved of god and let your ears be attentive unto his word so that ye may by his grace and mercy drink your fill from the crystal waters of constancy and become as steadfast and immovable as the mountain in his cause in the book of isaiah it is written “enter into the rock and hide thee in the dust for fear of the lord and for the glory of his majesty no man that meditateth upon this verse can fail to recognize the greatness of this cause or doubt the exalted character of this day—the day of god himself this same verse is followed by these words “and the lord alone shall be exalted in that day this is the day which the pen of the most high hath glorified in all the holy scriptures there is no verse in them that doth not declare the glory of his holy name and no book that doth not testify unto the loftiness of this most exalted theme were we to make mention of all that hath been revealed in these heavenly books and holy scriptures concerning this revelation this tablet would assume impossible dimensions it is incumbent in this day upon every man to place his whole trust in the manifold bounties of god and arise to disseminate with the utmost wisdom the verities of his cause then and only then will the whole earth be enveloped with the morning light of his revelation xi allglory be to this day the day in which the fragrances of mercy have been wafted over all created things day so blest that past ages and centuries can never hope to rival it day in which the countenance of the ancient of days hath turned towards his holy seat thereupon the voices of all created things and beyond them those of the concourse on high were heard calling aloud “haste thee carmel for lo the light of the countenance of god the ruler of the kingdom of names and fashioner of the heavens hath been lifted upon thee seized with transports of joy and raising high her voice she thus exclaimed “may my life be sacrifice to thee inasmuch as thou hast fixed thy gaze upon me hast bestowed upon me thy bounty and hast directed towards me thy steps separation from thee thou source of everlasting life hath well nigh consumed me and my remoteness from thy presence hath burned away my soul all praise be to thee for having enabled me to hearken to thy call for having honored me with thy footsteps and for having quickened my soul through the vitalizing fragrance of thy day and the shrilling voice of thy pen voice thou didst ordain as thy trumpet call amidst thy people and when the hour at which thy resistless faith was to be made manifest did strike thou didst breathe breath of thy spirit into thy pen and lo the entire creation shook to its very foundations unveiling to mankind such mysteries as lay hidden within the treasuries of him who is the possessor of all created things no sooner had her voice reached that most exalted spot than we made reply “render thanks unto thy lord carmel the fire of thy separation from me was fast consuming thee when the ocean of my presence surged before thy face cheering thine eyes and those of all creation and filling with delight all things visible and invisible rejoice for god hath in this day established upon thee his throne hath made thee the dawning place of his signs and the dayspring of the evidences of his revelation well is it with him that circleth around thee that proclaimeth the revelation of thy glory and recounteth that which the bounty of the lord thy god hath showered upon thee seize thou the chalice of immortality in the name of thy lord the all glorious and give thanks unto him inasmuch as he in token of his mercy unto thee hath turned thy sorrow into gladness and transmuted thy grief into blissful joy he verily loveth the spot which hath been made the seat of his throne which his footsteps have trodden which hath been honored by his presence from which he raised his call and upon which he shed his tears “call out to zion carmel and announce the joyful tidings he that was hidden from mortal eyes is come his all conquering sovereignty is manifest his all encompassing splendor is revealed beware lest thou hesitate or halt hasten forth and circumambulate the city of god that hath descended from heaven the celestial kaaba round which have circled in adoration the favored of god the pure in heart and the company of the most exalted angels oh how long to announce unto every spot on the surface of the earth and to carry to each one of its cities the glad tidings of this revelation—a revelation to which the heart of sinai hath been attracted and in whose name the burning bush is calling ‘unto god the lord of lords belong the kingdoms of earth and heaven verily this is the day in which both land and sea rejoice at this announcement the day for which have been laid up those things which god through bounty beyond the ken of mortal mind or heart hath destined for revelation erelong will god sail his ark upon thee and will manifest the people of bahá who have been mentioned in the book of names sanctified be the lord of all mankind at the mention of whose name all the atoms of the earth have been made to vibrate and the tongue of grandeur hath been moved to disclose that which had been wrapt in his knowledge and lay concealed within the treasury of his might he verily through the potency of his name the mighty the all powerful the most high is the ruler of all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth xii bestiryourselves people in anticipation of the days of divine justice for the promised hour is now come beware lest ye fail to apprehend its import and be accounted among the erring xiii considerthe past how many both high and low have at all times yearningly awaited the advent of the manifestations of god in the sanctified persons of his chosen ones how often have they expected his coming how frequently have they prayed that the breeze of divine mercy might blow and the promised beauty step forth from behind the veil of concealment and be made manifest to all the world and whensoever the portals of grace did open and the clouds of divine bounty did rain upon mankind and the light of the unseen did shine above the horizon of celestial might they all denied him and turned away from his face—the face of god himself reflect what could have been the motive for such deeds what could have prompted such behavior towards the revealers of the beauty of the all glorious whatever in days gone by hath been the cause of the denial and opposition of those people hath now led to the perversity of the people of this age to maintain that the testimony of providence was incomplete that it hath therefore been the cause of the denial of the people is but open blasphemy how far from the grace of the all bountiful and from his loving providence and tender mercies it is to single out soul from amongst all men for the guidance of his creatures and on one hand to withhold from him the full measure of his divine testimony and on the other inflict severe retribution on his people for having turned away from his chosen one nay the manifold bounties of the lord of all beings have at all times through the manifestations of his divine essence encompassed the earth and all that dwell therein not for moment hath his grace been withheld nor have the showers of his loving kindness ceased to rain upon mankind consequently such behavior can be attributed to naught save the petty mindedness of such souls as tread the valley of arrogance and pride are lost in the wilds of remoteness walk in the ways of their idle fancy and follow the dictates of the leaders of their faith their chief concern is mere opposition their sole desire is to ignore the truth unto every discerning observer it is evident and manifest that had these people in the days of each of the manifestations of the sun of truth sanctified their eyes their ears and their hearts from whatever they had seen heard and felt they surely would not have been deprived of beholding the beauty of god nor strayed far from the habitations of glory but having weighed the testimony of god by the standard of their own knowledge gleaned from the teachings of the leaders of their faith and found it at variance with their limited understanding they arose to perpetrate such unseemly acts consider moses armed with the rod of celestial dominion adorned with the white hand of divine knowledge and proceeding from the párán of the love of god and wielding the serpent of power and everlasting majesty he shone forth from the sinai of light upon the world he summoned all the peoples and kindreds of the earth to the kingdom of eternity and invited them to partake of the fruit of the tree of faithfulness surely you are aware of the fierce opposition of pharaoh and his people and of the stones of idle fancy which the hands of infidels cast upon that blessed tree so much so that pharaoh and his people finally arose and exerted their utmost endeavor to extinguish with the waters of falsehood and denial the fire of that sacred tree oblivious of the truth that no earthly water can quench the flames of divine wisdom nor mortal blasts extinguish the lamp of everlasting dominion nay rather such water cannot but intensify the burning of the flame and such blasts cannot but ensure the preservation of the lamp were ye to observe with the eye of discernment and walk in the way of god’s holy will and pleasure and when the days of moses were ended and the light of jesus shining forth from the dayspring of the spirit encompassed the world all the people of israel arose in protest against him they clamored that he whose advent the bible had foretold must needs promulgate and fulfill the laws of moses whereas this youthful nazarene who laid claim to the station of the divine messiah had annulled the laws of divorce and of the sabbath day—the most weighty of all the laws of moses moreover what of the signs of the manifestation yet to come these people of israel are even unto the present day still expecting that manifestation which the bible hath foretold how many manifestations of holiness how many revealers of the light everlasting have appeared since the time of moses and yet israel wrapt in the densest veils of satanic fancy and false imaginings is still expectant that the idol of her own handiwork will appear with such signs as she herself hath conceived thus hath god laid hold of them for their sins hath extinguished in them the spirit of faith and tormented them with the flames of the nethermost fire and this for no other reason except that israel refused to apprehend the meaning of such words as have been revealed in the bible concerning the signs of the coming revelation as she never grasped their true significance and to outward seeming such events never came to pass she therefore remained deprived of recognizing the beauty of jesus and of beholding the face of god and they still await his coming from time immemorial even unto this day all the kindreds and peoples of the earth have clung to such fanciful and unseemly thoughts and thus have deprived themselves of the clear waters streaming from the springs of purity and holiness to them that are endowed with understanding it is clear and manifest that when the fire of the love of jesus consumed the veils of jewish limitations and his authority was made apparent and partially enforced he the revealer of the unseen beauty addressing one day his disciples referred unto his passing and kindling in their hearts the fire of bereavement said unto them “i go away and come again unto you and in another place he said “i go and another will come who will tell you all that have not told you and will fulfill all that have said both these sayings have but one meaning were ye to ponder upon the manifestations of the unity of god with divine insight every discerning observer will recognize that in the dispensation of the qur’án both the book and the cause of jesus were confirmed as to the matter of names muḥammad himself declared “i am jesus he recognized the truth of the signs prophecies and words of jesus and testified that they were all of god in this sense neither the person of jesus nor his writings hath differed from that of muḥammad and of his holy book inasmuch as both have championed the cause of god uttered his praise and revealed his commandments thus it is that jesus himself declared “i go away and come again unto you consider the sun were it to say now “i am the sun of yesterday it would speak the truth and should it bearing the sequence of time in mind claim to be other than that sun it still would speak the truth in like manner if it be said that all the days are but one and the same it is correct and true and if it be said with respect to their particular names and designations that they differ that again is true for though they are the same yet one doth recognize in each separate designation specific attribute particular character conceive accordingly the distinction variation and unity characteristic of the various manifestations of holiness that thou mayest comprehend the allusions made by the creator of all names and attributes to the mysteries of distinction and unity and discover the answer to thy question as to why that everlasting beauty should have at sundry times called himself by different names and titles when the unseen the eternal the divine essence caused the daystar of muḥammad to rise above the horizon of knowledge among the cavils which the jewish divines raised against him was that after moses no prophet should be sent of god yea mention hath been made in the scriptures of soul who must needs be made manifest and who will advance the faith and promote the interests of the people of moses so that the law of the mosaic dispensation may encompass the whole earth thus hath the king of eternal glory referred in his book to the words uttered by those wanderers in the vale of remoteness and error “‘the hand of god say the jews ‘is chained up chained up be their own hands and for that which they have said they were accursed nay outstretched are both his hands “the hand of god is above their hands although the commentators of the qur’án have related in divers manners the circumstances attending the revelation of this verse yet thou shouldst endeavor to apprehend the purpose thereof he saith how false is that which the jews have imagined how can the hand of him who is the king in truth who caused the countenance of moses to be made manifest and conferred upon him the robe of prophethood—how can the hand of such one be chained and fettered how can he be conceived as powerless to raise up yet another messenger after moses behold the absurdity of their saying how far it hath strayed from the path of knowledge and understanding observe how in this day also all these people have occupied themselves with such foolish absurdities for over thousand years they have been reciting this verse and unwittingly pronouncing their censure against the jews utterly unaware that they themselves openly and privily are voicing the sentiments and belief of the jewish people thou art surely aware of their idle contention that all revelation is ended that the portals of divine mercy are closed that from the daysprings of eternal holiness no sun shall rise again that the ocean of everlasting bounty is forever stilled and that out of the tabernacle of ancient glory the messengers of god have ceased to be made manifest such is the measure of the understanding of these small minded contemptible people these people have imagined that the flow of god’s all encompassing grace and plenteous mercies the cessation of which no mind can contemplate has been halted from every side they have risen and girded up the loins of tyranny and exerted the utmost endeavor to quench with the bitter waters of their vain fancy the flame of god’s burning bush oblivious that the globe of power shall within its own mighty stronghold protect the lamp of god behold how the sovereignty of muḥammad the messenger of god is today apparent and manifest amongst the people you are well aware of what befell his faith in the early days of his dispensation what woeful sufferings did the hand of the infidel and erring the divines of that age and their associates inflict upon that spiritual essence that most pure and holy being how abundant the thorns and briars which they have strewn over his path it is evident that that wretched generation in their wicked and satanic fancy regarded every injury to that immortal being as means to the attainment of an abiding felicity inasmuch as the recognized divines of that age such as ‘abdu’lláh ubayy ‘abú ‘ámir the hermit ka’b ibn ashraf and naḍr ibn ḥárith all treated him as an impostor and pronounced him lunatic and calumniator such sore accusations they brought against him that in recounting them god forbiddeth the ink to flow our pen to move or the page to bear them these malicious imputations provoked the people to arise and torment him and how fierce that torment if the divines of the age be its chief instigators if they denounce him to their followers cast him out from their midst and declare him miscreant hath not the same befallen this servant and been witnessed by all for this reason did muḥammad cry out “no prophet of god hath suffered such harm as have suffered and in the qur’án are recorded all the calumnies and reproaches uttered against him as well as all the afflictions which he suffered refer ye thereunto that haply ye may be informed of that which hath befallen his revelation so grievous was his plight that for time all ceased to hold intercourse with him and his companions whoever associated with him fell victim to the relentless cruelty of his enemies consider how great is the change today behold how many are the sovereigns who bow the knee before his name how numerous the nations and kingdoms who have sought the shelter of his shadow who bear allegiance to his faith and pride themselves therein from the pulpit top there ascendeth today the words of praise which in utter lowliness glorify his blessed name and from the heights of minarets there resoundeth the call that summoneth the concourse of his people to adore him even those kings of the earth who have refused to embrace his faith and to put off the garment of unbelief nonetheless confess and acknowledge the greatness and overpowering majesty of that daystar of loving kindness such is his earthly sovereignty the evidences of which thou dost on every side behold this sovereignty must needs be revealed and established either in the lifetime of every manifestation of god or after his ascension unto his true habitation in the realms above it is evident that the changes brought about in every dispensation constitute the dark clouds that intervene between the eye of man’s understanding and the divine luminary which shineth forth from the dayspring of the divine essence consider how men for generations have been blindly imitating their fathers and have been trained according to such ways and manners as have been laid down by the dictates of their faith were these men therefore to discover suddenly that man who hath been living in their midst who with respect to every human limitation hath been their equal had risen to abolish every established principle imposed by their faith—principles by which for centuries they have been disciplined and every opposer and denier of which they have come to regard as infidel profligate and wicked—they would of certainty be veiled and hindered from acknowledging his truth such things are as “clouds” that veil the eyes of those whose inner being hath not tasted the salsabíl of detachment nor drunk from the kawthar of the knowledge of god such men when acquainted with those circumstances become so veiled that without the least question they pronounce the manifestation of god as infidel and sentence him to death you must have heard of such things taking place all down the ages and are now observing them in these days it behooveth us therefore to make the utmost endeavor that by god’s invisible assistance these dark veils these clouds of heaven sent trials may not hinder us from beholding the beauty of his shining countenance and that we may recognize him only by his own self xiv thedivine springtime is come most exalted pen for the festival of the all merciful is fast approaching bestir thyself and magnify before the entire creation the name of god and celebrate his praise in such wise that all created things may be regenerated and made new speak and hold not thy peace the daystar of blissfulness shineth above the horizon of our name the blissful inasmuch as the kingdom of the names of god hath been adorned with the ornament of the name of thy lord the creator of the heavens arise before the nations of the earth and arm thyself with the power of this most great name and be not of those who tarry methinks that thou hast halted and movest not upon my tablet could the brightness of the divine countenance have bewildered thee or the idle talk of the froward filled thee with grief and paralyzed thy movement take heed lest anything deter thee from extolling the greatness of this day—the day whereon the finger of majesty and power hath opened the seal of the wine of reunion and called all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth preferrest thou to tarry when the breeze announcing the day of god hath already breathed over thee or art thou of them that are shut out as by veil from him no veil whatever have allowed lord of all names and creator of the heavens to shut me from the recognition of the glories of thy day—the day which is the lamp of guidance unto the whole world and the sign of the ancient of days unto all them that dwell therein my silence is by reason of the veils that have blinded thy creatures’ eyes to thee and my muteness is because of the impediments that have hindered thy people from recognizing thy truth thou knowest what is in me but know not what is in thee thou art the all knowing the all informed by thy name that excelleth all other names if thy overruling and all compelling behest should ever reach me it would empower me to revive the souls of all men through thy most exalted word which have heard uttered by thy tongue of power in thy kingdom of glory it would enable me to announce the revelation of thy effulgent countenance wherethrough that which lay hidden from the eyes of men hath been manifested in thy name the perspicuous the sovereign protector the self subsisting canst thou discover anyone but me pen in this day what hath become of the creation and the manifestations thereof what of the names and their kingdom whither are gone all created things whether seen or unseen what of the hidden secrets of the universe and its revelations lo the entire creation hath passed away nothing remaineth except my face the ever abiding the resplendent the all glorious this is the day whereon naught can be seen except the splendors of the light that shineth from the face of thy lord the gracious the most bountiful verily we have caused every soul to expire by virtue of our irresistible and all subduing sovereignty we have then called into being new creation as token of our grace unto men am verily the all bountiful the ancient of days this is the day whereon the unseen world crieth out “great is thy blessedness earth for thou hast been made the footstool of thy god and been chosen as the seat of his mighty throne the realm of glory exclaimeth “would that my life could be sacrificed for thee for he who is the beloved of the all merciful hath established his sovereignty upon thee through the power of his name that hath been promised unto all things whether of the past or of the future this is the day whereon every sweet smelling thing hath derived its fragrance from the smell of my garment—a garment that hath shed its perfume upon the whole of creation this is the day whereon the rushing waters of everlasting life have gushed out of the will of the all merciful haste ye with your hearts and souls and quaff your fill concourse of the realms above say he it is who is the manifestation of him who is the unknowable the invisible of the invisibles could ye but perceive it he it is who hath laid bare before you the hidden and treasured gem were ye to seek it he it is who is the one beloved of all things whether of the past or of the future would that ye might set your hearts and hopes upon him we have heard the voice of thy pleading pen and excuse thy silence what is it that hath so sorely bewildered thee the inebriation of thy presence well beloved of all worlds hath seized and possessed me arise and proclaim unto the entire creation the tidings that he who is the all merciful hath directed his steps towards the riḍván and entered it guide then the people unto the garden of delight which god hath made the throne of his paradise we have chosen thee to be our most mighty trumpet whose blast is to signalize the resurrection of all mankind say this is the paradise on whose foliage the wine of utterance hath imprinted the testimony “he that was hidden from the eyes of men is revealed girded with sovereignty and power this is the paradise the rustling of whose leaves proclaimeth “o ye that inhabit the heavens and the earth there hath appeared what hath never previously appeared he who from everlasting had concealed his face from the sight of creation is now come from the whispering breeze that wafteth amidst its branches there cometh the cry “he who is the sovereign lord of all is made manifest the kingdom is god’s while from its streaming waters can be heard the murmur “all eyes are gladdened for he whom none hath beheld whose secret no one hath discovered hath lifted the veil of glory and uncovered the countenance of beauty within this paradise and from the heights of its loftiest chambers the maids of heaven have cried out and shouted “rejoice ye dwellers of the realms above for the fingers of him who is the ancient of days are ringing in the name of the all glorious the most great bell in the midmost heart of the heavens the hands of bounty have borne round the cup of everlasting life approach and quaff your fill drink with healthy relish ye that are the very incarnations of longing ye who are the embodiments of vehement desire this is the day whereon he who is the revealer of the names of god hath stepped out of the tabernacle of glory and proclaimed unto all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth “put away the cups of paradise and all the life giving waters they contain for lo the people of bahá have entered the blissful abode of the divine presence and quaffed the wine of reunion from the chalice of the beauty of their lord the all possessing the most high forget the world of creation pen and turn thou towards the face of thy lord the lord of all names adorn then the world with the ornament of the favors of thy lord the king of everlasting days for we perceive the fragrance of the day

luminaries of his most gracious favors—favors which none can reckon except him who is the omnipotent protector of the entire creation look not upon the creatures of god except with the eye of kindliness and of mercy for our loving providence hath pervaded all created things and our grace encompassed the earth and the heavens this is the day whereon the true servants of god partake of the life giving waters of reunion the day whereon those that are nigh unto him are able to drink of the soft flowing river of immortality and they who believe in his unity the wine of his presence through their recognition of him who is the highest and last end of all in whom the tongue of majesty and glory voiceth the call “the kingdom is mine myself am of mine own right its ruler attract the hearts of men through the call of him the one alone beloved say this is the voice of god if ye do but hearken this is the dayspring of the revelation of god did ye but know it this is the dawning place of the cause of god were ye to recognize it this is the source of the commandment of god did ye but judge it fairly this is the manifest and hidden secret would that ye might perceive it peoples of the world cast away in my name that transcendeth all other names the things ye possess and immerse yourselves in this ocean in whose depths lay hidden the pearls of wisdom and of utterance an ocean that

beloved draw near and tarry not though it be for one short moment blessed are they that have soared on the wings of detachment and attained the station which as ordained by god overshadoweth the entire creation whom neither the vain imaginations of the learned nor the multitude of the hosts of the earth have succeeded in deflecting from his cause who is there among you people who will renounce the world and draw nigh unto god the lord of all names where is he to be found who through the power of my name that transcendeth all created things will cast away the things that men possess and cling with all his might to the things which god the knower of the unseen and of the seen hath bidden him observe thus hath his bounty been sent down unto men his testimony fulfilled and his proof shone forth above the horizon of mercy rich is the prize that shall be won by him who hath believed and exclaimed “lauded art thou beloved of all worlds magnified be thy name thou the desire of every understanding heart rejoice with exceeding gladness people of bahá as ye call to remembrance the day of supreme felicity the day whereon the tongue of the ancient of days hath spoken as he departed from his house proceeding to the spot from which he shed upon the whole of creation the splendors of his name the all merciful god is our witness were we to reveal the hidden secrets of that day all they that dwell on earth and in the heavens would swoon away and die except such as will be preserved by god the almighty the all knowing the all wise such is the inebriating effect of the words of god upon him who is the revealer of his undoubted proofs that his pen can move no longer with these words he concludeth his tablet no god is there but me the most exalted the most powerful the most excellent the all knowing xv thepen of revelation exclaimeth “on this day the kingdom is god’s the tongue of power is calling “on this day all sovereignty is in very deed with god the phoenix of the realms above crieth out from the immortal branch “the glory of all greatness belongeth to god the incomparable the all compelling the mystic dove proclaimeth from its blissful bower in the everlasting

this day to none except god him who hath no peer nor equal who is the most powerful the all subduing the inmost essence of all things voiceth in all things the testimony “all forgiveness floweth in this day from god him to whom none can compare with whom no partners can be joined the sovereign protector of all men and the concealer of their sins the quintessence of glory hath lifted up its voice above my head and crieth from such heights as neither pen nor tongue can in any degree describe “god is my witness he the ancient of everlasting days is come girded with majesty and power there is none other god but him the all glorious the almighty the all highest the all wise the all pervading the all seeing the all informed the sovereign protector the source of eternal light my servant who hast sought the good pleasure of god and clung to his love on the day when all except few who were endued with insight have broken away from him may god through his grace recompense thee with generous an incorruptible and everlasting reward inasmuch as thou hast sought him on the day when eyes were blinded know thou that if we reveal to thee but sprinkling of the showers which through god’s decree and at the hands of the envious and the malicious have rained upon us thou wouldst weep with great weeping and wouldst bewail day and night our plight oh would that discerning and fair minded soul could be found who would recognize the wonders of this revelation—wonders that proclaim the sovereignty of god and the greatness of its power would that such man might arise and wholly for the sake of god admonish privately and openly the people that haply they may bestir themselves and aid this wronged one whom the workers of iniquity have so sorely afflicted methinks that hear the voice of the holy spirit calling from behind me saying vary thou thy theme and alter thy tone lest the heart of him who hath fixed his gaze upon thy face be saddened say have through the grace of god and his might besought the help of no one in the past neither will seek the help of anyone in the future he it is who aided me through the power of truth during the days of my banishment in ‘iráq he it is who overshadowed me with his protection at time when the kindreds of the earth were contending with me he it is who enabled me to depart out of the city clothed with such majesty as none except the denier and the malicious can fail to admit say my army is my reliance on god my people the force of my confidence in him my love is my standard and my companion the remembrance of god the sovereign lord of all the most powerful the all glorious the unconditioned arise wayfarer in the path of the love of god and aid thou his cause say barter not away this youth people for the vanities of this world or the delights of heaven by the righteousness of the one true god one hair of him excelleth all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth beware men lest ye be tempted to part with him in exchange for the gold and silver ye possess let his love be storehouse of treasure for your souls on the day when naught else but him shall profit you the day when every pillar shall tremble when the very skins of men shall creep when all eyes shall stare up with terror say people fear ye god and turn not away disdainfully from his revelation fall prostrate on your faces before god and celebrate his praise in the daytime and in the night season let thy soul glow with the flame of this undying fire that burneth in the midmost heart of the world in such wise that the waters of the universe shall be powerless to cool down its ardor make then mention of thy lord that haply the heedless among our servants may be admonished through thy words and the hearts of the righteous be gladdened xvi say men this is matchless day matchless must likewise be the tongue that celebrateth the praise of the desire of all nations and matchless the deed that aspireth to be acceptable in his sight the whole human race hath longed for this day that perchance it may fulfill that which well beseemeth its station and is worthy of its destiny blessed is the man whom the affairs of the world have failed to deter from recognizing him who is the lord of all things so blind hath become the human heart that neither the disruption of the city nor the reduction of the mountain in dust nor even the cleaving of the earth can shake off its torpor the allusions made in the scriptures have been unfolded and the signs recorded therein have been revealed and the prophetic cry is continually being raised and yet all except such as god was pleased to guide are bewildered in the drunkenness of their heedlessness witness how the world is being afflicted with fresh calamity every day its tribulation is continually deepening from the moment the súriy ra’ís tablet to ra’ís was revealed until the present day neither hath the world been tranquillized nor have the hearts of its peoples been at rest at one time it hath been agitated by contentions and disputes at another it hath been convulsed by wars and fallen victim to inveterate diseases its sickness is approaching the stage of utter hopelessness inasmuch as the true physician is debarred from administering the remedy whilst unskilled practitioners are regarded with favor and are accorded full freedom to act the dust of sedition hath clouded the hearts of men and blinded their eyes erelong they will perceive the consequences of what their hands have wrought in the day of god thus warneth you he who is the all informed as bidden by one who is the most powerful the almighty xvii byhim who is the great announcement the all merciful is come invested with undoubted sovereignty the balance hath been appointed and all them that dwell on earth have been gathered together the trumpet hath been blown and lo all eyes have stared up with terror and the hearts of all who are in the heavens and on the earth have trembled except them whom the breath of the verses of god hath quickened and who have detached themselves from all things this is the day whereon the earth shall tell out her tidings the workers of iniquity are her burdens could ye but perceive it the moon of idle fancy hath been cleft and the heaven hath given out palpable smoke we see the people laid low awed with the dread of thy lord the almighty the most powerful the crier hath cried out and men have been torn away so great hath been the fury of his wrath the people of the left hand sigh and bemoan the people of the right abide in noble habitations they quaff the wine that is life indeed from the hands of the all merciful and are verily the blissful the earth hath been shaken and the mountains have passed away and the angels have appeared rank on rank before us most of the people are bewildered in their drunkenness and wear on their faces the evidences of anger thus have we gathered together the workers of iniquity we see them rushing on towards their idol say none shall be secure this day from the decree of god this indeed is grievous day we point out to them those that led them astray they see them and yet recognize them not their eyes are drunken they are indeed blind people their proofs are the calumnies they uttered condemned are their calumnies by god the help in peril the self subsisting the evil one hath stirred up mischief in their hearts and they are afflicted with torment that none can avert they hasten to the wicked bearing the register of the workers of iniquity such are their doings say the heavens have been folded together and the earth is held within his grasp and the corrupt doers have been held by their forelock and still they understand not they drink of the tainted water and know it not say the shout hath been raised and the people have come forth from their graves and arising are gazing around them some have made haste to attain the court of the god of mercy others have fallen down on their faces in the fire of hell while still others are lost in bewilderment the verses of god have been revealed and yet they have turned away from them his proof hath been manifested and yet they are unaware of it and when they behold the face of the all merciful their own faces are saddened while they are disporting themselves they hasten forward to hell fire and mistake it for light far from god be what they fondly imagine say whether ye rejoice or whether ye burst for fury the heavens are cleft asunder and god hath come down invested with radiant sovereignty all created things are heard exclaiming “the kingdom is god’s the almighty the all knowing the all wise know thou moreover that we have been cast into an afflictive prison and are encompassed with the hosts of tyranny as result of what the hands of the infidels have wrought such is the gladness however which the youth hath tasted that no earthly joy can compare unto it by god the harm he suffereth at the hands of the oppressor can never grieve his heart nor can he be saddened by the ascendancy of such as have repudiated his truth say tribulation is horizon unto my revelation the daystar of grace shineth above it and sheddeth light which neither the clouds of men’s idle fancy nor the vain imaginations of the aggressor can obscure follow thou the footsteps of thy lord and remember his servants even as he doth remember thee undeterred by either the clamor of the heedless ones or the sword of the enemy spread abroad the sweet savors of thy lord and hesitate not though it be for less than moment in the service of his cause the day is approaching when the victory of thy lord the ever forgiving the most bountiful will be proclaimed xviii say we have caused the rivers of divine utterance to proceed out of our throne that the tender herbs of wisdom and understanding may spring forth from the soil of your hearts will ye not be thankful they who disdain to worship their lord shall be of those who are cast off and oft as our verses are rehearsed unto them they persist in proud disdain and in their gross violation of his law and know it not as for them who have disbelieved in him they shall be in the shadow of black smoke “the hour” hath come upon them while they are disporting themselves they have been seized by their forelock and yet know it not the thing that must come hath come suddenly behold how they flee from it the inevitable hath come to pass witness how they have cast it behind their backs this is the day whereon every man will fly from himself how much more from his kindred could ye but perceive it say by god the blast hath been blown on the trumpet and lo mankind hath swooned away before us the herald hath cried out and the summoner raised his voice saying “the kingdom is god’s the most powerful the help in peril the self subsisting this is the day on which all eyes shall stare up with terror the day in which the hearts of them that dwell on earth shall tremble save them whom thy lord the all knowing the all wise pleaseth to deliver all faces have turned black except those to whom the god of mercy hath vouchsafed radiant heart drunken are the eyes of those men that have openly refused to behold the face of god the all glorious the all praised say perused ye not the qur’án read it that haply ye may find the truth for this book is verily the straight path this is the way of god unto all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth if ye have been careless of the qur’án the bayán cannot be regarded to be remote from you behold it open before your eyes read ye its verses that perchance ye may desist from committing that which will cause the messengers of god to mourn and lament speed out of your sepulchers how long will ye sleep the second blast hath been blown on the trumpet on whom are ye gazing this is your lord the god of mercy witness how ye gainsay his signs the earth hath quaked with great quaking and cast forth her burdens will ye not admit it say will ye not recognize how the mountains have become like flocks of wool how the people are sore vexed at the awful majesty of the cause of god witness how their houses are empty ruins and they themselves drowned host this is the day whereon the all merciful hath come down in the clouds of knowledge clothed with manifest sovereignty he well knoweth the actions of men he it is whose glory none can mistake could ye but comprehend it the heaven of every religion hath been rent and the earth of human understanding been cleft asunder and the angels of god are seen descending say this is the day of mutual deceit whither do ye flee the mountains have passed away and the heavens have been folded together and the whole earth is held within his grasp could ye but understand it who is it that can protect you none by him who is the all merciful none except god the almighty the all glorious the beneficent every woman that hath had burden in her womb hath cast her burden we see men drunken in this day the day in which men and angels have been gathered together say is there any doubt concerning god behold how he hath come down from the heaven of his grace girded with power and invested with sovereignty is there any doubt concerning his signs open ye your eyes and consider his clear evidence paradise is on your right hand and hath been brought nigh unto you while hell hath been made to blaze witness its devouring flame haste ye to enter into paradise as token of our mercy unto you and drink ye from the hands of the all merciful the wine that is life indeed drink with healthy relish people of bahá ye are indeed they with whom it shall be well this is what they who have near access to god have attained this is the flowing water ye were promised in the qur’án and later in the bayán as recompense from your lord the god of mercy blessed are they that quaff it my servant that hath turned thy face towards me render thanks unto god for having sent down unto thee this tablet in this prison that thou mayest remind the people of the days of thy lord the all glorious the all knowing thus have we established for thee through the waters of our wisdom and utterance the foundations of thy belief this verily is the water whereon the throne of thy lord hath been raised “his throne had stood upon the waters ponder this in thine heart that thou mayest comprehend its meaning say praise be to god the lord of all worlds xix toevery discerning and illuminated heart it is evident that god the unknowable essence the divine being is immensely exalted beyond every human attribute such as corporeal existence ascent and descent egress and regress far be it from his glory that human tongue should adequately recount his praise or that human heart comprehend his fathomless mystery he is and hath ever been veiled in the ancient eternity of his essence and will remain in his reality everlastingly hidden from the sight of men “no vision taketh in him but he taketh in all vision he is the subtile the all perceiving ”… the door of the knowledge of the ancient of days being thus closed in the face of all beings the source of infinite grace according to his saying “his grace hath transcended all things my grace hath encompassed them all hath caused those luminous gems of holiness to appear out of the realm of the spirit in the noble form of the human temple and be made manifest unto all men that they may impart unto the world the mysteries of the unchangeable being and tell of the subtleties of his imperishable essence these sanctified mirrors these daysprings of ancient glory are one and all the exponents on earth of him who is the central orb of the universe its essence and ultimate purpose from him proceed their knowledge and power from him is derived their sovereignty the beauty of their countenance is but reflection of his image and their revelation sign of his deathless glory they are the treasuries of divine knowledge and the repositories of celestial wisdom through them is transmitted grace that is infinite and by them is revealed the light that can never fade these tabernacles of holiness these primal mirrors which reflect the light of unfading glory are but expressions of him who is the invisible of the invisibles by the revelation of these gems of divine virtue all the names and attributes of god such as knowledge and power sovereignty and dominion mercy and wisdom glory bounty and grace are made manifest these attributes of god are not and have never been vouchsafed specially unto certain prophets and withheld from others nay all the prophets of god his well favored his holy and chosen messengers are without exception the bearers of his names and the embodiments of his attributes they only differ in the intensity of their revelation and the comparative potency of their light even as he hath revealed “some of the apostles we have caused to excel the others it hath therefore become manifest and evident that within the tabernacles of these prophets and chosen ones of god the light of his infinite names and exalted attributes hath been reflected even though the light of some of these attributes may or may not be outwardly revealed from these luminous temples to the eyes of men that certain attribute of god hath not been outwardly manifested by these essences of detachment doth in no wise imply that they who are the daysprings of god’s attributes and the treasuries of his holy names did not actually possess it therefore these illuminated souls these beauteous countenances have each and every one of them been endowed with all the attributes of god such as sovereignty dominion and the like even though to outward seeming they be shorn of all earthly majesty xx knowthou of certainty that the unseen can in no wise incarnate his essence and reveal it unto men he is and hath ever been immensely exalted beyond all that can either be recounted or perceived from his retreat of glory his voice is ever proclaiming “verily am god there is none other god besides me the all knowing the all wise have manifested myself unto men and have sent down him who is the dayspring of the signs of my revelation through him have caused all creation to testify that there is none other god except him the incomparable the all informed the all wise he who is everlastingly hidden from the eyes of men can never be known except through his manifestation and his manifestation can adduce no greater proof of the truth of his mission than the proof of his own person xxi salmán the door of the knowledge of the ancient being hath ever been and will continue forever to be closed in the face of men no man’s understanding shall ever gain access unto his holy court as token of his mercy however and as proof of his loving kindness he hath manifested unto men the daystars of his divine guidance the symbols of his divine unity and hath ordained the knowledge of these sanctified beings to be identical with the knowledge of his own self whoso recognizeth them hath recognized god whoso hearkeneth to their call hath hearkened to the voice of god and whoso testifieth to the truth of their revelation hath testified to the truth of god himself whoso turneth away from them hath turned away from god and whoso disbelieveth in them hath disbelieved in god every one of them is the way of god that connecteth this world with the realms above and the standard of his truth unto every one in the kingdoms of earth and heaven they are the manifestations of god amidst men the evidences of his truth and the signs of his glory xxii thebearers of the trust of god are made manifest unto the peoples of the earth as the exponents of new cause and the revealers of new message inasmuch as these birds of the celestial throne are all sent down from the heaven of the will of god and as they all arise to proclaim his irresistible faith they therefore are regarded as one soul and the same person for they all drink from the one cup of the love of god and all partake of the fruit of the same tree of oneness these manifestations of god have each twofold station one is the station of pure abstraction and essential unity in this respect if thou callest them all by one name and dost ascribe to them the same attributes thou hast not erred from the truth even as he hath revealed “no distinction do we make between any of his messengers for they one and all summon the people of the earth to acknowledge the unity of god and herald unto them the kawthar of an infinite grace and bounty they are all invested with the robe of prophethood and are honored with the mantle of glory thus hath muḥammad the point of the qur’án revealed “i am all the prophets likewise he saith “i am the first adam noah moses and jesus similar statements have been made by imám ‘alí sayings such as these which indicate the essential unity of those exponents of oneness have also emanated from the channels of god’s immortal utterance and the treasuries of the gems of divine knowledge and have been recorded in the scriptures these countenances are the recipients of the divine command and the daysprings of his revelation this revelation is exalted above the veils of plurality and the exigencies of number thus he saith “our cause is but one inasmuch as the cause is one and the same the exponents thereof also must needs be one and the same likewise the imáms of the muḥammadan faith those lamps of certitude have said “muḥammad is our first muḥammad is our last muḥammad our all it is clear and evident to thee that all the prophets are the temples of the cause of god who have appeared clothed in divers attire if thou wilt observe with discriminating eyes thou wilt behold them all abiding in the same tabernacle soaring in the same heaven seated upon the same throne uttering the same speech and proclaiming the same faith such is the unity of those essences of being those luminaries of infinite and immeasurable splendor wherefore should one of these manifestations of holiness proclaim saying “i am the return of all the prophets he verily speaketh the truth in like manner in every subsequent revelation the return of the former revelation is fact the truth of which is firmly established the other station is the station of distinction and pertaineth to the world of creation and to the limitations thereof in this respect each manifestation of god hath distinct individuality definitely prescribed mission predestined revelation and specially designated limitations each one of them is known by different name is characterized by special attribute fulfills definite mission and is entrusted with particular revelation even as he saith “some of the apostles we have caused to excel the others to some god hath spoken some he hath raised and exalted and to jesus son of mary we gave manifest signs and we strengthened him with the holy spirit it is because of this difference in their station and mission that the words and utterances flowing from these wellsprings of divine knowledge appear to diverge and differ otherwise in the eyes of them that are initiated into the mysteries of divine wisdom all their utterances are in reality but the expressions of one truth as most of the people have failed to appreciate those stations to which we have referred they therefore feel perplexed and dismayed at the varying utterances pronounced by manifestations that are essentially one and the same it hath ever been evident that all these divergencies of utterance are attributable to differences of station thus viewed from the standpoint of their oneness and sublime detachment the attributes of godhead divinity supreme singleness and inmost essence have been and are applicable to those essences of being inasmuch as they all abide on the throne of divine revelation and are established upon the seat of divine concealment through their appearance the revelation of god is made manifest and by their countenance the beauty of god is revealed thus it is that the accents of god himself have been heard uttered by these manifestations of the divine being viewed in the light of their second station—the station of distinction differentiation temporal limitations characteristics and standards—they manifest absolute servitude utter destitution and complete self effacement even as he saith “i am the servant of god am but man like you ”… were any of the all embracing manifestations of god to declare “i am god he verily speaketh the truth and no doubt attacheth thereto for it hath been repeatedly demonstrated that through their revelation their attributes and names the revelation of god his names and his attributes are made manifest in the world thus he hath revealed “those shafts were god’s not thine and also he saith “in truth they who plighted fealty unto thee really plighted that fealty unto god and were any of them to voice the utterance “i am the messenger of god he also speaketh the truth the indubitable truth even as he saith “muḥammad is not the father of any man among you but he is the messenger of god viewed in this light they are all but messengers of that ideal king that unchangeable essence and were they all to proclaim “i am the seal of the prophets they verily utter but the truth beyond the faintest shadow of doubt for they are all but one person one soul one spirit one being one revelation they are all the manifestation of the “beginning” and the “end the “first” and the “last the “seen” and the “hidden”—all of which pertain to him who is the innermost spirit of spirits and eternal essence of essences and were they to say “we are the servants of god this also is manifest and indisputable fact for they have been made manifest in the uttermost state of servitude servitude the like of which no man can possibly attain thus in moments in which these essences of being were deep immersed beneath the oceans of ancient and everlasting holiness or when they soared to the loftiest summits of divine mysteries they claimed their utterances to be the voice of divinity the call of god himself were the eye of discernment to be opened it would recognize that in this very state they have considered themselves utterly effaced and nonexistent in the face of him who is the all pervading the incorruptible methinks they have regarded themselves as utter nothingness and deemed their mention in that court an act of blasphemy for the slightest whispering of self within such court is an evidence of self assertion and independent existence in the eyes of them that have attained unto that court such suggestion is itself grievous transgression how much more grievous would it be were aught else to be mentioned in that presence were man’s heart his tongue his mind or his soul to be busied with anyone but the well beloved were his eyes to behold any countenance other than his beauty were his ear to be inclined to any melody but his voice and were his feet to tread any way but his way by virtue of this station they have claimed for themselves the voice of divinity and the like whilst by virtue of their station of messengership they have declared themselves the messengers of god in every instance they have voiced an utterance that would conform to the requirements of the occasion and have ascribed all these declarations to themselves declarations ranging from the realm of divine revelation to the realm of creation and from the domain of divinity even unto the domain of earthly existence thus it is that whatsoever be their utterance whether it pertain to the realm of divinity lordship prophethood messengership guardianship apostleship or servitude all is true beyond the shadow of doubt therefore these sayings which we have quoted in support of our argument must be attentively considered that the divergent utterances of the manifestations of the unseen and daysprings of holiness may cease to agitate the soul and perplex the mind xxiii considerthe former generations witness how every time the daystar of divine bounty hath shed the light of his revelation upon the world the people of his day have arisen against him and repudiated his truth they who were regarded as the leaders of men have invariably striven to hinder their followers from turning unto him who is the ocean of god’s limitless bounty behold how the people as result of the verdict pronounced by the divines of his age have cast abraham the friend of god into fire how moses he who held converse with the almighty was denounced as liar and slanderer reflect how jesus the spirit of god was notwithstanding his extreme meekness and perfect tender heartedness treated by his enemies so fierce was the opposition which he the essence of being and lord of the visible and invisible had to face that he had nowhere to lay his head he wandered continually from place to place deprived of permanent abode ponder that which befell muḥammad the seal of the prophets may the life of all else be sacrifice unto him how severe the afflictions which the leaders of the jewish people and of the idol worshipers caused to rain upon him who is the sovereign lord of all in consequence of his proclamation of the unity of god and of the truth of his message by the righteousness of my cause my pen groaneth and all created things weep with great weeping as result of the woes he suffered at the hands of them that have broken the covenant of god violated his testament rejected his proofs and disputed his signs thus recount we unto thee the tale of that which happened in days past haply thou mayest comprehend thou hast known how grievously the prophets of god his messengers and chosen ones have been afflicted meditate awhile on the motive and reason which have been responsible for such persecution at no time in no dispensation have the prophets of god escaped the blasphemy of their enemies the cruelty of their oppressors the denunciation of the learned of their age who appeared in the guise of uprightness and piety day and night they passed through such agonies as none can ever measure except the knowledge of the one true god exalted be his glory consider this wronged one though the clearest proofs attest the truth of his cause though the prophecies he in an unmistakable language hath made have been fulfilled though in spite of his not being accounted among the learned his being unschooled and inexperienced in the disputations current among the divines he hath rained upon men the showers of his manifold and divinely inspired knowledge yet behold how this generation hath rejected his authority and rebelled against him he hath during the greater part of his life been sore tried in the clutches of his enemies his sufferings have now reached their culmination in this afflictive prison into which his oppressors have so unjustly thrown him god grant that with penetrating vision and radiant heart thou mayest observe the things that have come to pass and are now happening and pondering them in thine heart mayest recognize that which most men have in this day failed to perceive please god he may enable thee to inhale the sweet fragrance of his day to partake of the limitless effusions of his grace to quaff thy fill through his gracious favor from the most great ocean that surgeth in this day in the name of the ancient king and to remain firm and immovable as the mountain in his cause say glory be to thee who hast caused all the holy ones to confess their helplessness before the manifold revelations of thy might and every prophet to acknowledge his nothingness at the effulgence of thine abiding glory beseech thee by thy name that hath unlocked the gates of heaven and filled with ecstasy the concourse on high to enable me to serve thee in this day and to strengthen me to observe that which thou didst prescribe in thy book thou knowest my lord what is in me but know not what is in thee thou art the all knowing the all informed xxiv beware believers in the unity of god lest ye be tempted to make any distinction between any of the manifestations of his cause or to discriminate against the signs that have accompanied and proclaimed their revelation this indeed is the true meaning of divine unity if ye be of them that apprehend and believe this truth be ye assured moreover that the works and acts of each and every one of these manifestations of god nay whatever pertaineth unto them and whatsoever they may manifest in the future are all ordained by god and are reflection of his will and purpose whoso maketh the slightest possible difference between their persons their words their messages their acts and manners hath indeed disbelieved in god hath repudiated his signs and betrayed the cause of his messengers xxv itis evident that every age in which manifestation of god hath lived is divinely ordained and may in sense be characterized as god’s appointed day this day however is unique and is to be distinguished from those that have preceded it the designation “seal of the prophets” fully revealeth its high station the prophetic cycle hath verily ended the eternal truth is now come he hath lifted up the ensign of power and is now shedding upon the world the unclouded splendor of his revelation xxvi praisebe to god the all possessing the king of incomparable glory praise which is immeasurably above the understanding of all created things and is exalted beyond the grasp of the minds of men none else besides him hath ever been able to sing adequately his praise nor will any man succeed at any time in describing the full measure of his glory who is it that can claim to have attained the heights of his exalted essence and what mind can measure the depths of his unfathomable mystery from each and every revelation emanating from the source of his glory holy and never ending evidences of unimaginable splendor have appeared and out of every manifestation of his invincible power oceans of eternal light have poured how immensely exalted are the wondrous testimonies of his almighty sovereignty glimmer of which if it but touched them would utterly consume all that are in the heavens and in the earth how indescribably lofty are the tokens of his consummate power single sign of which however inconsiderable must transcend the comprehension of whatsoever hath from the beginning that hath no beginning been brought into being or will be created in the future till the end that hath no end all the embodiments of his names wander in the wilderness of search athirst and eager to discover his essence and all the manifestations of his attributes implore him from the sinai of holiness to unravel his mystery drop of the billowing ocean of his endless mercy hath adorned all creation with the ornament of existence and breath wafted from his peerless paradise hath invested all beings with the robe of his sanctity and glory sprinkling from the unfathomed deep of his sovereign and all pervasive will hath out of utter nothingness called into being creation which is infinite in its range and deathless in its duration the wonders of his bounty can never cease and the stream of his merciful grace can never be arrested the process of his creation hath had no beginning and can have no end in every age and cycle he hath through the splendorous light shed by the manifestations of his wondrous essence recreated all things so that whatsoever reflecteth in the heavens and on the earth the signs of his glory may not be deprived of the outpourings of his mercy nor despair of the showers of his favors how all encompassing are the wonders of his boundless grace behold how they have pervaded the whole of creation such is their virtue that not single atom in the entire universe can be found which doth not declare the evidences of his might which doth not glorify his holy name or is not expressive of the effulgent light of his unity so perfect and comprehensive is his creation that no mind nor heart however keen or pure can ever grasp the nature of the most insignificant of his creatures much less fathom the mystery of him who is the daystar of truth who is the invisible and unknowable essence the conceptions of the devoutest of mystics the attainments of the most accomplished amongst men the highest praise which human tongue or pen can render are all the product of man’s finite mind and are conditioned by its limitations ten thousand prophets each moses are thunderstruck upon the sinai of their search at his forbidding voice “thou shalt never behold me whilst myriad messengers each as great as jesus stand dismayed upon their heavenly thrones by the interdiction “mine essence thou shalt never apprehend from time immemorial he hath been veiled in the ineffable sanctity of his exalted self and will everlastingly continue to be wrapt in the impenetrable mystery of his unknowable essence every attempt to attain to an understanding of his inaccessible reality hath ended in complete bewilderment and every effort to approach his exalted self and envisage his essence hath resulted in hopelessness and failure how bewildering to me insignificant as am is the attempt to fathom the sacred depths of thy knowledge how futile my efforts to visualize the magnitude of the power inherent in thine handiwork—the revelation of thy creative power how can mine eye which hath no faculty to perceive itself claim to have discerned thine essence and how can mine heart already powerless to apprehend the significance of its own potentialities pretend to have comprehended thy nature how can claim to have known thee when the entire creation is bewildered by thy mystery and how can confess not to have known thee when lo the whole universe proclaimeth thy presence and testifieth to thy truth the portals of thy grace have throughout eternity been open and the means of access unto thy presence made available unto all created things and the revelations of thy matchless beauty have at all times been imprinted upon the realities of all beings visible and invisible yet notwithstanding this most gracious favor this perfect and consummate bestowal am moved to testify that thy court of holiness and glory is immeasurably exalted above the knowledge of all else besides thee and the mystery of thy presence is inscrutable to every mind except thine own no one except thyself can unravel the secret of thy nature and naught else but thy transcendental essence can grasp the reality of thy unsearchable being how vast the number of those heavenly and all glorious beings who in the wilderness of their separation from thee have wandered all the days of their lives and failed in the end to find thee how great the multitude of the sanctified and immortal souls who were lost and bewildered while seeking in the desert of search to behold thy face myriad are thine ardent lovers whom the consuming flame of remoteness from thee hath caused to sink and perish and numberless are the faithful souls who have willingly laid down their lives in the hope of gazing on the light of thy countenance the sighs and moans of these longing hearts that pant after thee can never reach thy holy court neither can the lamentations of the wayfarers that thirst to appear before thy face attain thy seat of glory xxvii allpraise to the unity of god and all honor to him the sovereign lord the incomparable and all glorious ruler of the universe who out of utter nothingness hath created the reality of all things who from naught hath brought into being the most refined and subtle elements of his creation and who rescuing his creatures from the abasement of remoteness and the perils of ultimate extinction hath received them into his kingdom of incorruptible glory nothing short of his all encompassing grace his all pervading mercy could have possibly achieved it how could it otherwise have been possible for sheer nothingness to have acquired by itself the worthiness and capacity to emerge from its state of nonexistence into the realm of being having created the world and all that liveth and moveth therein he through the direct operation of his unconstrained and sovereign will chose to confer upon man the unique distinction and capacity to know him and to love him—a capacity that must needs be regarded as the generating impulse and the primary purpose underlying the whole of creation upon the inmost reality of each and every created thing he hath shed the light of one of his names and made it recipient of the glory of one of his attributes upon the reality of man however he hath focused the radiance of all of his names and attributes and made it mirror of his own self alone of all created things man hath been singled out for so great favor so enduring bounty these energies with which the daystar of divine bounty and source of heavenly guidance hath endowed the reality of man lie however latent within him even as the flame is hidden within the candle and the rays of light are potentially present in the lamp the radiance of these energies may be obscured by worldly desires even as the light of the sun can be concealed beneath the dust and dross which cover the mirror neither the candle nor the lamp can be lighted through their own unaided efforts nor can it ever be possible for the mirror to free itself from its dross it is clear and evident that until fire is kindled the lamp will never be ignited and unless the dross is blotted out from the face of the mirror it can never represent the image of the sun nor reflect its light and glory and since there can be no tie of direct intercourse to bind the one true god with his creation and no resemblance whatever can exist between the transient and the eternal the contingent and the absolute he hath ordained that in every age and dispensation pure and stainless soul be made manifest in the kingdoms of earth and heaven unto this subtle this mysterious and ethereal being he hath assigned twofold nature the physical pertaining to the world of matter and the spiritual which is born of the substance of god himself he hath moreover conferred upon him double station the first station which is related to his innermost reality representeth him as one whose voice is the voice of god himself to this testifieth the tradition “manifold and mysterious is my relationship with god am he himself and he is myself except that am that am and he is that he is and in like manner the words “arise muḥammad for lo the lover and the beloved are joined together and made one in thee he similarly saith “there is no distinction whatsoever between thee and them except that they are thy servants the second station is the human station exemplified by the following verses “i am but man like you “say praise be to my lord am more than man an apostle these essences of detachment these resplendent realities are the channels of god’s all pervasive grace led by the light of unfailing guidance and invested with supreme sovereignty they are commissioned to use the inspiration of their words the effusions of their infallible grace and the sanctifying breeze of their revelation for the cleansing of every longing heart and receptive spirit from the dross and dust of earthly cares and limitations then and only then will the trust of god latent in the reality of man emerge as resplendent as the rising orb of divine revelation from behind the veil of concealment and implant the ensign of its revealed glory upon the summits of men’s hearts from the foregoing passages and allusions it hath been made indubitably clear that in the kingdoms of earth and heaven there must needs be manifested being an essence who shall act as manifestation and vehicle for the transmission of the grace of the divinity itself the sovereign lord of all through the teachings of this daystar of truth every man will advance and develop until he attaineth the station at which he can manifest all the potential forces with which his inmost true self hath been endowed it is for this very purpose that in every age and dispensation the prophets of god and his chosen ones have appeared amongst men and have evinced such power as is born of god and such might as only the eternal can reveal can one of sane mind ever seriously imagine that in view of certain words the meaning of which he cannot comprehend the portal of god’s infinite guidance can ever be closed in the face of men can he ever conceive for these divine luminaries these resplendent lights either beginning or an end what outpouring flood can compare with the stream of his all embracing grace and what blessing can excel the evidences of so great and pervasive mercy there can be no doubt whatever that if for one moment the tide of his mercy and grace were to be withheld from the world it would completely perish for this reason from the beginning that hath no beginning the portals of divine mercy have been flung open to the face of all created things and the clouds of truth will continue to the end that hath no end to rain on the soil of human capacity reality and personality their favors and bounties such hath been god’s method continued from everlasting to everlasting xxviii happyis the man who will arise to serve my cause and glorify my beauteous name take hold of my book with the power of my might and cleave tenaciously to whatsoever commandment thy lord the ordainer the all wise hath prescribed therein behold muḥammad how the sayings and doings of the followers ofshí‘ih islám have dulled the joy and fervor of its early days and tarnished the pristine brilliancy of its light in its primitive days whilst they still adhered to the precepts associated with the name of their prophet the lord of mankind their career was marked by an unbroken chain of victories and triumphs as they gradually strayed from the path of their ideal leader and master as they turned away from the light of god and corrupted the principle of his divine unity and as they increasingly centered their attention upon them who were only the revealers of the potency of his word their power was turned into weakness their glory into shame their courage into fear thou dost witness to what pass they have come behold how they have joined partners with him who is the focal point of divine unity behold how their evil doings have hindered them from recognizing in the day of resurrection the word of truth exalted be his glory we cherish the hope that this people will henceforth shield themselves from vain hopes and idle fancies and will attain to true understanding of the meaning of divine unity the person of the manifestation hath ever been the representative and mouthpiece of god he in truth is the dayspring of god’s most excellent titles and the dawning place of his exalted attributes if any be set up by his side as peers if they be regarded as identical with his person how can it then be maintained that the divine being is one and incomparable that his essence is indivisible and peerless meditate on that which we have through the power of truth revealed unto thee and be thou of them that comprehend its meaning xxix thepurpose of god in creating man hath been and will ever be to enable him to know his creator and to attain his presence to this most excellent aim this supreme objective all the heavenly books and the divinely revealed and weighty scriptures unequivocally bear witness whoso hath recognized the dayspring of divine guidance and entered his holy court hath drawn nigh unto god and attained his presence presence which is the real paradise and of which the loftiest mansions of heaven are but symbol such man hath attained the knowledge of the station of him who is “at the distance of two bows who standeth beyond the sadratu’l muntahá whoso hath failed to recognize him will have condemned himself to the misery of remoteness remoteness which is naught but utter nothingness and the essence of the nethermost fire such will be his fate though to outward seeming he may occupy the earth’s loftiest seats and be established upon its most exalted throne he who is the dayspring of truth is no doubt fully capable of rescuing from such remoteness wayward souls and of causing them to draw nigh unto his court and attain his presence “if god had pleased he had surely made all men one people his purpose however is to enable the pure in spirit and the detached in heart to ascend by virtue of their own innate powers unto the shores of the most great ocean that thereby they who seek the beauty of the all glorious may be distinguished and separated from the wayward and perverse thus hath it been ordained by the all glorious and resplendent pen that the manifestations of divine justice the daysprings of heavenly grace have when they appeared amongst men always been destitute of all earthly dominion and shorn of the means of worldly ascendancy should be attributed to this same principle of separation and distinction which animateth the divine purpose were the eternal essence to manifest all that is latent within him were he to shine in the plentitude of his glory none would be found to question his power or repudiate his truth nay all created things would be so dazzled and thunderstruck by the evidences of his light as to be reduced to utter nothingness how then can the godly be differentiated under such circumstances from the froward this principle hath operated in each of the previous dispensations and been abundantly demonstrated it is for this reason that in every age when new manifestation hath appeared and fresh revelation of god’s transcendent power was vouchsafed unto men they that misbelieved in him deluded by the appearance of the peerless and everlasting beauty in the garb of mortal men have failed to recognize him they have erred from his path and eschewed his company—the company of him who is the symbol of nearness to god they have even arisen to decimate the ranks of the faithful and to exterminate such as believed in him behold how in this dispensation the worthless and foolish have fondly imagined that by such instruments as massacre plunder and banishment they can extinguish the lamp which the hand of divine power hath lit or eclipse the daystar of everlasting splendor how utterly unaware they seem to be of the truth that such adversity is the oil that feedeth the flame of this lamp such is god’s transforming power he changeth whatsoever he willeth he verily hath power over all things consider at all times the sovereignty exercised by the ideal king and behold the evidences of his power and paramount influence sanctify your ears from the idle talk of them that are the symbols of denial and the exponents of violence and anger the hour is approaching when ye will witness the power of the one true god triumphing over all created things and the signs of his sovereignty encompassing all creation on that day ye will discover how all else besides him will have been forgotten and come to be regarded as utter nothingness it should however be borne in mind that god and his manifestation can under no circumstances be dissociated from the loftiness and sublimity which they inherently possess nay loftiness and sublimity are themselves the creations of his word if ye choose to see with my sight not with yours xxx godwitnesseth that there is no god but him the gracious the best beloved all grace and bounty are his to whomsoever he will he giveth whatsoever is his wish he verily is the all powerful the almighty the help in peril the self subsisting we verily believe in him who in the person of the báb hath been sent down by the will of the one true god the king of kings the all praised we moreover swear fealty to the one who in the time of mustagháth is destined to be made manifest as well as to those who shall come after him till the end that hath no end we recognize in the manifestation of each one of them whether outwardly or inwardly the manifestation of none but god himself if ye be of those that comprehend every one of them is mirror of god reflecting naught else but his self his beauty his might and glory if ye will understand all else besides them are to be regarded as mirrors capable of reflecting the glory of these manifestations who are themselves the primary mirrors of the divine being if ye be not devoid of understanding no one hath ever escaped them neither are they to be hindered from achieving their purpose these mirrors will everlastingly succeed each other and will continue to reflect the light of the ancient of days they that reflect their glory will in like manner continue to exist forevermore for the grace of god can never cease from flowing this is truth that none can disprove xxxi contemplatewith thine inward eye the chain of successive revelations that hath linked the manifestation of adam with that of the báb testify before god that each one of these manifestations hath been sent down through the operation of the divine will and purpose that each hath been the bearer of specific message that each hath been entrusted with divinely revealed book and been commissioned to unravel the mysteries of mighty tablet the measure of the revelation with which every one of them hath been identified had been definitely foreordained this verily is token of our favor unto them if ye be of those that comprehend this truth and when this process of progressive revelation culminated in the stage at which his peerless his most sacred and exalted countenance was to be unveiled to men’s eyes he chose to hide his own self behind thousand veils lest profane and mortal eyes discover his glory this he did at time when the signs and tokens of divinely appointed revelation were being showered upon him—signs and tokens which none can reckon except the lord your god the lord of all worlds and when the set time of concealment was fulfilled we sent forth whilst still wrapt within myriad veils an infinitesimal glimmer of the effulgent glory enveloping the face of the youth and lo the entire company of the dwellers of the realms above were seized with violent commotion and the favored of god fell down in adoration before him he hath verily manifested glory such as none in the whole creation hath witnessed inasmuch as he hath arisen to proclaim in person his cause unto all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth xxxii thatwhich thou hast heard concerning abraham the friend of the all merciful is the truth and no doubt is there about it the voice of god commanded him to offer up ishmael as sacrifice so that his steadfastness in the faith of god and his detachment from all else but him may be demonstrated unto men the purpose of god moreover was to sacrifice him as ransom for the sins and iniquities of all the peoples of the earth this same honor jesus the son of mary besought the one true god exalted be his name and glory to confer upon him for the same reason was ḥusayn offered up as sacrifice by muḥammad the apostle of god no man can ever claim to have comprehended the nature of the hidden and manifold grace of god none can fathom his all embracing mercy such hath been the perversity of men and their transgressions so grievous have been the trials that have afflicted the prophets of god and their chosen ones that all mankind deserveth to be tormented and to perish god’s hidden and most loving providence however hath through both visible and invisible agencies protected and will continue to protect it from the penalty of its wickedness ponder this in thine heart that the truth may be revealed unto thee and be thou steadfast in his path xxxiii ithath been decreed by us that the word of god and all the potentialities thereof shall be manifested unto men in strict conformity with such conditions as have been foreordained by him who is the all knowing the all wise we have moreover ordained that its veil of concealment be none other except its own self such indeed is our power to achieve our purpose should the word be allowed to release suddenly all the energies latent within it no man could sustain the weight of so mighty revelation nay all that is in heaven and on earth would flee in consternation before it consider that which hath been sent down unto muḥammad the apostle of god the measure of the revelation of which he was the bearer had been clearly foreordained by him who is the almighty the all powerful they that heard him however could apprehend his purpose only to the extent of their station and spiritual capacity he in like manner uncovered the face of wisdom in proportion to their ability to sustain the burden of his message no sooner had mankind attained the stage of maturity than the word revealed to men’s eyes the latent energies with which it had been endowed—energies which manifested themselves in the plenitude of their glory when the ancient beauty appeared in the year sixty in the person of ‘alí muḥammad the báb xxxiv allpraise and glory be to god who through the power of his might hath delivered his creation from the nakedness of nonexistence and clothed it with the mantle of life from among all created things he hath singled out for his special favor the pure the gem like reality of man and invested it with unique capacity of knowing him and of reflecting the greatness of his glory this twofold distinction conferred upon him hath cleansed away from his heart the rust of every vain desire and made him worthy of the vesture with which his creator hath deigned to clothe him it hath served to rescue his soul from the wretchedness of ignorance this robe with which the body and soul of man hath been adorned is the very foundation of his well being and development oh how blessed the day when aided by the grace and might of the one true god man will have freed himself from the bondage and corruption of the world and all that is therein and will have attained unto true and abiding rest beneath the shadow of the tree of knowledge the songs which the bird of thine heart had uttered in its great love for its friends have reached their ears and moved me to answer thy questions and reveal to thee such secrets as am allowed to unfold in thine esteemed letter thou hadst inquired which of the prophets of god should be regarded as superior to others know thou assuredly that the essence of all the prophets of god is one and the same their unity is absolute god the creator saith there is no distinction whatsoever among the bearers of my message they all have but one purpose their secret is the same secret to prefer one in honor to another to exalt certain ones above the rest is in no wise to be permitted every true prophet hath regarded his message as fundamentally the same as the revelation of every other prophet gone before him if any man therefore should fail to comprehend this truth and should consequently indulge in vain and unseemly language no one whose sight is keen and whose understanding is enlightened would ever allow such idle talk to cause him to waver in his belief the measure of the revelation of the prophets of god in this world however must differ each and every one of them hath been the bearer of distinct message and hath been commissioned to reveal himself through specific acts it is for this reason that they appear to vary in their greatness their revelation may be likened unto the light of the moon that sheddeth its radiance upon the earth though every time it appeareth it revealeth fresh measure of its brightness yet its inherent splendor can never diminish nor can its light suffer extinction it is clear and evident therefore that any apparent variation in the intensity of their light is not inherent in the light itself but should rather be attributed to the varying receptivity of an ever changing world every prophet whom the almighty and peerless creator hath purposed to send to the peoples of the earth hath been entrusted with message and charged to act in manner that would best meet the requirements of the age in which he appeared god’s purpose in sending his prophets unto men is twofold the first is to liberate the children of men from the darkness of ignorance and guide them to the light of true understanding the second is to ensure the peace and tranquillity of mankind and provide all the means by which they can be established the prophets of god should be regarded as physicians whose task is to foster the well being of the world and its peoples that through the spirit of oneness they may heal the sickness of divided humanity to none is given the right to question their words or disparage their conduct for they are the only ones who can claim to have understood the patient and to have correctly diagnosed its ailments no man however acute his perception can ever hope to reach the heights which the wisdom and understanding of the divine physician have attained little wonder then if the treatment prescribed by the physician in this day should not be found to be identical with that which he prescribed before how could it be otherwise when the ills affecting the sufferer necessitate at every stage of his sickness special remedy in like manner every time the prophets of god have illumined the world with the resplendent radiance of the daystar of divine knowledge they have invariably summoned its peoples to embrace the light of god through such means as best befitted the exigencies of the age in which they appeared they were thus able to scatter the darkness of ignorance and to shed upon the world the glory of their own knowledge it is towards the inmost essence of these prophets therefore that the eye of every man of discernment must be directed inasmuch as their one and only purpose hath always been to guide the erring and give peace to the afflicted these are not days of prosperity and triumph the whole of mankind is in the grip of manifold ills strive therefore to save its life through the wholesome medicine which the almighty hand of the unerring physician hath prepared and now concerning thy question regarding the nature of religion know thou that they who are truly wise have likened the world unto the human temple as the body of man needeth garment to clothe it so the body of mankind must needs be adorned with the mantle of justice and wisdom its robe is the revelation vouchsafed unto it by god whenever this robe hath fulfilled its purpose the almighty will assuredly renew it for every age requireth fresh measure of the light of god every divine revelation hath been sent down in manner that befitted the circumstances of the age in which it hath appeared as to thy question regarding the sayings of the leaders of past religions every wise and praiseworthy man will no doubt eschew such vain and profitless talk the incomparable creator hath created all men from one same substance and hath exalted their reality above the rest of his creatures success or failure gain or loss must therefore depend upon man’s own exertions the more he striveth the greater will be his progress we fain would hope that the vernal showers of the bounty of god may cause the flowers of true understanding to spring from the soil of men’s hearts and may wash them from all earthly defilements xxxv ponderawhile what is it that prompted in every dispensation the peoples of the earth to shun the manifestation of the all merciful what could have impelled them to turn away from him and to challenge his authority were men to meditate on these words which have flowed from the pen of the divine ordainer they would one and all hasten to embrace the truth of this god given and ever enduring revelation and would testify to that which he himself hath solemnly affirmed it is the veil of idle imaginations which in the days of the manifestations of the unity of god and the daysprings of his everlasting glory hath intervened and will continue to intervene between them and the rest of mankind for in those days he who is the eternal truth manifesteth himself in conformity with that which he himself hath purposed and not according to the desires and expectations of men even as he hath revealed “so oft then as an apostle cometh to you with that which your souls desire not do ye swell with pride and treat some as impostors and slay others there can be no doubt whatever that had these apostles appeared in bygone ages and cycles in accordance with the vain imaginations which the hearts of men had devised no one would have repudiated the truth of these sanctified beings though such men have been night and day remembering the one true god and have been devoutly engaged in the exercise of their devotions yet they failed in the end to recognize and partake of the grace of the daysprings of the signs of god and the manifestations of his irrefutable evidences to this the scriptures bear witness thou hast no doubt heard about it consider the dispensation of jesus christ behold how all the learned men of that generation though eagerly anticipating the coming of the promised one have nevertheless denied him both annas the most learned among the divines of his day and caiaphas the high priest denounced him and pronounced the sentence of his death in like manner when muḥammad the prophet of god—may all men be sacrifice unto him—appeared the learned men of mecca and medina arose in the early days of his revelation against him and rejected his message while they who were destitute of all learning recognized and embraced his faith ponder awhile consider how balál the ethiopian unlettered though he was ascended into the heaven of faith and certitude whilst ‘abdu’lláh ubayy leader among the learned maliciously strove to oppose him behold how mere shepherd was so carried away by the ecstasy of the words of god that he was able to gain admittance into the habitation of his best beloved and was united to him who is the lord of mankind whilst they who prided themselves on their knowledge and wisdom strayed far from his path and remained deprived of his grace for this reason he hath written “he that is exalted among you shall be abased and he that is abased shall be exalted references to this theme are to be found in most of the heavenly books as well as in the sayings of the prophets and messengers of god verily say such is the greatness of this cause that the father flieth from his son and the son flieth from his father call ye to mind the story of noah and canaan god grant that in these days of heavenly delight ye may not deprive yourselves of the sweet savors of the all glorious god and may partake in this spiritual springtime of the outpourings of his grace arise in the name of him who is the object of all knowledge and with absolute detachment from the learning of men lift up your voices and proclaim his cause swear by the daystar of divine revelation the very moment ye arise ye will witness how flood of divine knowledge will gush out of your hearts and will behold the wonders of his heavenly wisdom manifested in all their glory before you were ye to taste of the sweetness of the sayings of the all merciful ye would unhesitatingly forsake your selves and would lay down your lives for the well beloved who can ever believe that this servant of god hath at any time cherished in his heart desire for any earthly honor or benefit the cause associated with his name is far above the transitory things of this world behold him an exile victim of tyranny in this most great prison his enemies have assailed him on every side and will continue to do so till the end of his life whatever therefore he saith unto you is wholly for the sake of god that haply the peoples of the earth may cleanse their hearts from the stain of evil desire may rend its veil asunder and attain unto the knowledge of the one true god—the most exalted station to which any man can aspire their belief or disbelief in my cause can neither profit nor harm me we summon them wholly for the sake of god he verily can afford to dispense with all creatures xxxvi knowthou that when the son of man yielded up his breath to god the whole creation wept with great weeping by sacrificing himself however fresh capacity was infused into all created things its evidences as witnessed in all the peoples of the earth are now manifest before thee the deepest wisdom which the sages have uttered the profoundest learning which any mind hath unfolded the arts which the ablest hands have produced the influence exerted by the most potent of rulers are but manifestations of the quickening power released by his transcendent his all pervasive and resplendent spirit we testify that when he came into the world he shed the splendor of his glory upon all created things through him the leper recovered from the leprosy of perversity and ignorance through him the unchaste and wayward were healed through his power born of almighty god the eyes of the blind were opened and the soul of the sinner sanctified leprosy may be interpreted as any veil that interveneth between man and the recognition of the lord his god whoso alloweth himself to be shut out from him is indeed leper who shall not be remembered in the kingdom of god the mighty the all praised we bear witness that through the power of the word of god every leper was cleansed every sickness was healed every human infirmity was banished he it is who purified the world blessed is the man who with face beaming with light hath turned towards him xxxvii blessedis the man that hath acknowledged his belief in god and in his signs and recognized that “he shall not be asked of his doings such recognition hath been made by god the ornament of every belief and its very foundation upon it must depend the acceptance of every goodly deed fasten your eyes upon it that haply the whisperings of the rebellious may not cause you to slip were he to decree as lawful the thing which from time immemorial had been forbidden and forbid that which had at all times been regarded as lawful to none is given the right to question his authority whoso will hesitate though it be for less than moment should be regarded as transgressor whoso hath not recognized this sublime and fundamental verity and hath failed to attain this most exalted station the winds of doubt will agitate him and the sayings of the infidels will distract his soul he that hath acknowledged this principle will be endowed with the most perfect constancy all honor to this all glorious station the remembrance of which adorneth every exalted tablet such is the teaching which god bestoweth on you teaching that will deliver you from all manner of doubt and perplexity and enable you to attain unto salvation in both this world and the next he verily is the ever forgiving the most bountiful xxxviii knowof certainty that in every dispensation the light of divine revelation hath been vouchsafed unto men in direct proportion to their spiritual capacity consider the sun how feeble its rays the moment it appeareth above the horizon how gradually its warmth and potency increase as it approacheth its zenith enabling meanwhile all created things to adapt themselves to the growing intensity of its light how steadily it declineth until it reacheth its setting point were it all of sudden to manifest the energies latent within it it would no doubt cause injury to all created things in like manner if the sun of truth were suddenly to reveal at the earliest stages of its manifestation the full measure of the potencies which the providence of the almighty hath bestowed upon it the earth of human understanding would waste away and be consumed for men’s hearts would neither sustain the intensity of its revelation nor be able to mirror forth the radiance of its light dismayed and overpowered they would cease to exist xxxix praisebe to thee lord my god for the wondrous revelations of thy inscrutable decree and the manifold woes and trials thou hast destined for myself at one time thou didst deliver me into the hands of nimrod at another thou hast allowed pharaoh’s rod to persecute me thou alone canst estimate through thine all encompassing knowledge and the operation of thy will the incalculable afflictions have suffered at their hands again thou didst cast me into the prison cell of the ungodly for no reason except that was moved to whisper into the ears of the well favored denizens of thy kingdom an intimation of the vision with which thou hadst through thy knowledge inspired me and revealed to me its meaning through the potency of thy might and again thou didst decree that be beheaded by the sword of the infidel again was crucified for having unveiled to men’s eyes the hidden gems of thy glorious unity for having revealed to them the wondrous signs of thy sovereign and everlasting power how bitter the humiliations heaped upon me in subsequent age on the plain of karbilá how lonely did feel amidst thy people to what state of helplessness was reduced in that land unsatisfied with such indignities my persecutors decapitated me and carrying aloft my head from land to land paraded it before the gaze of the unbelieving multitude and deposited it on the seats of the perverse and faithless in later age was suspended and my breast was made target to the darts of the malicious cruelty of my foes my limbs were riddled with bullets and my body was torn asunder finally behold how in this day my treacherous enemies have leagued themselves against me and are continually plotting to instill the venom of hate and malice into the souls of thy servants with all their might they are scheming to accomplish their purpose grievous as is my plight god my well beloved render thanks unto thee and my spirit is grateful for whatsoever hath befallen me in the path of thy good pleasure am well pleased with that which thou didst ordain for me and welcome however calamitous the pains and sorrows am made to suffer xl mywell beloved thou hast breathed thy breath into me and divorced me from mine own self thou didst subsequently decree that no more than faint reflection mere emblem of thy reality within me be left among the perverse and envious behold how deluded by this emblem they have risen against me and heaped upon me their denials uncover thy self therefore my best beloved and deliver me from my plight thereupon voice replied “i love dearly cherish this emblem how can consent that mine eyes alone gaze upon this emblem and that no heart except mine heart recognize it by my beauty which is the same as thy beauty my wish is to hide thee from mine own eyes how much more from the eyes of men was preparing to make reply when lo the tablet was suddenly ended leaving my theme unfinished and the pearl of mine utterance unstrung xli godis my witness people was asleep on my couch when lo the breeze of god wafting over me roused me from my slumber his quickening spirit revived me and my tongue was unloosed to voice his call accuse me not of having transgressed against god behold me not with your eyes but with mine thus admonisheth you he who is the gracious the all knowing think ye people that hold within my grasp the control of god’s ultimate will and purpose far be it from me to advance such claim to this testify before god the almighty the exalted the all knowing the all wise had the ultimate destiny of god’s faith been in mine hands would have never consented even though for one moment to manifest myself unto you nor would have allowed one word to fall from my lips of this god himself is verily witness xlii sonof justice in the night season the beauty of the immortal being hath repaired from the emerald height of fidelity unto the sadratu’l muntahá and wept with such weeping that the concourse on high and the dwellers of the realms above wailed at his lamenting whereupon there was asked why the wailing and weeping he made reply as bidden waited expectant upon the hill of faithfulness yet inhaled not from them that dwell on earth the fragrance of fidelity then summoned to return beheld and lo certain doves of holiness were sore tried within the claws of the dogs of earth thereupon the maid of heaven hastened forth unveiled and resplendent from her mystic mansion and asked of their names and all were told but one and when urged the first letter thereof was uttered whereupon the dwellers of the celestial chambers rushed forth out of their habitation of glory and whilst the second letter was pronounced they fell down one and all upon the dust at that moment voice was heard from the inmost shrine “thus far and no farther verily we bear witness unto that which they have done and now are doing xliii afnán thou that hast branched from mine ancient stock my glory and my loving kindness rest upon thee how vast is the tabernacle of the cause of god it hath overshadowed all the peoples and kindreds of the earth and will erelong gather together the whole of mankind beneath its shelter thy day of service is now come

attain unto true liberty justice is in this day bewailing its plight and equity groaneth beneath the yoke of oppression the thick clouds of tyranny have darkened the face of the earth and enveloped its peoples through the movement of our pen of glory we have at the bidding of the omnipotent ordainer breathed new life into every human frame and instilled into every word fresh potency all created

who is it that can dismay you touch of moisture sufficeth to dissolve the hardened clay out of which this perverse generation is molded the mere act of your gathering together is enough to scatter the forces of these vain and worthless people every man of insight will in this day readily admit that the counsels which the pen of this wronged one hath revealed constitute the supreme animating power for the advancement of the world and the exaltation of its peoples arise people and by the power of god’s might resolve to gain the victory over your own selves that haply the whole earth may be freed and sanctified from its servitude to the gods of its idle fancies—gods that have inflicted such loss upon and are responsible for the misery of their wretched worshipers these idols form the obstacle that impedeth man in his efforts to advance in the path of perfection we cherish the hope that the hand of divine power may lend its assistance to mankind and deliver it from its state of grievous abasement in one of the tablets these words have been revealed people of god do not busy yourselves in your own concerns let your thoughts be fixed upon that which will rehabilitate the fortunes of mankind and sanctify the hearts and souls of men this can best be achieved through pure and holy deeds through virtuous life and goodly behavior valiant acts will ensure the triumph of this cause and

hindereth the rise and obstructeth the spiritual progress of the children of men it is incumbent upon every man in this day to hold fast unto whatsoever will promote the interests and exalt the station of all nations and just governments through each and every one of the verses which the pen of the most high hath revealed the doors of love and unity have been unlocked and flung open to the face of men we have erewhile declared—and our word is the truth— “consort with the followers of all religions in spirit of friendliness and fellowship whatsoever hath led the children of men to shun one another and hath caused dissensions and divisions amongst them hath through the revelation of these words been nullified and abolished from the heaven of god’s will and for the purpose of ennobling the world of being and of elevating the minds and souls of men hath been sent down that which is the most effective instrument for the education of the whole human race the highest essence and most perfect expression of whatsoever the peoples of old have either said or written hath through this most potent revelation been sent down from the heaven of the will of the all possessing the ever abiding god of old it hath been revealed “love of one’s country is an element of the faith of god the tongue of grandeur hath however in the day of his manifestation proclaimed “it is not his to boast who loveth his country but it is his who loveth the world through the power released by these exalted words he hath lent fresh impulse and set new direction to the birds of men’s hearts and hath obliterated every trace of restriction and limitation from god’s holy book people of justice be as brilliant as the light and as splendid as the fire that blazed in the burning bush the brightness of the fire of your love will no doubt fuse and unify the contending peoples and kindreds of the earth whilst the fierceness of the flame of enmity and hatred cannot but result in strife and ruin we beseech god that he may shield his creatures from the evil designs of his enemies he verily hath power over all things all praise be to the one true god—exalted be his glory—inasmuch as he hath through the pen of the most high unlocked the doors of men’s hearts every verse which this pen hath revealed is bright and shining portal that discloseth the glories of saintly and pious life of pure and stainless deeds the summons and the message which we gave were never intended to reach or to benefit one land or one people only mankind in its entirety must firmly adhere to whatsoever hath been revealed and vouchsafed unto it then and only then will it attain unto true liberty the whole earth is illuminated with the resplendent glory of god’s revelation in the year sixty he who heralded the light of divine guidance—may all creation be sacrifice unto him—arose to announce fresh revelation of the divine spirit and was followed twenty years later by him through whose coming the world was made the recipient of this promised glory this wondrous favor behold how the generality of mankind hath been endued with the capacity to hearken unto god’s most exalted word—the word upon which must depend the gathering together and spiritual resurrection of all men incline your hearts people of god unto the counsels of your true your incomparable friend the word of god may be likened unto sapling whose roots have been implanted in the hearts of men it is incumbent upon you to foster its growth through the living waters of wisdom of sanctified and holy words so that its root may become firmly fixed and its branches may spread out as high as the heavens and beyond ye that dwell on earth the distinguishing feature that marketh the preeminent character of this supreme revelation consisteth in that we have on the one hand blotted out from the pages of god’s holy book whatsoever hath been the cause of strife of malice and mischief amongst the children of men and have on the other laid down the essential prerequisites of concord of understanding of complete and enduring unity well is it with them that keep my statutes time and again have we admonished our beloved ones to avoid nay to flee from anything whatsoever from which the odor of mischief can be detected the world is in great turmoil and the minds of its people are in state of utter confusion we entreat the

studied your writings nor participated in any of your disputations the garb he weareth his flowing locks his headdress attest the truth of his words how long will ye persist in your injustice witness the habitation in which he who is the incarnation of justice hath been forced to dwell open your eyes and beholding his plight meditate diligently upon that which your hands have wrought that haply ye may not be deprived of the light of his divine utterance nor remain bereft of your share of the ocean of his knowledge certain ones among both commoners and nobles have objected that this wronged one is neither member of the ecclesiastical order nor descendant of the prophet say ye that claim to be just reflect little while and ye shall recognize how infinitely exalted is his present state above the station ye claim he should possess the will of the almighty hath decreed that out of house wholly devoid of all that the divines the doctors the sages and scholars commonly possess his cause should proceed and be made manifest the breathings of the divine spirit awoke him and bade him arise and proclaim his revelation no sooner was he roused from his slumber than he lifted up his voice and summoned the whole of mankind unto god the lord of all worlds we have been moved to reveal these words in consideration of the weakness and frailty of men otherwise the cause we have proclaimed is such as no pen can ever describe nor any mind conceive its greatness to this beareth witness he with whom is the mother book xlv theancient beauty hath consented to be bound with chains that mankind may be released from its bondage and hath accepted to be made prisoner within this most mighty stronghold that the whole world may attain unto true liberty he hath drained to its dregs the cup of sorrow that all the peoples of the earth may attain unto abiding joy and be filled with gladness this is of the mercy of your lord the compassionate the most merciful we have accepted to be abased

words be fair in your judgment ye ministers of state what is it that we have committed that could justify our banishment what is the offense that hath warranted our expulsion it is we who have sought you and yet behold how ye refused to receive us by god this is sore injustice that ye have perpetrated—an injustice with which no earthly injustice can measure to this the almighty is himself witness

did return know ye that am afraid of none except god in none but him have placed my trust to none will cleave but him and wish for naught except the thing he hath wished for me this indeed is my heart’s desire did ye but know it have offered up my soul and my body as sacrifice for god the lord of all worlds whoso hath known god shall know none but him and he that feareth god shall be afraid of no one except him though the powers of the whole earth rise up and be arrayed against him speak naught except at his bidding and follow naught through the power of god and his might except his truth he verily shall recompense the truthful narrate servant the things thou didst behold at the time of thine arrival in the city that thy testimony may endure amongst men and serve as warning unto them that believe we found upon our arrival in the city its governors and elders as children gathered about and disporting themselves with clay we perceived no one sufficiently mature to acquire from us the truths which god hath taught us nor ripe for our wondrous words of wisdom our inner eye wept sore over them and over their transgressions and their total disregard of the thing for which they were created this is what we observed in that city and which we have chosen to note down in our book that it may serve as warning unto them and unto the rest of mankind say if ye be seekers after this life and the vanities thereof ye should have sought them while ye were still enclosed in your mothers’ wombs for at that time ye were continually approaching them could ye but perceive it ye have on the other hand ever since ye were born and attained maturity been all the while receding from the world and drawing closer to dust why then exhibit such greed in amassing the treasures of the earth when your days are numbered and your chance is well nigh lost will ye not then heedless ones shake off your slumber incline your ears to the counsels which this servant giveth you for the sake of god he verily asketh no recompense from you and is resigned to what god hath ordained for him and is entirely submissive to god’s will the days of your life are far spent people and your end is fast approaching put away therefore the things ye have devised and to which ye cleave and take firm hold on the precepts of god that haply ye may attain that which he hath purposed for you and be of them that pursue right course delight not yourselves in the things of the world and its vain ornaments neither set your hopes on them let your reliance be on the remembrance of god the most exalted the most great he will erelong bring to naught all the things ye possess let him be your fear and forget not his covenant with you and be not of them that are shut out as by veil from him beware that ye swell not with pride before god and disdainfully reject his loved ones defer ye humbly to the faithful they that have believed in god and in his signs whose hearts witness to his unity whose tongues proclaim his oneness and who speak not except by his leave thus do we exhort you with justice and warn you with truth that perchance ye may be awakened lay not on any soul load which ye would not wish to be laid upon you and desire not for anyone the things ye would not desire for yourselves this is my best counsel unto you did ye but observe it respect ye the divines and learned amongst you they whose conduct accords with their professions who transgress not the bounds which god hath fixed whose judgments are in conformity with his behests as revealed in his book know ye that they are the lamps of guidance unto them that are in the heavens and on the earth they who disregard and neglect the divines and learned that live amongst them—these have truly changed the favor with which god hath favored them say await ye till god will have changed his favor unto you nothing whatsoever escapeth him he knoweth the secrets both of the heavens and of the earth his knowledge embraceth all things rejoice not in what ye have done or will do in the future nor delight in the tribulation with which ye have afflicted us for ye are unable by such means as these to exalt your stations were ye to examine your works with acute discernment neither will ye be capable of detracting from the loftiness of our state nay god will add unto the recompense with which he shall reward us for having sustained with persevering patience the tribulations we have suffered he verily shall increase the reward of them that endure with patience know ye that trials and tribulations have from time immemorial been the lot of the chosen ones of god and his beloved and such of his servants as are detached from all else but him they whom neither merchandise nor traffic beguile from the remembrance of the almighty they that speak not till he hath spoken and act according to his commandment such is god’s method carried into effect of old and such will it remain in the future blessed are the steadfastly enduring they that are patient under ills and hardships who lament not over anything that befalleth them and who tread the path of resignation the day is approaching when god will have raised up people who will call to remembrance our days who will tell the tale of our trials who will demand the restitution of our rights from them that without tittle of evidence have treated us with manifest injustice god assuredly dominateth the lives of them that wronged us and is well aware of their doings he will most certainly lay hold on them for their sins he verily is the fiercest of avengers thus have we recounted unto you the tales of the one true god and sent down unto you the things he had preordained that haply ye may ask forgiveness of him may return unto him may truly repent may realize your misdeeds may shake off your slumber may be roused from your heedlessness may atone for the things that have escaped you and be of them that do good let him who will acknowledge the truth of my words and as to him that willeth not let him turn aside my sole duty is to remind you of your failure in duty towards the cause of god if perchance ye may be of them that heed my warning wherefore hearken ye unto my speech and return ye to god and repent that he through his grace may have mercy upon you may wash away your sins and forgive your trespasses the greatness of his mercy surpasseth the fury of his wrath and his grace encompasseth all who have been called into being and been clothed with the robe of life be they of the past or of the future lxvii therehath appeared in this revelation what hath never appeared before as to the infidels that have witnessed what hath been manifested they murmur and say “verily this is sorcerer who hath devised lie against god they are indeed an outcast people tell out to the nations pen of the ancient of days the things that have happened in ‘iráq tell them of the messenger whom the congregation of the divines of that land had delegated to meet us who when attaining our presence questioned us concerning certain sciences and whom we answered by virtue of the knowledge we inherently possess thy lord is verily the knower of things unseen “we testify said he “that the knowledge thou dost possess is such as none can rival such knowledge however is insufficient to vindicate the exalted station which the people ascribe to thee produce if thou speakest the truth what the combined forces of the peoples of the earth are powerless to produce thus was it irrevocably decreed in the court of the presence of thy lord the all glorious the loving “witness what is it thou seest he was dumbfounded and when he came to himself he said “i truly believe in god the all glorious the all praised “go thou to the people and tell them ‘ask whatsoever ye please powerful is he to do what he willeth nothing whatsoever be it of the past or of the future can frustrate his will say ‘o ye congregation of the divines choose any matter ye desire and ask your lord the god of mercy to reveal it unto you if he fulfill your wish by virtue of his sovereignty believe ye then in him and be not of those that reject his truth ’” “the dawn of understanding hath now broken said he “and the testimony of the all merciful is fulfilled he arose and returned unto them that sent him at the bidding of god the all glorious the well beloved days passed and he failed to come back to us eventually there came another messenger who informed us that the people had given up what they originally had purposed they are indeed contemptible people this is what happened in ‘iráq and to what reveal myself am witness this happening was noised abroad yet none was found to comprehend its meaning thus did we ordain it would that ye knew this by my self whoso hath in bygone ages asked us to produce the signs of god hath no sooner had we revealed them to him repudiated god’s truth the people however have for the most part remained heedless they whose eyes are illumined with the light of understanding will perceive the sweet savors of the all merciful and will embrace his truth these are they who are truly sincere lxviii thouwho art the fruit of my tree and the leaf thereof on thee be my glory and my mercy let not thine heart grieve over what hath befallen thee wert thou to scan the pages of the book of life thou wouldst most certainly discover that which would dissipate thy sorrows and dissolve thine anguish know thou fruit of my tree that the decrees of the sovereign ordainer as related to fate and predestination are of two kinds both are to be obeyed and accepted the one is irrevocable the other is as termed by men impending to the former all must unreservedly submit inasmuch as it is fixed and settled god however is able to alter or repeal it as the harm that must result from such change will be greater than if the decree had remained unaltered all therefore should willingly acquiesce in what god hath willed and confidently abide by the same the decree that is impending however is such that prayer and entreaty can succeed in averting it god grant that thou who art the fruit of my tree and they that are associated with thee may be shielded from its evil consequences say god my god thou hast committed into mine hands trust from thee and hast now according to the good pleasure of thy will called it back to thyself it is not for me who am handmaid of thine to say whence is this to me or wherefore hath it happened inasmuch as thou art glorified in all thine acts and art to be obeyed in thy decree thine handmaid my lord hath set her hopes on thy grace and bounty grant that she may obtain that which will draw her nigh unto thee and will profit her in every world of thine thou art the forgiving the all bountiful there is none other god but thee the ordainer the ancient of days vouchsafe thy blessings lord my god unto them that have quaffed the wine of thy love before the face of men and in spite of thine enemies have acknowledged thy unity testified to thy oneness and confessed their belief in that which hath made the limbs of the oppressors among thy creatures to quake and the flesh of the proud ones of the earth to tremble bear witness that thy sovereignty can never perish nor thy will be altered ordain for them that have set their faces towards thee and for thine handmaids that have held fast by thy cord that which beseemeth the ocean of thy bounty and the heaven of thy grace thou art he god who hath proclaimed himself as the lord of wealth and characterized all that serve him as poor and needy even as thou hast written “o ye that believe ye are but paupers in need of god but god is the all possessing the all praised having acknowledged my poverty and recognized thy wealth suffer me not to be deprived of the glory of thy riches thou art verily the supreme protector the all knowing the all wise lxix callthou to mind the behavior of ashraf’s mother whose son laid down his life in the land of zá zanján he most certainly is in the seat of truth in the presence of one who is the most powerful the almighty when the infidels so unjustly decided to put him to death they sent and fetched his mother that perchance she might admonish him and induce him to recant his faith and follow in the footsteps of them that have repudiated the truth of god the lord of all worlds no sooner did she behold the face of her son than she spoke to him such words as caused the hearts of the lovers of god and beyond them those of the concourse on high to cry out and be sore pained with grief truly thy lord knoweth what my tongue speaketh he himself beareth witness to my words and when addressing him she said “my son mine own son fail not to offer up thyself in the path of thy lord beware that thou betray not thy faith in him before whose face have bowed down in adoration all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth go thou straight on my son and persevere in the path of the lord thy god haste thee to attain the presence of him who is the well beloved of all worlds on her be my blessings and my mercy and my praise and my glory myself shall atone for the loss of her son—a son who now dwelleth within the tabernacle of my majesty and glory and whose face beameth with light that envelopeth with its radiance the maids of heaven in their celestial chambers and beyond them the inmates of my paradise and the denizens of the cities of holiness were any eye to gaze on his face he would exclaim “lo this is no other than noble angel lxx theworld’s equilibrium hath been upset through the vibrating influence of this most great this new world order mankind’s ordered life hath been revolutionized through the agency of this unique this wondrous system—the like of which mortal eyes have never witnessed immerse yourselves in the ocean of my words that ye may unravel its secrets and discover all the pearls of wisdom that lie hid in its depths take heed that ye do not vacillate in your determination to embrace the truth of this cause—a cause through which the potentialities of the might of god have been revealed and his sovereignty established with faces beaming with joy hasten ye unto him this is the changeless faith of god eternal in the past eternal in the future let him that seeketh attain it and as to him that hath refused to seek it—verily god is self sufficient above any need of his creatures say this is the infallible balance which the hand of god is holding in which all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth are weighed and their fate determined if ye be of them that believe and recognize this truth say through it the poor have been enriched the learned enlightened and the seekers enabled to ascend unto the presence of god beware lest ye make it cause of dissension amongst you be ye as firmly settled as the immovable mountain in the cause of your lord the mighty the loving lxxi benot dismayed peoples of the world when the daystar of my beauty is set and the heaven of my tabernacle is concealed from your eyes arise to further my cause and to exalt my word amongst men we are with you at all times and shall strengthen you through the power of truth we are truly almighty whoso hath recognized me will arise and serve me with such determination that the powers of earth and heaven shall be unable to defeat his purpose the peoples of the world are fast asleep were they to wake from their slumber they would hasten with eagerness unto god the all knowing the all wise they would cast away everything they possess be it all the treasures of the earth that their lord may remember them to the extent of addressing to them but one word such is the instruction given you by him who holdeth the knowledge of things hidden in tablet which the eye of creation hath not seen and which is revealed to none except his own self the omnipotent protector of all worlds so bewildered are they in the drunkenness of their evil desires that they are powerless to recognize the lord of all being whose voice calleth aloud from every direction “there is none other god but me the mighty the all wise say rejoice not in the things ye possess tonight they are yours tomorrow others will possess them thus warneth you he who is the all knowing the all informed say can ye claim that what ye own is lasting or secure nay by myself the all merciful the days of your life flee away as breath of wind and all your pomp and glory shall be folded up as were the pomp and glory of those gone before you reflect people what hath become of your bygone days your lost centuries happy the days that have been consecrated to the remembrance of god and blessed the hours which have been spent in praise of him who is the all wise by my life neither the pomp of the mighty nor the wealth of the rich nor even the ascendancy of the ungodly will endure all will perish at word from him he verily is the all powerful the all compelling the almighty what advantage is there in the earthly things which men possess that which shall profit them they have utterly neglected erelong they will awake from their slumber and find themselves unable to obtain that which hath escaped them in the days of their lord the almighty the all praised did they but know it they would renounce their all that their names may be mentioned before his throne they verily are accounted among the dead lxxii letnot your hearts be perturbed people when the glory of my presence is withdrawn and the ocean of my utterance is stilled in my presence amongst you there is wisdom and in my absence there is yet another inscrutable to all but god the incomparable the all knowing verily we behold you from our realm of glory and shall aid whosoever will arise for the triumph of our cause with the hosts of the concourse on high and company of our favored angels peoples of the earth god the eternal truth is my witness that streams of fresh and soft flowing waters have gushed from the rocks through the sweetness of the words uttered by your lord the unconstrained and still ye slumber cast away that which ye possess and on the wings of detachment soar beyond all created things thus biddeth you the lord of creation the movement of whose pen hath revolutionized the soul of mankind know ye from what heights your lord the all glorious is calling think ye that ye have recognized the pen wherewith your lord the lord of all names commandeth you nay by my life did ye but know it ye would renounce the world and would hasten with your whole hearts to the presence of the well beloved your spirits would be so transported by his word as to throw into commotion the greater world—how much more this small and petty one thus have the showers of my bounty been poured down from the heaven of my loving kindness as token of my grace that ye may be of the thankful beware lest the desires of the flesh and of corrupt inclination provoke divisions among you be ye as the fingers of one hand the members of one body thus counseleth you the pen of revelation if ye be of them that believe consider the mercy of god and his gifts he enjoineth upon you that which shall profit you though he himself can well dispense with all creatures your evil doings can never harm us neither can your good works profit us we summon you wholly for the sake of god to this every man of understanding and insight will testify lxxiii itis clear and evident that when the veils that conceal the realities of the manifestations of the names and attributes of god nay of all created things visible or invisible have been rent asunder nothing except the sign of god will remain—a sign which he himself hath placed within these realities this sign will endure as long as is the wish of the lord thy god the lord of the heavens and of the earth if such be the blessings conferred on all created things how superior must be the destiny of the true believer whose existence and life are to be regarded as the originating purpose of all creation just as the conception of faith hath existed from the beginning that hath no beginning and will endure till the end that hath no end in like manner will the true believer eternally live and endure his spirit will everlastingly circle round the will of god he will last as long as god himself will last he is revealed through the revelation of god and is hidden at his bidding it is evident that the loftiest mansions in the realm of immortality have been ordained as the habitation of them that have truly believed in god and in his signs death can never invade that holy seat thus have we entrusted thee with the signs of thy lord that thou mayest persevere in thy love for him and be of them that comprehend this truth lxxiv everyword that proceedeth out of the mouth of god is endowed with such potency as can instill new life into every human frame if ye be of them that comprehend this truth all the wondrous works ye behold in this world have been manifested through the operation of his supreme and most exalted will his wondrous and inflexible purpose through the mere revelation of the word “fashioner issuing forth from his lips and proclaiming his attribute to mankind such power is released as can generate through successive ages all the manifold arts which the hands of man can produce this verily is certain truth no sooner is this resplendent word uttered than its animating energies stirring within all created things give birth to the means and instruments whereby such arts can be produced and perfected all the wondrous achievements ye now witness are the direct consequences of the revelation of this name in the days to come ye will verily behold things of which ye have never heard before thus hath it been decreed in the tablets of god and none can comprehend it except them whose sight is sharp in like manner the moment the word expressing my attribute “the omniscient” issueth forth from my mouth every created thing will according to its capacity and limitations be invested with the power to unfold the knowledge of the most marvelous sciences and will be empowered to manifest them in the course of time at the bidding of him who is the almighty the all knowing know thou of certainty that the revelation of every other name is accompanied by similar manifestation of divine power every single letter proceeding out of the mouth of god is indeed mother letter and every word uttered by him who is the wellspring of divine revelation is mother word and his tablet mother tablet well is it with them that apprehend this truth lxxv tearasunder in my name the veils that have grievously blinded your vision and through the power born of your belief in the unity of god scatter the idols of vain imitation enter then the holy paradise of the good pleasure of the all merciful sanctify your souls from whatsoever is not of god and taste ye the sweetness of rest within the pale of his vast and mighty revelation and beneath the shadow of his supreme and infallible authority suffer not yourselves to be wrapt in the dense veils of your selfish desires inasmuch as have perfected in every one of you my creation so that the excellence of my handiwork may be fully revealed unto men it follows therefore that every man hath been and will continue to be able of himself to appreciate the beauty of god the glorified had he not been endowed with such capacity how could he be called to account for his failure if in the day when all the peoples of the earth will be gathered together any man should whilst standing in the presence of god be asked “wherefore hast thou disbelieved in my beauty and turned away from my self and if such man should reply and say “inasmuch as all men have erred and none hath been found willing to turn his face to the truth too following their example have grievously failed to recognize the beauty of the eternal such plea will assuredly be rejected for the faith of no man can be conditioned by anyone except himself this is one of the verities that lie enshrined in my revelation—a verity which have revealed in all the heavenly books which have caused the tongue of grandeur to utter and the pen of power to inscribe ponder awhile thereon that with both your inner and outer eye ye may perceive the subtleties of divine wisdom and discover the gems of heavenly knowledge which in clear and weighty language have revealed in this exalted and incorruptible tablet and that ye may not stray far from the all highest throne from the tree beyond which there is no passing from the habitation of everlasting might and glory the signs of god shine as manifest and resplendent as the sun amidst the works of his creatures whatsoever proceedeth from him is apart and will always remain distinguished from the inventions of men from the source of his knowledge countless luminaries of learning and wisdom have risen and out of the paradise of his pen the breath of the all merciful hath continually been wafted to the hearts and souls of men happy are they that have recognized this truth lxxvi giveear my servant unto that which is being sent down unto thee from the throne of thy lord the inaccessible the most great there is none other god but him he hath called into being his creatures that they may know him who is the compassionate the all merciful unto the cities of all nations he hath sent his messengers whom he hath commissioned to announce unto men tidings of the paradise of his good pleasure and to draw them nigh unto the haven of abiding security the seat of eternal holiness and transcendent glory some were guided by the light of god gained admittance into the court of his presence and quaffed from the hand of resignation the waters of everlasting life and were accounted of them that have truly recognized and believed in him others rebelled against him and rejected the signs of god the most powerful the almighty the all wise ages rolled away until they attained their consummation in this the lord of days the day whereon the daystar of the bayán manifested itself above the horizon of mercy the day in which the beauty of the all glorious shone forth in the exalted person of ‘alí muḥammad the báb no sooner did he reveal himself than all the people rose up against him by some he was denounced as one that hath uttered slanders against god the almighty the ancient of days others regarded him as man smitten with madness an allegation which myself have heard from the lips of one of the divines still others disputed his claim to be the mouthpiece of god and stigmatized him as one who had stolen and used as his the words of the almighty who had perverted their meaning and mingled them with his own the eye of grandeur weepeth sore for the things which their mouths have uttered while they continue to rejoice upon their seats “god said he “is my witness people am come to you with revelation from the lord your god the lord of your fathers of old look not people at the things ye possess look rather at the things god hath sent down unto you this surely will be better for you than the whole of creation could ye but perceive it repeat the gaze people and consider the testimony of god and his proof which are in your possession and compare them unto the revelation sent down unto you in this day that the truth the infallible truth may be indubitably manifested unto you follow not people the steps of the evil one follow ye the faith of the all merciful and be ye of them that truly believe what would it profit man if he were to fail to recognize the revelation of god nothing whatever to this mine own self the omnipotent the omniscient the all wise will testify the more he exhorted them the fiercer grew their enmity till at the last they put him to death with shameful cruelty the curse of god be upon the oppressors few believed in him few of our servants are the thankful these he admonished in all his tablets—nay in every passage of his wondrous writings—not to give themselves up in the day of the promised revelation to anything whatever be it in the heaven or in the earth “o people said he “i have revealed myself for his manifestation and have caused my book the bayán to descend upon you for no other purpose except to establish the truth of his cause fear ye god and contend not with him as the people of the qur’án have contended with me at whatever time ye hear of him hasten ye towards him and cleave ye to whatsoever he may reveal unto you naught else besides him can ever profit you no not though ye produce from first to last the testimonies of all those who were before you and when after the lapse of few years the heaven of divine decree was cleft asunder and the beauty of the báb appeared in the clouds of the names of god arrayed in new raiment these same people maliciously rose up against him whose light embraceth all created things they broke his covenant rejected his truth contended with him caviled at his signs treated his testimony as falsehood and joined the company of the infidels eventually they determined to take away his life such is the state of them who are in far gone error and when they realized their powerlessness to achieve their purpose they arose to plot against him witness how every moment they devise fresh device to harm him that they may injure and dishonor the cause of god say woe be to you by god your schemings cover you with shame your lord the god of mercy can well dispense with all creatures nothing whatever can either increase or diminish the things he doth possess if ye believe to your own behoof will ye believe and if ye believe not ye yourselves will suffer at no time can the hand of the infidel profane the hem of his robe my servant that believest in god by the righteousness of the almighty were to recount to thee the tale of the things that have befallen me the souls and minds of men would be incapable of sustaining its weight god himself beareth me witness watch over thyself and follow not the footsteps of these people meditate diligently upon the cause of thy lord strive to know him through his own self and not through others for no one else besides him can ever profit thee to this all created things will testify couldst thou but perceive it emerge from behind the veil by the leave of thy lord the all glorious the most powerful and seize before the eyes of those who are in the heavens and those who are on the earth the chalice of immortality in the name of thy lord the inaccessible the most high and quaff thy fill and be not of them that tarry swear by god the moment thou touchest the cup with thy lips the concourse on high will acclaim thee saying “drink with healthy relish man that hast truly believed in god and the inhabitants of the cities of immortality will cry out “joy be to thee thou that hast drained the cup of his love and the tongue of grandeur will hail thee “great is the blessedness that awaiteth thee my servant for thou hast attained unto that which none hath attained except such as have detached themselves from all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth and who are the emblems of true detachment lxxvii andnow concerning thy question regarding the creation of man know thou that all men have been created in the nature made by god the guardian the self subsisting unto each one hath been prescribed preordained measure as decreed in god’s mighty and guarded tablets all that which ye potentially possess can however be manifested only as result of your own volition your own acts testify to this truth consider for instance that which hath been forbidden in the bayán unto men god hath in that book and by his behest decreed as lawful whatsoever he hath pleased to decree and hath through the power of his sovereign might forbidden whatsoever he elected to forbid to this testifieth the text of that book will ye not bear witness men however have wittingly broken his law is such behavior to be attributed to god or to their proper selves be fair in your judgment every good thing is of god and every evil thing is from yourselves will ye not comprehend this same truth hath been revealed in all the scriptures if ye be of them that understand every act ye meditate is as clear to him as is that act when already accomplished there is none other god besides him his is all creation and its empire all stands revealed before him all is recorded in his holy and hidden tablets this foreknowledge of god however should not be regarded as having caused the actions of men just as your own previous knowledge that certain event is to occur or your desire that it should happen is not and can never be the reason for its occurrence lxxviii asto thy question concerning the origin of creation know assuredly that god’s creation hath existed from eternity and will continue to exist forever its beginning hath had no beginning and its end knoweth no end his name the creator presupposeth creation even as his title the lord of men must involve the existence of servant as to those sayings attributed to the prophets of old such as “in the beginning was god there was no creature to know him and “the lord was alone with no one to adore him the meaning of these and similar sayings is clear and evident and should at no time be misapprehended to this same truth bear witness these words which he hath revealed “god was alone there was none else besides him he will always remain what he hath ever been every discerning eye will readily perceive that the lord is now manifest yet there is none to recognize his glory by this is meant that the habitation wherein the divine being dwelleth is far above the reach and ken of anyone besides him whatsoever in the contingent world can either be expressed or apprehended can never transgress the limits which by its inherent nature have been imposed upon it god alone transcendeth such limitations he verily is from everlasting no peer or partner has been or can ever be joined with him no name can be compared with his name no pen can portray his nature neither can any tongue depict his glory he will forever remain immeasurably exalted above anyone except himself consider the hour at which the supreme manifestation of god revealeth himself unto men ere that hour cometh the ancient being who is still unknown of men and hath not as yet given utterance to the word of god is himself the all knower in world devoid of any man that hath known him he is indeed the creator without creation for at the very moment preceding his revelation each and every created thing shall be made to yield up its soul to god this is indeed the day of which it hath been written “whose shall be the kingdom this day and none can be found ready to answer lxxix asto thy question concerning the worlds of god know thou of truth that the worlds of god are countless in their number and infinite in their range none can reckon or comprehend them except god the all knowing the all wise consider thy state when asleep verily say this phenomenon is the most mysterious of the signs of god amongst men were they to ponder it in their hearts behold how the thing which thou hast seen in thy dream is after considerable lapse of time fully realized had the world in which thou didst find thyself in thy dream been identical with the world in which thou livest it would have been necessary for the event occurring in that dream to have transpired in this world at the very moment of its occurrence were it so you yourself would have borne witness unto it this being not the case however it must necessarily follow that the world in which thou livest is different and apart from that which thou hast experienced in thy dream this latter world hath neither beginning nor end it would be true if thou wert to contend that this same world is as decreed by the all glorious and almighty god within thy proper self and is wrapped up within thee it would equally be true to maintain that thy spirit having transcended the limitations of sleep and having stripped itself of all earthly attachment hath by the act of god been made to traverse realm which lieth hidden in the innermost reality of this world verily say the creation of god embraceth worlds besides this world and creatures apart from these creatures in each of these worlds he hath ordained things which none can search except himself the all searching the all wise do thou meditate on that which we have revealed unto thee that thou mayest discover the purpose of god thy lord and the lord of all worlds in these words the mysteries of divine wisdom have been treasured we have refrained from dwelling upon this theme owing to the sorrow that hath encompassed us from the actions of them that have been created through our words if ye be of them that will hearken unto our voice lxxx thouhast asked me whether man as apart from the prophets of god and his chosen ones will retain after his physical death the self same individuality personality consciousness and understanding that characterize his life in this world if this should be the case how is it thou hast observed that whereas such slight injuries to his mental faculties as fainting and severe illness deprive him of his understanding and consciousness his death which must involve the decomposition of his body and the dissolution of its elements is powerless to destroy that understanding and extinguish that consciousness how can anyone imagine that man’s consciousness and personality will be maintained when the very instruments necessary to their existence and function will have completely disintegrated know thou that the soul of man is exalted above and is independent of all infirmities of body or mind that sick person showeth signs of weakness is due to the hindrances that interpose themselves between his soul and his body for the soul itself remaineth unaffected by any bodily ailments consider the light of the lamp though an external object may interfere with its radiance the light itself continueth to shine with undiminished power in like manner every malady afflicting the body of man is an impediment that preventeth the soul from manifesting its inherent might and power when it leaveth the body however it will evince such ascendancy and reveal such influence as no force on earth can equal every pure every refined and sanctified soul will be endowed with tremendous power and shall rejoice with exceeding gladness consider the lamp which is hidden under bushel though its light be shining yet its radiance is concealed from men likewise consider the sun which hath been obscured by the clouds observe how its splendor appeareth to have diminished when in reality the source of that light hath remained unchanged the soul of man should be likened unto this sun and all things on earth should be regarded as his body so long as no external impediment interveneth between them the body will in its entirety continue to reflect the light of the soul and to be sustained by its power as soon as however veil interposeth itself between them the brightness of that light seemeth to lessen consider again the sun when it is completely hidden behind the clouds though the earth is still illumined with its light yet the measure of light which it receiveth is considerably reduced not until the clouds have dispersed can the sun shine again in the plenitude of its glory neither the presence of the cloud nor its absence can in any way affect the inherent splendor of the sun the soul of man is the sun by which his body is illumined and from which it draweth its sustenance and should be so regarded consider moreover how the fruit ere it is formed lieth potentially within the tree were the tree to be cut into pieces no sign nor any part of the fruit however small could be detected when it appeareth however it manifesteth itself as thou hast observed in its wondrous beauty and glorious perfection certain fruits indeed attain their fullest development only after being severed from the tree lxxxi andnow concerning thy question regarding the soul of man and its survival after death know thou of truth that the soul after its separation from the body will continue to progress until it attaineth the presence of god in state and condition which neither the revolution of ages and centuries nor the changes and chances of this world can alter it will endure as long as the kingdom of god his sovereignty his dominion and power will endure it will manifest the signs of god and his attributes and will reveal his loving kindness and bounty the movement of my pen is stilled when it attempteth to befittingly describe the loftiness and glory of so exalted station the honor with which the hand of mercy will invest the soul is such as no tongue can adequately reveal nor any other earthly agency describe blessed is the soul which at the hour of its separation from the body is sanctified from the vain imaginings of the peoples of the world such soul liveth and moveth in accordance with the will of its creator and entereth the all highest paradise the maids of heaven inmates of the loftiest mansions will circle around it and the prophets of god and his chosen ones will seek its companionship with them that soul will freely converse and will recount unto them that which it hath been made to endure in the path of god the lord of all worlds if any man be told that which hath been ordained for such soul in the worlds of god the lord of the throne on high and of earth below his whole being will instantly blaze out in his great longing to attain that most exalted that sanctified and resplendent station the nature of the soul after death can never be described nor is it meet and permissible to reveal its whole character to the eyes of men the prophets and messengers of god have been sent down for the sole purpose of guiding mankind to the straight path of truth the purpose underlying their revelation hath been to educate all men that they may at the hour of death ascend in the utmost purity and sanctity and with absolute detachment to the throne of the most high the light which these souls radiate is responsible for the progress of the world and the advancement of its peoples they are like unto leaven which leaveneth the world of being and constitute the animating force through which the arts and wonders of the world are made manifest through them the clouds rain their bounty upon men and the earth bringeth forth its fruits all things must needs have cause motive power an animating principle these souls and symbols of detachment have provided and will continue to provide the supreme moving impulse in the world of being the world beyond is as different from this world as this world is different from that of the child while still in the womb of its mother when the soul attaineth the presence of god it will assume the form that best befitteth its immortality and is worthy of its celestial habitation such an existence is contingent and not an absolute existence inasmuch as the former is preceded by cause whilst the latter is independent thereof absolute existence is strictly confined to god exalted be his glory well is it with them that apprehend this truth wert thou to ponder in thine heart the behavior of the prophets of god thou wouldst assuredly and readily testify that there must needs be other worlds besides this world the majority of the truly wise and learned have throughout the ages as it hath been recorded by the pen of glory in the tablet of wisdom borne witness to the truth of that which the holy writ of god hath revealed even the materialists have testified in their writings to the wisdom of these divinely appointed messengers and have regarded the references made by the prophets to paradise to hell fire to future reward and punishment to have been actuated by desire to educate and uplift the souls of men consider therefore how the generality of mankind whatever their beliefs or theories have recognized the excellence and admitted the superiority of these prophets of god these gems of detachment are acclaimed by some as the embodiments of wisdom while others believe them to be the mouthpiece of god himself how could such souls have consented to surrender themselves unto their enemies if they believed all the worlds of god to have been reduced to this earthly life would they have willingly suffered such afflictions and torments as no man hath ever experienced or witnessed lxxxii thouhast asked me concerning the nature of the soul know verily that the soul is sign of god heavenly gem whose reality the most learned of men hath failed to grasp and whose mystery no mind however acute can ever hope to unravel it is the first among all created things to declare the excellence of its creator the first to recognize his glory to cleave to his truth and to bow down in adoration before him if it be faithful to god it will reflect his light and will eventually return unto him if it fail however in its allegiance to its creator it will become victim to self and passion and will in the end sink in their depths whoso hath in this day refused to allow the doubts and fancies of men to turn him away from him who is the eternal truth and hath not suffered the tumult provoked by the ecclesiastical and secular authorities to deter him from recognizing his message such man will be regarded by god the lord of all men as one of his mighty signs and will be numbered among them whose names have been inscribed by the pen of the most high in his book blessed is he that hath recognized the true stature of such soul that hath acknowledged its station and discovered its virtues much hath been written in the books of old concerning the various stages in the development of the soul such as concupiscence irascibility inspiration benevolence contentment divine good pleasure and the like the pen of the most high however is disinclined to dwell upon them every soul that walketh humbly with its god in this day and cleaveth unto him shall find itself invested with the honor and glory of all goodly names and stations when man is asleep his soul can in no wise be said to have been inherently affected by any external object it is not susceptible of any change in its original state or character any variation in its functions is to be ascribed to external causes it is to these external influences that any variations in its environment its understanding and perception should be attributed consider the human eye though it hath the faculty of perceiving all created things yet the slightest impediment may so obstruct its vision as to deprive it of the power of discerning any object whatsoever magnified be the name of him who hath created and is the cause of these causes who hath ordained that every change and variation in the world of being be made dependent upon them every created thing in the whole universe is but door leading into his knowledge sign of his sovereignty revelation of his names symbol of his majesty token of his power means of admittance into his straight path verily say the human soul is in its essence one of the signs of god mystery among his mysteries it is one of the mighty signs of the almighty the harbinger that proclaimeth the reality of all the worlds of god within it lieth concealed that which the world is now utterly incapable of apprehending ponder in thine heart the revelation of the soul of god that pervadeth all his laws and contrast it with that base and appetitive nature that hath rebelled against him that forbiddeth men to turn unto the lord of names and impelleth them to walk after their lusts and wickedness such soul hath in truth wandered far in the path of error thou hast moreover asked me concerning the state of the soul after its separation from the body know thou of truth that if the soul of man hath walked in the ways of god it will assuredly return and be gathered to the glory of the beloved by the righteousness of god it shall attain station such as no pen can depict or tongue describe the soul that hath remained faithful to the cause of god and stood unwaveringly firm in his path shall after his ascension be possessed of such power that all the worlds which the almighty hath created can benefit through him such soul provideth at the bidding of the ideal king and divine educator the pure leaven that leaveneth the world of being and furnisheth the power through which the arts and wonders of the world are made manifest consider how meal needeth leaven to be leavened with those souls that are the symbols of detachment are the leaven of the world meditate on this and be of the thankful in several of our tablets we have referred to this theme and have set forth the various stages in the development of the soul verily say the human soul is exalted above all egress and regress it is still and yet it soareth it moveth and yet it is still it is in itself testimony that beareth witness to the existence of world that is contingent as well as to the reality of world that hath neither beginning nor end behold how the dream thou hast dreamed is after the lapse of many years reenacted before thine eyes consider how strange is the mystery of the world that appeareth to thee in thy dream ponder in thine heart upon the unsearchable wisdom of god and meditate on its manifold revelations witness the wondrous evidences of god’s handiwork and reflect upon its range and character he who is the seal of the prophets hath said “increase my wonder and amazement at thee god as to thy question whether the physical world is subject to any limitations know thou that the comprehension of this matter dependeth upon the observer himself in one sense it is limited in another it is exalted beyond all limitations the one true god hath everlastingly existed and will everlastingly continue to exist his creation likewise hath had no beginning and will have no end all that is created however is preceded by cause this fact in itself establisheth beyond the shadow of doubt the unity of the creator thou hast moreover asked me concerning the nature of the celestial spheres to comprehend their nature it would be necessary to inquire into the meaning of the allusions that have been made in the books of old to the celestial spheres and the heavens and to discover the character of their relationship to this physical world and the influence which they exert upon it every heart is filled with wonder at so bewildering theme and every mind is perplexed by its mystery god alone can fathom its import the learned men that have fixed at several thousand years the life of this earth have failed throughout the long period of their observation to consider either the number or the age of the other planets consider moreover the manifold divergencies that have resulted from the theories propounded by these men know thou that every fixed star hath its own planets and every planet its own creatures whose number no man can compute thou that hast fixed thine eyes upon my countenance the dayspring of glory hath in this day manifested its radiance and the voice of the most high is calling we have formerly uttered these words “this is not the day for any man to question his lord it behooveth whosoever hath hearkened to the call of god as voiced by him who is the dayspring of glory to arise and cry out ‘here am here am lord of all names here am here am maker of the heavens testify that through thy revelation the things hidden in the books of god have been revealed and that whatsoever hath been recorded by thy messengers in the sacred scriptures hath been fulfilled ’” lxxxiii considerthe rational faculty with which god hath endowed the essence of man examine thine own self and behold how thy motion and stillness thy will and purpose thy sight and hearing thy sense of smell and power of speech and whatever else is related to or transcendeth thy physical senses or spiritual perceptions all proceed from and owe their existence to this same faculty so closely are they related unto it that if in less than the twinkling of an eye its relationship to the human body be severed each and every one of these senses will cease immediately to exercise its function and will be deprived of the power to manifest the evidences of its activity it is indubitably clear and evident that each of these aforementioned instruments has depended and will ever continue to depend for its proper functioning on this rational faculty which should be regarded as sign of the revelation of him who is the sovereign lord of all through its manifestation all these names and attributes have been revealed and by the suspension of its action they are all destroyed and perish it would be wholly untrue to maintain that this faculty is the same as the power of vision inasmuch as the power of vision is derived from it and acteth in dependence upon it it would likewise be idle to contend that this faculty can be identified with the sense of hearing as the sense of hearing receiveth from the rational faculty the requisite energy for performing its functions this same relationship bindeth this faculty with whatsoever hath been the recipient of these names and attributes within the human temple these diverse names and revealed attributes have been generated through the agency of this sign of god immeasurably exalted is this sign in its essence and reality above all such names and attributes nay all else besides it will when compared with its glory fade into utter nothingness and become thing forgotten wert thou to ponder in thine heart from now until the end that hath no end and with all the concentrated intelligence and understanding which the greatest minds have attained in the past or will attain in the future this divinely ordained and subtle reality this sign of the revelation of the all abiding all glorious god thou wilt fail to comprehend its mystery or to appraise its virtue having recognized thy powerlessness to attain to an adequate understanding of that reality which abideth within thee thou wilt readily admit the futility of such efforts as may be attempted by thee or by any of the created things to fathom the mystery of the living god the daystar of unfading glory the ancient of everlasting days this confession of helplessness which mature contemplation must eventually impel every mind to make is in itself the acme of human understanding and marketh the culmination of man’s development lxxxiv regardthou the one true god as one who is apart from and immeasurably exalted above all created things the whole universe reflecteth his glory while he is himself independent of and transcendeth his creatures this is the true meaning of divine unity he who is the eternal truth is the one power who exerciseth undisputed sovereignty over the world of being whose image is reflected in the mirror of the entire creation all existence is dependent upon him and from him is derived the source of the sustenance of all things this is what is meant by divine unity this is its fundamental principle some deluded by their idle fancies have conceived all created things as associates and partners of god and imagined themselves to be the exponents of his unity by him who is the one true god such men have been and will continue to remain the victims of blind imitation and are to be numbered with them that have restricted and limited the conception of god he is true believer in divine unity who far from confusing duality with oneness refuseth to allow any notion of multiplicity to becloud his conception of the singleness of god who will regard the divine being as one who by his very nature transcendeth the limitations of numbers the essence of belief in divine unity consisteth in regarding him who is the manifestation of god and him who is the invisible the inaccessible the unknowable essence as one and the same by this is meant that whatever pertaineth to the former all his acts and doings whatever he ordaineth or forbiddeth should be considered in all their aspects and under all circumstances and without any reservation as identical with the will of god himself this is the loftiest station to which true believer in the unity of god can ever hope to attain blessed is the man that reacheth this station and is of them that are steadfast in their belief lxxxv myservants it behooveth you to refresh and revive your souls through the gracious favors which in this divine this soul stirring springtime are being showered upon you the daystar of his great glory hath shed its radiance upon you and the clouds of his limitless grace have overshadowed you how high the reward of him that hath not deprived himself of so great bounty nor failed to recognize the beauty of his best beloved in this his new attire say people the lamp of god is burning take heed lest the fierce winds of your disobedience extinguish its light now is the time to arise and magnify the lord your god strive not after bodily comforts and keep your heart pure and stainless the evil one is lying in wait ready to entrap you gird yourselves against his wicked devices and led by the light of the name of the one true god deliver yourselves from the darkness that surroundeth you center your thoughts in the well beloved rather than in your own selves say ye that have strayed and lost your way the divine messenger who speaketh naught but the truth hath announced unto you the coming of the best beloved behold he is now come wherefore are ye downcast and dejected why remain despondent when the pure and hidden one hath appeared unveiled amongst you he who is both the beginning and the end he who is both stillness and motion is now manifest before your eyes behold how in this day the beginning is reflected in the end how out of stillness motion hath been engendered this motion hath been generated by the potent energies which the words of the almighty have released throughout the entire creation whoso hath been quickened by its vitalizing power will find himself impelled to attain the court of the beloved and whoso hath deprived himself therefrom will sink into irretrievable despondency he is truly wise whom the world and all that is therein have not deterred from recognizing the light of this day who will not allow men’s idle talk to cause him to swerve from the way of righteousness he is indeed as one dead who at the wondrous dawn of this revelation hath failed to be quickened by its soul stirring breeze he is indeed captive who hath not recognized the supreme redeemer but hath suffered his soul to be bound distressed and helpless in the fetters of his desires my servants whoso hath tasted of this fountain hath attained unto everlasting life and whoso hath refused to drink therefrom is even as the dead say ye workers of iniquity covetousness hath hindered you from giving hearing ear unto the sweet voice of him who is the all sufficing wash it away from your hearts that his divine secret may be made known unto you behold him manifest and resplendent as the sun in all its glory say ye that are bereft of understanding severe trial pursueth you and will suddenly overtake you bestir yourselves that haply it may pass and inflict no harm upon you acknowledge the exalted character of the name of the lord your god who hath come unto you in the greatness of his glory he verily is the all knowing the all possessing the supreme protector lxxxvi andnow concerning thy question whether human souls continue to be conscious one of another after their separation from the body know thou that the souls of the people of bahá who have entered and been established within the crimson ark shall associate and commune intimately one with another and shall be so closely associated in their lives their aspirations their aims and strivings as to be even as one soul they are indeed the ones who are well informed who are keen sighted and who are endued with understanding thus hath it been decreed by him who is the all knowing the all wise the people of bahá who are the inmates of the ark of god are one and all well aware of one another’s state and condition and are united in the bonds of intimacy and fellowship such state however must depend upon their faith and their conduct they that are of the same grade and station are fully aware of one another’s capacity character accomplishments and merits they that are of lower grade however are incapable of comprehending adequately the station or of estimating the merits of those that rank above them each shall receive his share from thy lord blessed is the man that hath turned his face towards god and walked steadfastly in his love until his soul hath winged its flight unto god the sovereign lord of all the most powerful the ever forgiving the all merciful the souls of the infidels however shall—and to this bear witness—when breathing their last be made aware of the good things that have escaped them and shall bemoan their plight and shall humble themselves before god they shall continue doing so after the separation of their souls from their bodies it is clear and evident that all men shall after their physical death estimate the worth of their deeds and realize all that their hands have wrought swear by the daystar that shineth above the horizon of divine power they that are the followers of the one true god shall the moment they depart out of this life experience such joy and gladness as would be impossible to describe while they that live in error shall be seized with such fear and trembling and shall be filled with such consternation as nothing can exceed well is it with him that hath quaffed the choice and incorruptible wine of faith through the gracious favor and the manifold bounties of him who is the lord of all faiths this is the day when the loved ones of god should keep their eyes directed towards his manifestation and fasten them upon whatsoever that manifestation may be pleased to reveal certain traditions of bygone ages rest on no foundations whatever while the notions entertained by past generations and which they have recorded in their books have for the most part been influenced by the desires of corrupt inclination thou dost witness how most of the commentaries and interpretations of the words of god now current amongst men are devoid of truth their falsity hath in some cases been exposed when the intervening veils were rent asunder they themselves have acknowledged their failure in apprehending the meaning of any of the words of god our purpose is to show that should the loved ones of god sanctify their hearts and their ears from the vain sayings that were uttered aforetime and turn with their inmost souls to him who is the dayspring of his revelation and to whatsoever things he hath manifested such behavior would be regarded as highly meritorious in the sight of god magnify his name and be thou of the thankful convey my greetings to my loved ones whom god hath singled out for his love and caused them to achieve their objects all glory be to god the lord of all worlds lxxxvii andnow regarding thy question “how is it that no records are to be found concerning the prophets that have preceded adam the father of mankind or of the kings that lived in the days of those prophets know thou that the absence of any reference to them is no proof that they did not actually exist that no records concerning them are now available should be attributed to their extreme remoteness as well as to the vast changes which the earth hath undergone since their time moreover such forms and modes of writing as are now current amongst men were unknown to the generations that were before adam there was even time when men were wholly ignorant of the art of writing and had adopted system entirely different from the one which they now use for proper exposition of this an elaborate explanation would be required consider the differences that have arisen since the days of adam the divers and widely known languages now spoken by the peoples of the earth were originally unknown as were the varied rules and customs now prevailing amongst them the people of those times spoke language different from those now known diversities of language arose in later age in land known as babel it was given the name babel because the term signifieth “the place where the confusion of tongues arose subsequently syriac became prominent among the existing languages the sacred scriptures of former times were revealed in that tongue later abraham the friend of god appeared and shed upon the world the light of divine revelation the language he spoke while he crossed the jordan became known as hebrew ‘ibrání which meaneth “the language of the crossing the books of god and the sacred scriptures were then revealed in that tongue and not until after considerable lapse of time did arabic become the language of revelation witness therefore how numerous and far reaching have been the changes in language speech and writing since the days of adam how much greater must have been the changes before him our purpose in revealing these words is to show that the one true god hath in his all highest and transcendent station ever been and will everlastingly continue to be exalted above the praise and conception of all else but him his creation hath ever existed and the manifestations of his divine glory and the daysprings of eternal holiness have been sent down from time immemorial and been commissioned to summon mankind to the one true god that the names of some of them are forgotten and the records of their lives lost is to be attributed to the disturbances and changes that have overtaken the world mention hath been made in certain books of deluge which caused all that existed on earth historical records as well as other things to be destroyed moreover many cataclysms have occurred which have effaced the traces of many events furthermore among existing historical records differences are to be found and each of the various peoples of the world hath its own account of the age of the earth and of its history some trace their history as far back as eight thousand years others as far as twelve thousand years to anyone that hath read the book of júk it is clear and evident how much the accounts given by the various books have differed please god thou wilt turn thine eyes towards the most great revelation and entirely disregard these conflicting tales and traditions lxxxviii knowverily that the essence of justice and the source thereof are both embodied in the ordinances prescribed by him who is the manifestation of the self of god amongst men if ye be of them that recognize this truth he doth verily incarnate the highest the infallible standard of justice unto all creation were his law to be such as to strike terror into the hearts of all that are in heaven and on earth that law is naught but manifest justice the fears and agitation which the revelation of this law provoketh in men’s hearts should indeed be likened to the cries of the suckling babe weaned from his mother’s milk if ye be of them that perceive were men to discover the motivating purpose of god’s revelation they would assuredly cast away their fears and with hearts filled with gratitude rejoice with exceeding gladness lxxxix knowassuredly that just as thou firmly believest that the word of god exalted be his glory endureth forever thou must likewise believe with undoubting faith that its meaning can never be exhausted they who are its appointed interpreters they whose hearts are the repositories of its secrets are however the only ones who can comprehend its manifold wisdom whoso while reading the sacred scriptures is tempted to choose therefrom whatever may suit him with which to challenge the authority of the representative of god among men is indeed as one dead though to outward seeming he may walk and converse with his neighbors and share with them their food and their drink oh would that the world could believe me were all the things that lie enshrined within the heart of bahá and which the lord his god the lord of all names hath taught him to be unveiled to mankind every man on earth would be dumbfounded how great the multitude of truths which the garment of words can never contain how vast the number of such verities as no expression can adequately describe whose significance can never be unfolded and to which not even the remotest allusions can be made how manifold are the truths which must remain unuttered until the appointed time is come even as it hath been said “not everything that man knoweth can be disclosed nor can everything that he can disclose be regarded as timely nor can every timely utterance be considered as suited to the capacity of those who hear it of these truths some can be disclosed only to the extent of the capacity of the repositories of the light of our knowledge and the recipients of our hidden grace we beseech god to strengthen thee with his power and enable thee to recognize him who is the source of all knowledge that thou mayest detach thyself from all human learning for “what would it profit any man to strive after learning when he hath already found and recognized him who is the object of all knowledge cleave to the root of knowledge and to him who is the fountain thereof that thou mayest find thyself independent of all who claim to be well versed in human learning and whose claim no clear proof nor the testimony of any enlightening book can support xc whateveris in the heavens and whatever is on the earth is direct evidence of the revelation within it of the attributes and names of god inasmuch as within every atom are enshrined the signs that bear eloquent testimony to the revelation of that most great light methinks but for the potency of that revelation no being could ever exist how resplendent the luminaries of knowledge that shine in an atom and how vast the oceans of wisdom that surge within drop to supreme degree is this true of man who among all created things hath been invested with the robe of such gifts and hath been singled out for the glory of such distinction for in him are potentially revealed all the attributes and names of god to degree that no other created being hath excelled or surpassed all these names and attributes are applicable to him even as he hath said “man is my mystery and am his mystery manifold are the verses that have been repeatedly revealed in all the heavenly books and the holy scriptures expressive of this most subtle and lofty theme even as he hath revealed “we will surely show them our signs in the world and within themselves again he saith “and also in your own selves will ye not then behold the signs of god and yet again he revealeth “and be ye not like those who forget god and whom he hath therefore caused to forget their own selves in this connection he who is the eternal king—may the souls of all that dwell within the mystic tabernacle be sacrifice unto him—hath spoken “he hath known god who hath known himself …from that which hath been said it becometh evident that all things in their inmost reality testify to the revelation of the names and attributes of god within them each according to its capacity indicateth and is expressive of the knowledge of god so potent and universal is this revelation that it hath encompassed all things visible and invisible thus hath he revealed “hath aught else save thee power of revelation which is not possessed by thee that it could have manifested thee blind is the eye which doth not perceive thee likewise hath the eternal king spoken “no thing have perceived except that perceived god within it god before it or god after it also in the tradition of kumayl it is written “behold light hath shone forth out of the morn of eternity and lo its waves have penetrated the inmost reality of all men man the noblest and most perfect of all created things excelleth them all in the intensity of this revelation and is fuller expression of its glory and of all men the most accomplished the most distinguished and the most excellent are the manifestations of the sun of truth nay all else besides these manifestations live by the operation of their will and move and have their being through the outpourings of their grace xci amongstthe proofs demonstrating the truth of this revelation is this that in every age and dispensation whenever the invisible essence was revealed in the person of his manifestation certain souls obscure and detached from all worldly entanglements would seek illumination from the sun of prophethood and moon of divine guidance and would attain unto the divine presence for this reason the divines of the age and those possessed of wealth would scorn and scoff at these people even as he hath revealed concerning them that erred “then said the chiefs of his people who believed not ‘we see in thee but man like ourselves and we see not any who have followed thee except our meanest ones of hasty judgment nor see we any excellence in you above ourselves nay we deem you liars ’” they caviled at those holy manifestations and protested saying “none hath followed you except the abject amongst us those who are worthy of no attention their aim was to show that no one amongst the learned the wealthy and the renowned believed in them by this and similar proofs they sought to demonstrate the falsity of him that speaketh naught but the truth in this most resplendent dispensation however this most mighty sovereignty number of illumined divines of men of consummate learning of doctors of mature wisdom have attained unto his court drunk the cup of his divine presence and been invested with the honor of his most excellent favor they have renounced for the sake of the beloved the world and all that is therein all these were guided by the light of the sun of divine revelation confessed and acknowledged his truth such was their faith that most of them renounced their substance and kindred and cleaved to the good pleasure of the all glorious they laid down their lives for their well beloved and surrendered their all in his path their breasts were made targets for the darts of the enemy and their heads adorned the spears of the infidel no land remained which did not drink the blood of these embodiments of detachment and no sword that did not bruise their necks their deeds alone testify to the truth of their words doth not the testimony of these holy souls who have so gloriously risen to offer up their lives for their beloved that the whole world marveled at the manner of their sacrifice suffice the people of this day is it not sufficient witness against the faithlessness of those who for trifle betrayed their faith who bartered away immortality for that which perisheth who gave up the kawthar of the divine presence for salty springs and whose one aim in life is to usurp the property of others even as thou dost witness how all of them have busied themselves with the vanities of the world and have strayed far from him who is the lord the most high be fair is the testimony of those acceptable and worthy of attention whose deeds agree with their words whose outward behavior conformeth with their inner life the mind is bewildered at their deeds and the soul marveleth at their fortitude and bodily endurance or is the testimony of these faithless souls who breathe naught but the breath of selfish desire and who lie imprisoned in the cage of their idle fancies acceptable like the bats of darkness they lift not their heads from their couch except to pursue the transient things of the world and find no rest by night except as they labor to advance the aims of their sordid life immersed in their selfish schemes they are oblivious of the divine decree in the daytime they strive with all their soul after worldly benefits and in the night season their sole occupation is to gratify their carnal desires by what law or standard could men be justified in cleaving to the denials of such petty minded souls and in ignoring the faith of them that have renounced for the sake of the good pleasure of god their life and substance their fame and renown their reputation and honor with what love what devotion what exultation and holy rapture they sacrificed their lives in the path of the all glorious to the truth of this all witness and yet how can they belittle this revelation hath any age witnessed such momentous happenings if these companions be not the true strivers after god who else could be called by this name have these companions been seekers after power or glory have they ever yearned for riches have they cherished any desire except the good pleasure of god if these companions with all their marvelous testimonies and wondrous works be false who then is worthy to claim for himself the truth swear by god their very deeds are sufficient testimony and an irrefutable proof unto all the peoples of the earth were men to ponder in their hearts the mysteries of divine revelation “and they who act unjustly shall soon know what lot awaiteth them ”… consider these martyrs of unquestionable sincerity to whose truthfulness testifieth the explicit text of the book and all of whom as thou hast witnessed have sacrificed their life their substance their wives their children their all and ascended unto the loftiest chambers of paradise is it fair to reject the testimony of these detached and exalted beings to the truth of this preeminent and glorious revelation and to regard as acceptable the denunciations which have been uttered against this resplendent light by this faithless people who for gold have forsaken their faith and who for the sake of leadership have repudiated him who is the first leader of all mankind this although their character is now revealed unto all people who have recognized them as those who will in no wise relinquish one jot or one tittle of their temporal authority for the sake of god’s holy faith how much less their life their substance and the like xcii thebook of god is wide open and his word is summoning mankind unto him no more than mere handful however hath been found willing to cleave to his cause or to become the instruments for its promotion these few have been endued with the divine elixir that can alone transmute into purest gold the dross of the world and have been empowered to administer the infallible remedy for all the ills that afflict the children of men no man can obtain everlasting life unless he embraceth the truth of this inestimable this wondrous and sublime revelation incline your ears friends of god to the voice of him whom the world hath wronged and hold fast unto whatsoever will exalt his cause he verily guideth whomsoever he pleaseth unto his straight path this is revelation that infuseth strength into the feeble and crowneth with wealth the destitute with the utmost friendliness and in spirit of perfect fellowship take ye counsel together and dedicate the precious days of your lives to the betterment of the world and the promotion of the cause of him who is the ancient and sovereign lord of all he verily enjoineth upon all men what is right and forbiddeth whatsoever degradeth their station xciii knowthou that every created thing is sign of the revelation of god each according to its capacity is and will ever remain token of the almighty inasmuch as he the sovereign lord of all hath willed to reveal his sovereignty in the kingdom of names and attributes each and every created thing hath through the act of the divine will been made sign of his glory so pervasive and general is this revelation that nothing whatsoever in the whole universe can be discovered that doth not reflect his splendor under such conditions every consideration of proximity and remoteness is obliterated were the hand of divine power to divest of this high endowment all created things the entire universe would become desolate and void behold how immeasurably exalted is the lord your god above all created things witness the majesty of his sovereignty his ascendancy and supreme power if the things which have been created by him—magnified be his glory—and ordained to be the manifestations of his names and attributes stand by virtue of the grace with which they have been endowed exalted beyond all proximity and remoteness how much loftier must be that divine essence that hath called them into being meditate on what the poet hath written “wonder not if my best beloved be closer to me than mine own self wonder at this that despite such nearness should still be so far from him ”… considering what god hath revealed that “we are closer to man than his life vein the poet hath in allusion to this verse stated that though the revelation of my best beloved hath so permeated my being that he is closer to me than my life vein yet notwithstanding my certitude of its reality and my recognition of my station am still so far removed from him by this he meaneth that his heart which is the seat of the all merciful and the throne wherein abideth the splendor of his revelation is forgetful of its creator hath strayed from his path hath shut out itself from his glory and is stained with the defilement of earthly desires it should be remembered in this connection that the one true god is in himself exalted beyond and above proximity and remoteness his reality transcendeth such limitations his relationship to his creatures knoweth no degrees that some are near and others are far is to be ascribed to the manifestations themselves that the heart is the throne in which the revelation of god the all merciful is centered is attested by the holy utterances which we have formerly revealed among them is this saying “earth and heaven cannot contain me what can alone contain me is the heart of him that believeth in me and is faithful to my cause how often hath the human heart which is the recipient of the light of god and the seat of the revelation of the all merciful erred from him who is the source of that light and the wellspring of that revelation it is the waywardness of the heart that removeth it far from god and condemneth it to remoteness from him those hearts however that are aware of his presence are close to him and are to be regarded as having drawn nigh unto his throne consider moreover how frequently doth man become forgetful of his own self whilst god remaineth through his all encompassing knowledge aware of his creature and continueth to shed upon him the manifest radiance of his glory it is evident therefore that in such circumstances he is closer to him than his own self he will indeed so remain forever for whereas the one true god knoweth all things perceiveth all things and comprehendeth all things mortal man is prone to err and is ignorant of the mysteries that lie enfolded within him let no one imagine that by our assertion that all created things are the signs of the revelation of god is meant that—god forbid—all men be they good or evil pious or infidel are equal in the sight of god nor doth it imply that the divine being—magnified be his name and exalted be his glory—is under any circumstances comparable unto men or can in any way be associated with his creatures such an error hath been committed by certain foolish ones who after having ascended into the heavens of their idle fancies have interpreted divine unity to mean that all created things are the signs of god and that consequently there is no distinction whatsoever between them some have even outstripped them by maintaining that these signs are peers and partners of god himself gracious god he verily is one and indivisible one in his essence one in his attributes everything besides him is as nothing when brought face to face with the resplendent revelation of but one of his names with no more than the faintest intimation of his glory—how much less when confronted with his own self by the righteousness of my name the all merciful the pen of the most high trembleth with great trembling and is sore shaken at the revelation of these words how puny and insignificant is the evanescent drop when compared with the waves and billows of god’s limitless and everlasting ocean and how utterly contemptible must every contingent and perishable thing appear when brought face to face with the uncreated the unspeakable glory of the eternal we implore pardon of god the all powerful for them that entertain such beliefs and give utterance to such words say people how can fleeting fancy compare with the self subsisting and how can the creator be likened unto his creatures who are but as the script of his pen nay his script excelleth all things and is sanctified from and immeasurably exalted above all creatures furthermore consider the signs of the revelation of god in their relation one to another can the sun which is but one of these signs be regarded as equal in rank to darkness the one true god beareth me witness no man can believe it unless he be of those whose hearts are straitened and whose eyes have become deluded say consider your own selves your nails and eyes are both parts of your bodies do ye regard them of equal rank and value if ye say yea say then ye have indeed charged with imposture the lord my god the all glorious inasmuch as ye pare the one and cherish the other as dearly as your own life to transgress the limits of one’s own rank and station is in no wise permissible the integrity of every rank and station must needs be preserved by this is meant that every created thing should be viewed in the light of the station it hath been ordained to occupy it should be borne in mind however that when the light of my name the all pervading hath shed its radiance upon the universe each and every created thing hath according to fixed decree been endowed with the capacity to exercise particular influence and been made to possess distinct virtue consider the effect of poison deadly though it is it possesseth the power of exerting under certain conditions beneficial influence the potency infused into all created things is the direct consequence of the revelation of this most blessed name glorified be he who is the creator of all names and attributes cast into the fire the tree that hath rot and dried up and abide under the shadow of the green and goodly tree and partake of the fruit thereof the people living in the days of the manifestations of god have for the most part uttered such unseemly sayings these have been set down circumstantially in the revealed books and holy scriptures he is really believer in the unity of god who recognizeth in each and every created thing the sign of the revelation of him who is the eternal truth and not he who maintaineth that the creature is indistinguishable from the creator consider for instance the revelation of the light of the name of god the educator behold how in all things the evidences of such revelation are manifest how the betterment of all beings dependeth upon it this education is of two kinds the one is universal its influence pervadeth all things and sustaineth them it is for this reason that god hath assumed the title “lord of all worlds the other is confined to them that have come under the shadow of this name and sought the shelter of this most mighty revelation they however that have failed to seek this shelter have deprived themselves of this privilege and are powerless to benefit from the spiritual sustenance that hath been sent down through the heavenly grace of this most great name how great the gulf fixed between the one and the other if the veil were lifted and the full glory of the station of those that have turned wholly towards god and have in their love for him renounced the world were made manifest the entire creation would be dumbfounded the true believer in the unity of god will as it hath already been explained recognize in the believer and the unbeliever the evidences of the revelation of both of these names were this revelation to be withdrawn all would perish consider in like manner the revelation of the light of the name of god the incomparable behold how this light hath enveloped the entire creation how each and every thing manifesteth the sign of his unity testifieth to the reality of him who is the eternal truth proclaimeth his sovereignty his oneness and his power this revelation is token of his mercy that hath encompassed all created things they that have joined partners with him however are unaware of such revelation and are deprived of the faith through which they can draw near unto and be united with him witness how the divers peoples and kindreds of the earth bear witness to his unity and recognize his oneness but for the sign of the unity of god within them they would have never acknowledged the truth of the words “there is none other god but god and yet consider how grievously they have erred and strayed from his path inasmuch as they have failed to recognize the sovereign revealer they have ceased to be reckoned among those who may be regarded as true believers in the unity of god this sign of the revelation of the divine being in them that have joined partners with him may in sense be regarded as reflection of the glory with which the faithful are illumined none however can comprehend this truth save men endued with understanding they that have truly recognized the unity of god should be regarded as the primary manifestations of this name it is they who have quaffed the wine of divine unity from the cup which the hand of god hath proffered unto them and who have turned their faces towards him how vast the distance that separateth these sanctified beings from those men that are so far away from god god grant that with penetrating vision thou mayest perceive in all things the sign of the revelation of him who is the ancient king and recognize how exalted and sanctified from the whole creation is that most holy and sacred being this in truth is the very root and essence of belief in the unity and singleness of god “god was alone there was none else besides him he now is what he hath ever been there is none other god but him the one the incomparable the almighty the most exalted the most great xciv andnow concerning thy reference to the existence of two gods beware beware lest thou be led to join partners with the lord thy god he is and hath from everlasting been one and alone without peer or equal eternal in the past eternal in the future detached from all things ever abiding unchangeable and self subsisting he hath assigned no associate unto himself in his kingdom no counselor to counsel him none to compare unto him none to rival his glory to this every atom of the universe beareth witness and beyond it the inmates of the realms on high they that occupy the most exalted seats and whose names are remembered before the throne of glory bear thou witness in thine inmost heart unto this testimony which god hath himself and for himself pronounced that there is none other god but him that all else besides him have been created by his behest have been fashioned by his leave are subject to his law are as thing forgotten when compared to the glorious evidences of his oneness and are as nothing when brought face to face with the mighty revelations of his unity he in truth hath throughout eternity been one in his essence one in his attributes one in his works any and every comparison is applicable only to his creatures and all conceptions of association are conceptions that belong solely to those that serve him immeasurably exalted is his essence above the descriptions of his creatures he alone occupieth the seat of transcendent majesty of supreme and inaccessible glory the birds of men’s hearts however high they soar can never hope to attain the heights of his unknowable essence it is he who hath called into being the whole of creation who hath caused every created thing to spring forth at his behest shall then the thing that was born by virtue of the word which his pen hath revealed and which the finger of his will hath directed be regarded as partner with him or an embodiment of his self far be it from his glory that human pen or tongue should hint at his mystery or that human heart conceive his essence all else besides him stand poor and desolate at his door all are powerless before the greatness of his might all are but slaves in his kingdom he is rich enough to dispense with all creatures the tie of servitude established between the worshiper and the adored one between the creature and the creator should in itself be regarded as token of his gracious favor unto men and not as an indication of any merit they may possess to this testifieth every true and discerning believer xcv knowthou that according to what thy lord the lord of all men hath decreed in his book the favors vouchsafed by him unto mankind have been and will ever remain limitless in their range first and foremost among these favors which the almighty hath conferred upon man is the gift of understanding his purpose in conferring such gift is none other except to enable his creature to know and recognize the one true god—exalted be his glory this gift giveth man the power to discern the truth in all things leadeth him to that which is right and helpeth him to discover the secrets of creation next in rank is the power of vision the chief instrument whereby his understanding can function the senses of hearing of the heart and the like are similarly to be reckoned among the gifts with which the human body is endowed immeasurably exalted is the almighty who hath created these powers and revealed them in the body of man every one of these gifts is an undoubted evidence of the majesty the power the ascendancy the all embracing knowledge of the one true god—exalted be his glory consider the sense of touch witness how its power hath spread itself over the entire human body whereas the faculties of sight and of hearing are each localized in particular center the sense of touch embraceth the whole human frame glorified be his power magnified be his sovereignty these gifts are inherent in man himself that which is preeminent above all other gifts is incorruptible in nature and pertaineth to god himself is the gift of divine revelation every bounty conferred by the creator upon man be it material or spiritual is subservient unto this it is in its essence and will ever so remain the bread which cometh down from heaven it is god’s supreme testimony the clearest evidence of his truth the sign of his consummate bounty the token of his all encompassing mercy the proof of his most loving providence the symbol of his most perfect grace he hath indeed partaken of this highest gift of god who hath recognized his manifestation in this day render thanks unto thy lord for having vouchsafed unto thee so great bounty lift up thy voice and say all praise be to thee thou the desire of every understanding heart xcvi thepen of the most high is unceasingly calling and yet how few are those that have inclined their ear to its voice the dwellers of the kingdom of names have busied themselves with the gay livery of the world forgetful that every man that hath eyes to perceive and ears to hear cannot but readily recognize how evanescent are its colors new life is in this age stirring within all the peoples of the earth and yet none hath discovered its cause or perceived its motive consider the peoples of the west witness how in their pursuit of that which is vain and trivial they have sacrificed and are still sacrificing countless lives for the sake of its establishment and promotion the peoples of persia on the other hand though the repository of perspicuous and luminous revelation the glory of whose loftiness and renown hath encompassed the whole earth are dispirited and sunk in deep lethargy friends be not careless of the virtues with which ye have been endowed neither be neglectful of your high destiny suffer not your labors to be wasted through the vain imaginations which certain hearts have devised ye are the stars of the heaven of understanding the breeze that stirreth at the break of day the soft flowing waters upon which must depend the very life of all men the letters inscribed upon his sacred scroll with the utmost unity and in spirit of perfect fellowship exert yourselves that ye may be enabled to achieve that which beseemeth this day of god verily say strife and dissension and whatsoever the mind of man abhorreth are entirely unworthy of his station center your energies in the propagation of the faith of god whoso is worthy of so high calling let him arise and promote it whoso is unable it is his duty to appoint him who will in his stead proclaim this revelation whose power hath caused the foundations of the mightiest structures to quake every mountain to be crushed into dust and every soul to be dumbfounded should the greatness of this day be revealed in its fullness every man would forsake myriad lives in his longing to partake though it be for one moment of its great glory—how much more this world and its corruptible treasures be ye guided by wisdom in all your doings and cleave ye tenaciously unto it please god ye may all be strengthened to carry out that which is the will of god and may be graciously assisted to appreciate the rank conferred upon such of his loved ones as have arisen to serve him and magnify his name upon them be the glory of god the glory of all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth and the glory of the inmates of the most exalted paradise the heaven of heavens xcvii considerthe doubts which they who have joined partners with god have instilled into the hearts of the people of this land “is it ever possible they ask “for gold to be transmuted into copper say yes by my lord it is possible its secret however lieth hidden in our knowledge we will reveal it unto whom we will whoso doubteth our power let him ask the lord his god that he may disclose unto him the secret and assure him of its truth that copper can be turned into gold is in itself sufficient proof that gold can in like manner be transmuted into copper if they be of them that can apprehend this truth every mineral can be made to acquire the density form and substance of each and every other mineral the knowledge thereof is with us in the hidden book xcviii say leaders of religion weigh not the book of god with such standards and sciences as are current amongst you for the book itself is the unerring balance established amongst men in this most perfect balance whatsoever the peoples and kindreds of the earth possess must be weighed while the measure of its weight should be tested according to its own standard did ye but know it the eye of my loving kindness weepeth sore over you inasmuch as ye have failed to recognize the one upon whom ye have been calling in the daytime and in the night season at even and at morn advance people with snow white faces and radiant hearts unto the blest and crimson spot wherein the sadratu’l muntahá is calling “verily there is none other god beside me the omnipotent protector the self subsisting ye leaders of religion who is the man amongst you that can rival me in vision or insight where is he to be found that dareth to claim to be my equal in utterance or wisdom no by my lord the all merciful all on the earth shall pass away and this is the face of your lord the almighty the well beloved we have decreed people that the highest and last end of all learning be the recognition of him who is the object of all knowledge and yet behold how ye have allowed your learning to shut you out as by veil from him who is the dayspring of this light through whom every hidden thing hath been revealed could ye but discover the source whence the splendor of this utterance is diffused ye would cast away the peoples of the world and all that they possess and would draw nigh unto this most blessed seat of glory say this verily is the heaven in which the mother book is treasured could ye but comprehend it he it is who hath caused the rock to shout and the burning bush to lift up its voice upon the mount rising above the holy land and proclaim “the kingdom is god’s the sovereign lord of all the all powerful the loving we have not entered any school nor read any of your dissertations incline your ears to the words of this unlettered one wherewith he summoneth you unto god the ever abiding better is this for you than all the treasures of the earth could ye but comprehend it xcix thevitality of men’s belief in god is dying out in every land nothing short of his wholesome medicine can ever restore it the corrosion of ungodliness is eating into the vitals of human society what else but the elixir of his potent revelation can cleanse and revive it is it within human power ḥakím to effect in the constituent elements of any of the minute and indivisible particles of matter so complete transformation as to transmute it into purest gold perplexing and difficult as this may appear the still greater task of converting satanic strength into heavenly power is one that we have been empowered to accomplish the force capable of such transformation transcendeth the potency of the elixir itself the word of god alone can claim the distinction of being endowed with the capacity required for so great and far reaching change thevoice of the divine herald proceeding out of the throne of god declareth ye my loved ones suffer not the hem of my sacred vesture to be smirched and mired with the things of this world and follow not the promptings of your evil and corrupt desires the daystar of divine revelation that shineth in the plenitude of its glory in the heaven of this prison beareth me witness they whose hearts are turned towards him who is the object of the adoration of the entire creation must needs in this day pass beyond and be sanctified from all created things visible and invisible if they arise to teach my cause they must let the breath of him who is the unconstrained stir them and must spread it abroad on the earth with high resolve with minds that are wholly centered in him and with hearts that are completely detached from and independent of all things and with souls that are sanctified from the world and its vanities it behooveth them to choose as the best provision for their journey reliance upon god and to clothe themselves with the love of their lord the most exalted the all glorious if they do so their words shall influence their hearers how great how very great the gulf that separateth us from them who in this day are occupied with their evil passions and have set their hopes on the things of the earth and its fleeting glory many time hath the court of the all merciful been to outward seeming so denuded of the riches of this world that they who lived in close association with him suffered from dire want despite their sufferings the pen of the most high hath at no time been willing to refer nor even to make the slightest allusion to the things that pertain to this world and its treasures and if at any time any gift were presented to him that gift was accepted as token of his grace unto him that offered it should it ever please us to appropriate to our own use all the treasures of the earth to none is given the right to question our authority or to challenge our right it would be impossible to conceive any act more contemptible than soliciting in the name of the one true god the riches which men possess it is incumbent upon thee and upon the followers of him who is the eternal truth to summon all men to whatsoever shall sanctify them from all attachment to the things of the earth and purge them from its defilements that the sweet smell of the raiment of the all glorious may be smelled from all them that love him they who are possessed of riches however must have the utmost regard for the poor for great is the honor destined by god for those poor who are steadfast in patience by my life there is no honor except what god may please to bestow that can compare to this honor great is the blessedness awaiting the poor that endure patiently and conceal their sufferings and well is it with the rich who bestow their riches on the needy and prefer them before themselves please god the poor may exert themselves and strive to earn the means of livelihood this is duty which in this most great revelation hath been prescribed unto every one and is accounted in the sight of god as goodly deed whoso observeth this duty the help of the invisible one shall most certainly aid him he can enrich through his grace whomsoever he pleaseth he verily hath power over all things tell ‘alí the loved ones of god that equity is the most fundamental among human virtues the evaluation of all things must needs depend upon it ponder awhile on the woes and afflictions which this prisoner hath sustained have all the days of my life been at the mercy of mine enemies and have suffered each day in the path of the love of god fresh tribulation have patiently endured until the fame of the cause of god was spread abroad on the earth if anyone should now arise and prompted by the vain imaginations his heart hath devised endeavor openly or in secret to sow the seeds of dissension amongst men—can such man be said to have acted with equity no by him whose might extendeth over all things by my life mine heart groaneth and mine eyes weep sore for the cause of god and for them that understand not what they say and imagine what they cannot comprehend it beseemeth all men in this day to take firm hold on the most great name and to establish the unity of all mankind there is no place to flee to no refuge that anyone can seek except him should any man be led to utter such words as will turn away the people from the shores of god’s limitless ocean and cause them to fix their hearts on anything except this glorious and manifest being that hath assumed form subject to human limitations—such man however lofty the station he may occupy shall be denounced by the entire creation as one that hath deprived himself of the sweet savors of the all merciful say observe equity in your judgment ye men of understanding heart he that is unjust in his judgment is destitute of the characteristics that distinguish man’s station he who is the eternal truth knoweth well what the breasts of men conceal his long forbearance hath emboldened his creatures for not until the appointed time is come will he rend any veil asunder his surpassing mercy hath restrained the fury of his wrath and caused most people to imagine that the one true god is unaware of the things they have privily committed by him who is the all knowing the all informed the mirror of his knowledge reflecteth with complete distinctness precision and fidelity the doings of all men say praise be to thee concealer of the sins of the weak and helpless magnified be thy name thou that forgivest the heedless ones that trespass against thee we have forbidden men to walk after the imaginations of their hearts that they may be enabled to recognize him who is the sovereign source and object of all knowledge and may acknowledge whatsoever he may be pleased to reveal witness how they have entangled themselves with their idle fancies and vain imaginations by my life they are themselves the victims of what their own hearts have devised and yet they perceive it not vain and profitless is the talk of their lips and yet they understand not we beseech god that he may graciously vouchsafe his grace unto all men and enable them to attain the knowledge of him and of themselves by my life whoso hath known him shall soar in the immensity of his love and shall be detached from the world and all that is therein nothing on earth shall deflect him from his course how much less they who prompted by their vain imaginations speak those things which god hath forbidden say this is the day when every ear must needs be attentive to his voice hearken ye to the call of this wronged one and magnify ye the name of the one true god and adorn yourselves with the ornament of his remembrance and illumine your hearts with the light of his love this is the key that unlocketh the hearts of men the burnish that shall cleanse the souls of all beings he that is careless of what hath poured out from the finger of the will of god liveth in manifest error amity and rectitude of conduct rather than dissension and mischief are the marks of true faith proclaim unto men what he who speaketh the truth and is the bearer of the trust of god hath bidden thee observe my glory be with thee thou that callest upon my name whose eyes are directed towards my court and whose tongue uttereth the praise of thy lord the beneficent ci thepurpose underlying the revelation of every heavenly book nay of every divinely revealed verse is to endue all men with righteousness and understanding so that peace and tranquillity may be firmly established amongst them whatsoever instilleth assurance into the hearts of men whatsoever exalteth their station or promoteth their contentment is acceptable in the sight of god how lofty is the station which man if he but choose to fulfill his high destiny can attain to what depths of degradation he can sink depths which the meanest of creatures have never reached seize friends the chance which this day offereth you and deprive not yourselves of the liberal effusions of his grace beseech god that he may graciously enable every one of you to adorn himself in this blessed day with the ornament of pure and holy deeds he verily doeth whatsoever he willeth cii givea hearing ear people to that which in truth say unto you the one true god exalted be his glory hath ever regarded and will continue to regard the hearts of men as his own his exclusive possession all else whether pertaining to land or sea whether riches or glory he hath bequeathed unto the kings and rulers of the earth from the beginning that hath no beginning the ensign proclaiming the words “he doeth whatsoever he willeth” hath been unfurled in all its splendor before his manifestation what mankind needeth in this day is obedience unto them that are in authority and faithful adherence to the cord of wisdom the instruments which are essential to the immediate protection the security and assurance of the human race have been entrusted to the hands and lie in the grasp of the governors of human society this is the wish of god and his decree we cherish the hope that one of the kings of the earth will for the sake of god arise for the triumph of this wronged this oppressed people such king will be eternally extolled and glorified god hath prescribed unto this people the duty of aiding whosoever will aid them of serving his best interests and of demonstrating to him their abiding loyalty they who follow me must strive under all circumstances to promote the welfare of whosoever will arise for the triumph of my cause and must at all times prove their devotion and fidelity unto him happy is the man that hearkeneth and observeth my counsel woe unto him that faileth to fulfill my wish ciii godhath through his

the fixed and immovable foundation whatsoever is raised on this foundation the changes and chances of the world can never impair its strength nor will the revolution of countless centuries undermine its structure our hope is that the world’s religious leaders and the rulers thereof will unitedly arise for the reformation of this age and the rehabilitation of its fortunes let them after meditating on its needs take counsel together and through anxious and full deliberation administer to diseased and sorely afflicted world the remedy it requireth it is incumbent upon them who are in authority to

draweth you together and uniteth you this verily is the most exalted word which the mother book hath sent down and revealed unto you to this beareth witness the tongue of grandeur from his habitation of glory cxii beholdthe disturbances which for many long year have afflicted the earth and the perturbation that hath seized its peoples it hath either been ravaged by war or tormented by sudden and

rulers and kings of the earth the symbols of the power of god exalted be his glory arise and resolve to dedicate themselves to whatever will promote the highest interests of the whole of humanity the reign of justice will assuredly be established amongst the children of men and the effulgence of its light will envelop the whole earth the great being saith the structure of world stability and order hath been reared upon and will continue to be sustained by the twin pillars of reward and punishment in another passage he hath written take heed concourse of the rulers of the world there is no force on earth that can equal in its conquering power the force of justice and wisdom blessed is the king who marcheth with the ensign of wisdom unfurled before him and the battalions of justice massed in his rear he verily is the ornament that adorneth the brow of peace and the countenance of security there can be no doubt whatever that if the daystar of justice which the clouds of tyranny have obscured were to shed its light upon men the face of the earth would be completely transformed cxiii dostthou imagine minister of thesháh in the city constantinople that hold within my grasp the ultimate destiny of the cause of god thinkest thou that my imprisonment or the shame have been made to suffer or even my death and utter annihilation can deflect its course wretched is what thou hast imagined in thine heart thou art indeed of them that walk after the vain imaginings which their hearts devise no god is there but him powerful is he to manifest his cause and to exalt his testimony and to establish whatsoever is his will and to elevate it to so eminent position that neither thine own hands nor the hands of them that have turned away from him can ever touch or harm it dost thou believe thou hast the power to frustrate his will to hinder him from executing his judgment or to deter him from exercising his sovereignty pretendest thou that aught in the heavens or in the earth can resist his faith no by him who is the eternal truth nothing whatsoever in the whole of creation can thwart his purpose cast away therefore the mere conceit thou dost follow for mere conceit can never take the place of truth be thou of them that have truly repented and returned to god the god who hath created thee who hath nourished thee and made thee minister among them that profess thy faith know thou moreover that he it is who hath by his own behest created all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth how can then the thing that hath been created at his bidding prevail against him high is god exalted above what ye imagine about him ye people of malice if this cause be of god no man can prevail against it and if it be not of god the divines amongst you and they that follow their corrupt desires and such as have rebelled against him will surely suffice to overpower it hast thou not heard what man of the family of pharaoh believer hath said of old and which god recounted unto his apostle whom he hath chosen above all human beings and entrusted with his message and made the source of his mercy unto all them that dwell on earth he said and he verily speaketh the truth “will ye slay man because he saith my lord is god when he hath already come to you with proofs of his mission and if he be liar on him will be his lie but if he be man of truth part at least of what he threateneth will fall upon you this is what god hath revealed unto his well beloved one in his unerring book and yet ye have failed to incline your ears unto his bidding have disregarded his law have rejected his counsel as recorded in his book and have been of them that have strayed far from him how many those who every year and every month have because of you been put to death how manifold the injustices ye have perpetrated—injustices the like of which the eye of creation hath not seen which no chronicler hath ever recorded how numerous the babes and sucklings who were made orphans and the fathers who lost their sons because of your cruelty ye unjust doers how oft hath sister pined away and mourned over her brother and how oft hath wife lamented after her husband and sole sustainer your iniquity waxed greater and greater until ye slew him who had never taken his eyes away from the face of god the most exalted the most great would that ye had put him to death after the manner men are wont to put one another to death ye slew him however in such circumstances as no man hath ever witnessed the heavens wept sore over him and the souls of them who are nigh unto god cried out for his affliction was he not scion of your prophet’s ancient house had not his fame as direct descendant of the apostle been spread abroad amongst you why then did ye inflict upon him what no man however far ye may look back hath inflicted upon another by god the eye of creation hath never beheld your like ye slay him who is scion of your prophet’s house and rejoice and make merry while seated on your seats of honor ye utter your imprecations against them who were before you and who have perpetrated what ye have perpetrated and remain yourselves all the time unaware of your enormities be fair in your judgment did they whom you curse upon whom ye invoke evil act differently from yourselves have they not slain the descendant of their prophet as ye have slain the descendant of your own is not your conduct similar to their conduct wherefore then claim ye to be different from them ye sowers of dissension amongst men and when ye took away his life one of his followers arose to avenge his death he was unknown of men and the design he had conceived was unnoticed by anyone eventually he committed what had been preordained it behooveth you therefore to attach blame to no one except to yourselves for the things ye have committed if ye but judge fairly who is there on the whole earth who hath done what ye have done none by him who is the lord of all worlds all the rulers and kings of the earth honor and revere the descendants of their prophets and holy men could ye but perceive it ye on the other hand are responsible for such acts as no man hath at any time performed your misdeeds have caused every understanding heart to be consumed with grief and yet ye have remained sunk in your heedlessness and failed to realize the wickedness of your actions ye have persisted in your waywardness until ye rose up against us though we had committed nothing to justify your enmity fear ye not god who hath created you and fashioned you and caused you to attain your strength and joined you with them that have resigned themselves to him muslims how long will ye persist in your waywardness how long will ye refuse to reflect how long ere ye shake off your slumber and are roused from your heedlessness how long will ye remain unaware of the truth ponder in thine heart did ye notwithstanding your behavior and the things your hands have wrought succeed in quenching the fire of god or in putting out the light of his revelation—a light that hath enveloped with its brightness them that are immersed in the billowing oceans of immortality and hath attracted the souls of such as truly believe in and uphold his unity know ye not that the hand of god is over your hands that his irrevocable decree transcendeth all your devices that he is supreme over his servants that he is equal to his purpose that he doth what he wisheth that he shall not be asked of whatever he willeth that he ordaineth what he pleaseth that he is the most powerful the almighty if ye believe this to be the truth wherefore then will ye not cease from troubling and be at peace with yourselves ye perpetrate every day fresh injustice and treat me as ye treated me in times past though never attempted to meddle with your affairs at no time have opposed you neither have rebelled against your laws behold how ye have at the last made me prisoner in this far off land know for certainty however that whatever your hands or the hands of the infidels have wrought will never as they never did of old change the cause of god or alter his ways give heed to my warning ye people of persia if be slain at your hands god will assuredly raise up one who will fill the seat made vacant through my death for such is god’s method carried into effect of old and no change can ye find in god’s method of dealing seek ye to put out god’s light that shineth upon his earth averse is god from what ye desire he shall perfect his light albeit ye abhor it in the secret of your hearts pause for but little while and reflect minister and be fair in thy judgment what is it that we have committed that could justify thee in having slandered us unto the king’s ministers in following thy desires in perverting the truth and in uttering thy calumnies against us we have never met each other except when we met thee in thy father’s house in the days when the martyrdom of imám ḥusayn was being commemorated on those occasions no one could have the chance of making known to others his views and beliefs in conversation or in discourse thou wilt bear witness to the truth of my words if thou be of the truthful have frequented no other gatherings in which thou couldst have learned my mind or in which any other could have done so how then didst thou pronounce thy verdict against me when thou hadst not heard my testimony from mine own lips hast thou not heard what god exalted be his glory hath said “say not to every one who meeteth you with greeting ‘thou art not believer’ “thrust not away those who cry to their lord at morn and even craving to behold his face thou hast indeed forsaken what the book of god hath prescribed and yet thou deemest thyself to be believer despite what thou hast done entertain—and to this god is my witness—no ill will against thee nor against anyone though from thee and others we receive such hurt as no believer in the unity of god can sustain my cause is in the hand of none except god and my trust is in no one else but him erelong shall your days pass away as shall pass away the days of those who now with flagrant pride vaunt themselves over their neighbor soon shall ye be gathered together in the presence of god and shall be asked of your doings and shall be repaid for what your hands have wrought and wretched the abode of the wicked doers by god wert thou to realize what thou hast done thou wouldst surely weep sore over thyself and wouldst flee for refuge to god and wouldst pine away and mourn all the days of thy life till god will have forgiven thee for he verily is the most generous the all bountiful thou wilt however persist till the hour of thy death in thy heedlessness inasmuch as thou hast with all thine heart thy soul and inmost being busied thyself with the vanities of the world thou shalt after thy departure discover what we have revealed unto thee and shalt find all thy doings recorded in the book wherein the works of all them that dwell on earth be they greater or less than the weight of an atom are noted down heed therefore my counsel and hearken thou with the hearing of thine heart unto my speech and be not careless of my words nor be of them that reject my truth glory not in the things that have been given thee set before thine eyes what hath been revealed in the book of god the help in peril the all glorious “and when they had forgotten their warnings we set open to them the gates of all things even as we did set open to thee and to thy like the gates of this earth and the ornaments thereof wait thou therefore for what hath been promised in the latter part of this holy verse for this is promise from him who is the almighty the all wise—a promise that will not prove untrue know not the path ye have chosen and which ye tread congregation of my ill wishers we summon you to god we remind you of his day we announce unto you tidings of your reunion with him we draw you nigh unto his court and send down upon you tokens of his wondrous wisdom and yet lo behold how ye reject us how ye condemn us through the things which your lying mouths have uttered as an infidel how ye devise your devices against us and when we manifest unto you what god hath through his bountiful favor bestowed upon us ye say “it is but plain magic the same words were spoken by the generations that were before you and were what you are did ye but perceive it ye have thereby deprived yourselves of the bounty of god and of his grace and shall never obtain them till the day when god will have judged between us and you and he verily is the best of judges certain ones among you have said “he it is who hath laid claim to be god by god this is gross calumny am but servant of god who hath believed in him and in his signs and in his prophets and in his angels my tongue and my heart and my inner and my outer being testify that there is no god but him that all others have been created by his behest and been fashioned through the operation of his will there is none other god but him the creator the raiser from the dead the quickener the slayer am he that telleth abroad the favors with which god hath through his bounty favored me if this be my transgression then am truly the first of the transgressors and my kindred are at your mercy do ye as ye please and be not of them that hesitate that might return to god my lord and reach the place where can no longer behold your faces this indeed is my dearest wish my most ardent desire of my state god is verily sufficiently informed observant imagine thyself to be under the eye of god minister if thou seest him not he in truth clearly seeth thee observe and judge fairly our cause what is it that we have committed that could have induced thee to rise up against us and to slander us to the people if thou be of them who are just we departed out of ṭihrán at the bidding of the king and by his leave transferred our residence to ‘iráq if had transgressed against him why then did he release me and if were innocent of guilt wherefore did ye afflict us with such tribulation as none among them that profess your faith hath suffered hath any of mine acts after mine arrival in ‘iráq been such as to subvert the authority of the government who is it that can be said to have detected any thing reprehensible in our behavior enquire for thyself of its people that thou mayest be of them who have discerned the truth for eleven years we dwelt in that land until the minister representing thy government arrived whose name our pen is loath to mention who was given to wine who followed his lusts and committed wickedness and was corrupt and corrupted ‘iráq to this will bear witness most of the inhabitants of baghdád wert thou to inquire of them and be of such as seek the truth he it was who wrongfully seized the substance of his fellowmen who forsook all the commandments of god and perpetrated whatever god had forbidden eventually he following his desires rose up against us and walked in the ways of the unjust he accused us in his letter to thee and thou didst believe him and followed in his way without seeking any proof or trustworthy evidence from him thou didst ask for no explanation nor didst thou attempt either to investigate or ascertain the matter that the truth might be distinguished from falsehood in thy sight and that thou mightest be clear in thy discernment find out for thyself the sort of man he was by asking those ministers who were at that time in ‘iráq as well as the governor of the city baghdád and its high counselor that the truth may be revealed to thee and that thou mayest be of the well informed god is our witness we have under no circumstances opposed either him or others we observed under all conditions the precepts of god and were never one of those that wrought disorders to this he himself doth testify his intention was to lay hold on us and send us back to persia that he might thereby exalt his fame and reputation thou hast committed the same crime and for the self same purpose ye both are of equal grade in the sight of god the sovereign lord of all the all knowing it is not our purpose in addressing to thee these words to lighten the burden of our woe or to induce thee to intercede for us with anyone no by him who is the lord of all worlds we have set forth the whole matter before thee that perchance thou might realize what thou hast done might desist from inflicting on others the hurt thou hast inflicted on us and might be of them that have truly repented to god who created thee and created all things and might act with discernment in the future better is this for thee than all thou dost possess than thy ministry whose days are numbered beware lest thou be led to connive at injustice set thy heart firmly upon justice and alter not the cause of god and be of them whose eyes are directed towards the things that have been revealed in his book follow not under any condition the promptings of thine evil desires keep thou the law of god thy lord the beneficent the ancient of days thou shalt most certainly return to dust and shalt perish like all the things in which thou takest delight this is what the tongue of truth and glory hath spoken rememberest thou not god’s warning uttered in times past that thou mayest be of them that heed his warning he said and he verily speaketh the truth “from it earth have we created you and unto it will we return you and out of it will we bring you forth second time this is what god ordained unto all them that dwell on earth be they high or low it behooveth not therefore him who was created from dust who will return unto it and will again be brought forth out of it to swell with pride before god and before his loved ones to proudly scorn them and be filled with disdainful arrogance nay rather it behooveth thee and those like thee to submit yourselves to them who are the manifestations of the unity of god and to defer humbly to the faithful who have forsaken their all for the sake of god and have detached themselves from the things which engross men’s attention and lead them astray from the path of god the all glorious the all praised thus do we send down upon you that which shall profit you and profit them that have placed their whole trust and confidence in their lord cxiv hearken king sulṭán ‘abdu’l ‘azíz to the speech of him that speaketh the truth him that doth not ask thee to recompense him with the things god hath chosen to bestow upon thee him who unerringly treadeth the straight path he it is who summoneth thee unto god thy lord who showeth thee the right course the way that leadeth to true felicity that haply thou mayest be of them with whom it shall be well beware king that thou gather not around thee such ministers as follow the desires of corrupt inclination as have cast behind their backs that which hath been committed into their hands and manifestly betrayed their trust be bounteous to others as god hath been bounteous to thee and abandon not the interests of thy people to the mercy of such ministers as these lay not aside the fear of god and be thou of them that act uprightly gather around thee those ministers from whom thou canst perceive the fragrance of faith and of justice and take thou counsel with them and choose whatever is best in thy sight and be of them that act generously know thou for certainty that whoso disbelieveth in god is neither trustworthy nor truthful this indeed is the truth the undoubted truth he that acteth treacherously towards god will also act treacherously towards his king nothing whatever can deter such man from evil nothing can hinder him from betraying his neighbor nothing can induce him to walk uprightly take heed that thou resign not the reins of the affairs of thy state into the hands of others and repose not thy confidence in ministers unworthy of thy trust and be not of them that live in heedlessness shun them whose hearts are turned away from thee and place not thy confidence in them and entrust them not with thine affairs and the affairs of such as profess thy faith beware that thou allow not the wolf to become the shepherd of god’s flock and surrender not the fate of his loved ones to the mercy of the malicious expect not that they who violate the ordinances of god will be trustworthy or sincere in the faith they profess avoid them and preserve strict guard over thyself lest their devices and mischief hurt thee turn away from them and fix thy gaze upon god thy lord the all glorious the most bountiful he that giveth up himself wholly to god god shall assuredly be with him and he that placeth his complete trust in god god shall verily protect him from whatsoever may harm him and shield him from the wickedness of every evil plotter wert thou to incline thine ear unto my speech and observe my counsel god would exalt thee to so eminent position that the designs of no man on the whole earth can ever touch or hurt thee observe king with thine inmost heart and with thy whole being the precepts of god and walk not in the paths of the oppressor seize thou and hold firmly within the grasp of thy might the reins of the affairs of thy people and examine in person whatever pertaineth unto them let nothing escape thee for therein lieth the highest good render thanks unto god for having chosen thee out of the whole world and made thee king over them that profess thy faith it well beseemeth thee to appreciate the wondrous favors with which god hath favored thee and to magnify continually his name thou canst best praise him if thou lovest his loved ones and dost safeguard and protect his servants from the mischief of the treacherous that none may any longer oppress them thou shouldst moreover arise to enforce the law of god amongst them that thou mayest be of those who are firmly established in his law shouldst thou cause rivers of justice to spread their waters amongst thy subjects god would surely aid thee with the hosts of the unseen and of the seen and would strengthen thee in thine affairs no god is there but him all creation and its empire are his unto him return the works of the faithful place not thy reliance on thy treasures put thy whole confidence in the grace of god thy lord let him be thy trust in whatever thou doest and be of them that have submitted themselves to his will let him be thy helper and enrich thyself with his treasures for with him are the treasuries of the heavens and of the earth he bestoweth them upon whom he will and from whom he will he withholdeth them there is none other god but him the all possessing the all praised all are but paupers at the door of his mercy all are helpless before the revelation of his sovereignty and beseech his favors overstep not the bounds of moderation and deal justly with them that serve thee bestow upon them according to their needs and not to the extent that will enable them to lay up riches for themselves to deck their persons to embellish their homes to acquire the things that are of no benefit unto them and to be numbered with the extravagant deal with them with undeviating justice so that none among them may either suffer want or be pampered with luxuries this is but manifest justice allow not the abject to rule over and dominate them who are noble and worthy of honor and suffer not the high minded to be at the mercy of the contemptible and worthless for this is what we observed upon our arrival in the city constantinople and to it we bear witness we found among its inhabitants some who were possessed of an affluent fortune and lived in the midst of excessive riches while others were in dire want and abject poverty this ill beseemeth thy sovereignty and is unworthy of thy rank let my counsel be acceptable to thee and strive thou to rule with equity among men that god may exalt thy name and spread abroad the fame of thy justice in all the world beware lest thou aggrandize thy ministers at the expense of thy subjects fear the sighs of the poor and of the upright in heart who at every break of day bewail their plight and be unto them benignant sovereign they verily are thy treasures on earth it behooveth thee therefore to safeguard thy treasures from the assaults of them who wish to rob thee inquire into their affairs and ascertain every year nay every month their condition and be not of them that are careless of their duty set before thine eyes god’s unerring balance and as one standing in his presence weigh in that balance thine actions every day every moment of thy life bring thyself to account ere thou art summoned to reckoning on the day when no man shall have strength to stand for fear of god the day when the hearts of the heedless ones shall be made to tremble it behooveth every king to be as bountiful as the sun which fostereth the growth of all beings and giveth to each its due whose benefits are not inherent in itself but are ordained by him who is the most powerful the almighty the king should be as generous as liberal in his mercy as the clouds the outpourings of whose bounty are showered upon every land by the behest of him who is the supreme ordainer the all knowing have care not to entrust thine affairs of state entirely into another’s hands none can discharge thy functions better than thine own self thus do we make clear unto thee our words of wisdom and send down upon thee that which can enable thee to pass over from the left hand of oppression to the right hand of justice and approach the resplendent ocean of his favors such is the path which the kings that were before thee have trodden they that acted equitably towards their subjects and walked in the ways of undeviating justice thou art god’s shadow on earth strive therefore to act in such manner as befitteth so eminent so august station if thou dost depart from following the things we have caused to descend upon thee and taught thee thou wilt assuredly be derogating from that great and priceless honor return then and cleave wholly unto god and cleanse thine heart from the world and all its vanities and suffer not the love of any stranger to enter and dwell therein not until thou dost purify thine heart from every trace of such love can the brightness of the light of god shed its radiance upon it for to none hath god given more than one heart this verily hath been decreed and written down in his ancient book and as the human heart as fashioned by god is one and undivided it behooveth thee to take heed that its affections be also one and undivided cleave thou therefore with the whole affection of thine heart unto his love and withdraw it from the love of anyone besides him that he may aid thee to immerse thyself in the ocean of his unity and enable thee to become true upholder of his oneness god is my witness my sole purpose in revealing to thee these words is to sanctify thee from the transitory things of the earth and aid thee to enter the realm of everlasting glory that thou mayest by the leave of god be of them that abide and rule therein swear by god king it is not my wish to make my plaint to thee against them that persecute me only plead my grief and my sorrow to god who hath created me and them who well knoweth our state and who watcheth over all things my wish is to warn them of the consequences of their actions if perchance they might desist from treating others as they have treated me and be of them that heed my warning the tribulations that have touched us the destitution from which we suffer the various troubles with which we are encompassed shall all pass away as shall pass away the pleasures in which they delight and the affluence they enjoy this is the truth which no man on earth can reject the days in which we have been compelled to dwell in the dust will soon be ended as will the days in which they occupied the seats of honor god shall assuredly judge with truth between us and them and he verily is the best of judges we render thanks unto god for whatsoever hath befallen us and we patiently endure the things he hath ordained in the past or will ordain in the future in him have placed my trust and into his hands have committed my cause he will certainly repay all them that endure with patience and put their confidence in him his is the creation and its empire he exalteth whom he will and whom he will he doth abase he shall not be asked of his doings he verily is the all glorious the almighty let thine ear be attentive king to the words we have addressed to thee let the oppressor desist from his tyranny and cut off the perpetrators of injustice from among them that profess thy faith by the righteousness of god the tribulations we have sustained are such that any pen that recounteth them cannot but be overwhelmed with anguish no one of them that truly believe and uphold the unity of god can bear the burden of their recital so great have been our sufferings that even the eyes of our enemies have wept over us and beyond them those of every discerning person and to all these trials have we been subjected in spite of our action in approaching thee and in bidding the people to enter beneath thy shadow that thou mightest be stronghold unto them that believe in and uphold the unity of god have king ever disobeyed thee have at any time transgressed any of thy laws can any of thy ministers that represented thee in ‘iráq produce any proof that can establish my disloyalty to thee no by him who is the lord of all worlds not for one short moment did we rebel against thee or against any of thy ministers never god willing shall we revolt against thee though we be exposed to trials more severe than any we suffered in the past in the day time and in the night season at even and at morn we pray to god on thy behalf that he may graciously aid thee to be obedient unto him and to observe his commandment that he may shield thee from the hosts of the evil ones do therefore as it pleaseth thee and treat us as befitteth thy station and beseemeth thy sovereignty be not forgetful of the law of god in whatever thou desirest to achieve now or in the days to come say praise be to god the lord of all worlds cxv thepen of revelation odhabíḥ hath in most of the divinely revealed tablets recorded these words we have admonished all the loved ones of god to take heed lest the hem of our sacred vesture be smirched with the mire of unlawful deeds or be stained with the dust of reprehensible conduct we have moreover exhorted them to fix their gaze upon whatsoever hath been revealed in our tablets had their inner ears been attentive to the divine counsels which have shone forth from the dayspring of the pen of the all merciful and hearkened unto his voice most of the peoples of the earth would have by now been adorned with the ornament of his guidance what had been preordained however hath come to pass once again doth the tongue of the ancient of days reveal while in this most great prison these words which are recorded in this snow white scroll ye the beloved of the one true god pass beyond the narrow retreats of your evil and corrupt desires and advance into the vast immensity of the realm of god and abide ye in the meads of sanctity and of detachment that the fragrance of your deeds may lead the whole of mankind to the ocean of god’s unfading glory forbear ye from concerning yourselves with the affairs of this world and all that pertaineth unto it or from meddling with the activities of those who are its outward leaders the one true god exalted be his glory hath bestowed the government of the earth upon the kings to none is given the right to act in any manner that would run counter to the considered views of them who are in authority that which he hath reserved for himself are the cities of men’s hearts and of these the loved ones of him who is the sovereign truth are in this day as the keys please god they may one and all be enabled to unlock through the power of the most great name the gates of these cities this is what is meant by aiding the one true god—a theme to which the pen of him who causeth the dawn to break hath referred in all his books and tablets it behooveth likewise the loved ones of god to be forbearing towards their fellowmen and to be so sanctified and detached from all things and to evince such sincerity and fairness that all the peoples of the earth may recognize them as the trustees of god amongst men consider to what lofty heights the injunctions of the almighty have soared and how abject is the habitation wherein these feeble souls are now abiding blessed are they who on the wings of certitude have flown in the heavens which the pen of thy lord the all merciful hath spread behold odhabíḥ the works which god the sovereign truth hath wrought say thou how great how very great is the power of his might that encompasseth all worlds exalted immeasurably exalted is his detachment above the reach and ken of the entire creation glorified glorified be his meekness—a meekness that hath melted the hearts of them that have been brought nigh unto god though afflicted with countless tribulations which we have suffered at the hands of our enemies we have proclaimed unto all the rulers of the earth what god hath willed to proclaim that all nations may know that no manner of affliction can deter the pen of the ancient of days from achieving its purpose his pen moveth by the leave of god who fashioneth the crumbling and rotten bones considering this most mighty enterprise it beseemeth them that love him to gird up the loins of their endeavor and to fix their thoughts on whatever will ensure the victory of the cause of god rather than commit vile and contemptible deeds wert thou to consider for but little while the outward works and doings of him who is the eternal truth thou wouldst fall down upon the ground and exclaim thou who art the lord of lords testify that thou art the lord of all creation and the educator of all beings visible and invisible bear witness that thy power hath encompassed the entire universe and that the hosts of the earth can never dismay thee nor can the dominion of all peoples and nations deter thee from executing thy purpose confess that thou hast no desire except the regeneration of the whole world and the establishment of the unity of its peoples and the salvation of all them that dwell therein reflect awhile and consider how they who are the loved ones of god must conduct themselves and to what heights they must soar beseech thou at all times thy lord the god of mercy to aid them to do what he willeth he verily is the most powerful the all glorious the all knowing the imprisonment inflicted on this wronged one odhabíḥ did to him no harm nor can it ever do so nor can the loss of all his earthly goods his exile or even his martyrdom and outward humiliation do him any hurt that which can hurt him are the evil deeds which the beloved of god commit and which they impute to him who is the sovereign truth this is the affliction from which suffer and to this he himself who is potent over all things beareth me witness that which hath sorely hurt me are the claims which the people of the bayán are advancing every day some have proclaimed their allegiance to one of my branches sons while others have asserted independently their claims and acted after their own desires odhabíḥ the tongue of grandeur saith by myself that speaketh the truth in this most mighty revelation all the dispensations of the past have attained their highest and final consummation whoso layeth claim to revelation after him such man is assuredly lying impostor we pray god that he may graciously assist him to retract and repudiate such claim should he repent god will no doubt forgive him if however he persisteth in his error god will assuredly send down one who will deal mercilessly with him he verily is the almighty the most powerful behold how the people of the bayán have utterly failed to recognize that the sole object of whatsoever my previous manifestation and harbinger of my beauty hath revealed hath been my revelation and the proclamation of my cause never—and to this he who is the sovereign truth beareth me witness—would he have but for me pronounced what he did pronounce witness how this foolish people have treated the cause of him who is the all possessing the inaccessible as play and pastime their hearts devise each day new device and their fancy leadeth them to seek fresh retreat if what they say be true how then can the stability of the cause of thy lord be ensured ponder this in thine heart and be thou of them who are sharp sighted who scan heedfully who are steadfast in their purpose and confident in their belief such should be thy certitude that if all mankind were to advance such claims as no man hath ever advanced or any mind conceived thou wouldst completely ignore them wouldst cast them from thee and would set thy face towards him who is the object of the adoration of all worlds by the righteousness of mine own self great immeasurably great is this cause mighty inconceivably mighty is this day blessed indeed is the man that hath forsaken all things and fastened his eyes upon him whose face hath shed illumination upon all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth sharp must be thy sight odhabíḥ and adamant thy soul and brass like thy feet if thou wishest to be unshaken by the assaults of the selfish desires that whisper in men’s breasts this is the firm injunction which the pen of the most great name hath by virtue of the will of the ancient king been moved to reveal keep it as the apple of thine eye and be thou of the thankful strive thou day and night to serve the cause of him who is the eternal truth and be thou detached from all else but him by myself whatever thou seest in this day shall perish supremely lofty will be thy station if thou remainest steadfast in the cause of thy lord towards him are thy busy movements directed and in him is thy final resting place cxvi kingsof christendom heard ye not the saying of jesus the spirit of god “i go away and come again unto you” wherefore then did ye fail when he did come again unto you in the clouds of heaven to draw nigh unto him that ye might behold his face and be of them that attained his presence in another passage he saith “when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth and yet behold how when he did bring the truth ye refused to turn your faces towards him and persisted in disporting yourselves with your pastimes and fancies ye welcomed him not neither did ye seek his presence that ye might hear the verses of god from his own mouth and partake of the manifold wisdom of the almighty the all glorious the all wise ye have by reason of your failure hindered the breath of god from being wafted over you and have withheld from your souls the sweetness of its fragrance ye continue roving with delight in the valley of your corrupt desires ye and all ye possess shall pass away ye shall most certainly return to god and shall be called to account for your doings in the presence of him who shall gather together the entire creation twenty years have passed kings during which we have each day tasted the agony of fresh tribulation no one of them that were before us hath endured the things we have endured would that ye could perceive it they that rose up against us have put us to death have shed our blood have plundered our property and violated our honor though aware of most of our afflictions ye nevertheless have failed to stay the hand of the aggressor for is it not your clear duty to restrain the tyranny of the oppressor and to deal equitably with your subjects that your high sense of justice may be fully demonstrated to all mankind god hath committed into your hands the reins of the government of the people that ye may rule with justice over them safeguard the rights of the downtrodden and punish the wrongdoers if ye neglect the duty prescribed unto you by god in his book your names shall be numbered with those of the unjust in his sight grievous indeed will be your error cleave ye to that which your imaginations have devised and cast behind your backs the commandments of god the most exalted the inaccessible the all compelling the almighty cast away the things ye possess and cling to that which god hath bidden you observe seek ye his grace for he that seeketh it treadeth his straight path consider the state in which we are and behold ye the ills and troubles that have tried us neglect us not though it be for moment and judge ye between us and our enemies with equity this will surely be manifest advantage unto you thus do we relate to you our tale and recount the things that have befallen us that ye might take off our ills and ease our burden let him who will relieve us from our trouble and as to him that willeth not my lord is assuredly the best of helpers warn and acquaint the people servant with the things we have sent down unto thee and let the fear of no one dismay thee and be thou not of them that waver the day is approaching when god will have exalted his cause and magnified his testimony in the eyes of all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth place in all circumstances thy whole trust in thy lord and fix thy gaze upon him and turn away from all them that repudiate his truth let god thy lord be thy sufficing succorer and helper we have pledged ourselves to secure thy triumph upon earth and to exalt our cause above all men though no king be found who would turn his face towards thee cxvii thegreat being wishing to reveal the prerequisites of the peace and tranquillity of the world and the advancement of its peoples hath written the time must come when the imperative necessity for the holding of vast an all embracing assemblage of men will be universally realized the rulers and kings of the earth must needs attend it and participating in its deliberations must consider such ways and means as will lay the foundations of the world’s great peace amongst men such peace demandeth that the great powers should resolve for the sake of the tranquillity of the peoples of the earth to be fully reconciled among themselves should any king take up arms against another all should unitedly arise and prevent him if this be done the nations of the world will no longer require any armaments except for the purpose of preserving the security of their realms and of maintaining internal order within their territories this will ensure the peace and composure of every people government and nation we fain would hope that the kings and rulers of the earth the mirrors of the gracious and almighty name of god may attain unto this station and shield mankind from the onslaught of tyranny the day is approaching when all the peoples of the world will have adopted one universal language and one common script when this is achieved to whatsoever city man may journey it shall be as if he were entering his own home these things are obligatory and absolutely essential it is incumbent upon every man of insight and understanding to strive to translate that which hath been written into reality and action that one indeed is man who today dedicateth himself to the service of the entire human race the great being saith blessed and happy is he that ariseth to promote the best interests of the peoples and kindreds of the earth in another passage he hath proclaimed it is not for him to pride himself who loveth his own country but rather for him who loveth the whole world the earth is but one country and mankind its citizens cxviii laynot aside the fear of god kings of the earth and beware that ye transgress not the bounds which the almighty hath fixed observe the injunctions laid upon you in his book and take good heed not to overstep their limits be vigilant that ye may not do injustice to anyone be it to the extent of grain of mustard seed tread ye the path of justice for this verily is the straight path compose your differences and reduce your armaments that the burden of your expenditures may be lightened and that your minds and hearts may be tranquillized heal the dissensions that divide you and ye will no longer be in need of any armaments except what the protection of your cities and territories demandeth fear ye god and take heed not to outstrip the bounds of moderation and be numbered among the extravagant we have learned that you are increasing your outlay every year and are laying the burden thereof on your subjects this verily is more than they can bear and is grievous injustice decide justly between men and be ye the emblems of justice amongst them this if ye judge fairly is the thing that behooveth you and beseemeth your station beware not to deal unjustly with anyone that appealeth to you and entereth beneath your shadow walk ye in the fear of god and be ye of them that lead godly life rest not on your power your armies and treasures put your whole trust and confidence in god who hath created you and seek ye his help in all your affairs succor cometh from him alone he succoreth whom he will with the hosts of the heavens and of the earth know ye that the poor are the trust of god in your midst watch that ye betray not his trust that ye deal not unjustly with them and that ye walk not in the ways of the treacherous ye will most certainly be called upon to answer for his trust on the day when the balance of justice shall be set the day when unto every one shall be rendered his due when the doings of all men be they rich or poor shall be weighed if ye pay no heed unto the counsels which in peerless and unequivocal language we have revealed in this tablet divine chastisement shall assail you from every direction and the sentence of his justice shall be pronounced against you on that day ye shall have no power to resist him and shall recognize your own impotence have mercy on yourselves and on those beneath you judge ye between them according to the precepts prescribed by god in his most holy and exalted tablet tablet wherein he hath assigned to each and every thing its settled measure in which he hath given with distinctness an explanation of all things and which is in itself monition unto them that believe in him examine our cause inquire into the things that have befallen us and decide justly between us and our enemies and be ye of them that act equitably towards their neighbor if ye stay not the hand of the oppressor if ye fail to safeguard the rights of the downtrodden what right have ye then to vaunt yourselves among men what is it of which ye can rightly boast is it on your food and your drink that ye pride yourselves on the riches ye lay up in your treasuries on the diversity and the cost of the ornaments with which ye deck yourselves if true glory were to consist in the possession of such perishable things then the earth on which ye walk must needs vaunt itself over you because it supplieth you and bestoweth upon you these very things by the decree of the almighty in its bowels are contained according to what god hath ordained all that ye possess from it as sign of his mercy ye derive your riches behold then your state the thing in which ye glory would that ye could perceive it nay by him who holdeth in his grasp the kingdom of the entire creation nowhere doth your true and abiding glory reside except in your firm adherence unto the precepts of god your wholehearted observance of his laws your resolution to see that they do not remain unenforced and to pursue steadfastly the right course cxix yerulers of the earth wherefore have ye clouded the radiance of the sun and caused it to cease from shining hearken unto the counsel given you by the pen of the most high that haply both ye and the poor may attain unto tranquillity and peace we beseech god to assist the kings of the earth to establish peace on earth he verily doth what he willeth kings of the earth we see you increasing every year your expenditures and laying the burden thereof on your subjects this verily is wholly and grossly unjust fear the sighs and tears of this wronged one and lay not excessive burdens on your peoples do not rob them to rear palaces for yourselves nay rather choose for them that which ye choose for yourselves thus we unfold to your eyes that which profiteth you if ye but perceive your people are your treasures beware lest your rule violate the commandments of god and ye deliver your wards to the hands of the robber by them ye rule by their means ye subsist by their aid ye conquer yet how disdainfully ye look upon them how strange how very strange now that ye have refused the most great peace hold ye fast unto this the lesser peace that haply ye may in some degree better your own condition and that of your dependents rulers of the earth be reconciled among yourselves that ye may need no more armaments save in measure to safeguard your territories and dominions beware lest ye disregard the counsel of the all knowing the faithful be united kings of the earth for thereby will the tempest of discord be stilled amongst you and your peoples find rest if ye be of them that comprehend should anyone among you take up arms against another rise ye all against him for this is naught but manifest justice cxx yethe elected representatives of the people in every land take ye counsel together and let your concern be only for that which profiteth mankind and bettereth the condition thereof if ye be of them that scan heedfully regard the world as the human body which though at its creation whole and perfect hath been afflicted through various causes with grave disorders and maladies not for one day did it gain ease nay its sickness waxed more severe as it fell under the treatment of ignorant physicians who gave full rein to their personal desires and have erred grievously and if at one time through the care of an able physician member of that body was healed the rest remained afflicted as before thus informeth you the all knowing the all wise we behold it in this day at the mercy of rulers so drunk with pride that they cannot discern clearly their own best advantage much less recognize revelation so bewildering and challenging as this and whenever any one of them hath striven to improve its condition his motive hath been his own gain whether confessedly so or not and the unworthiness of this motive hath limited his power to heal or cure that which the lord hath ordained as the sovereign remedy and mightiest instrument for the healing of all the world is the union of all its peoples in one universal cause one common faith this can in no wise be achieved except through the power of skilled an all powerful and inspired physician this verily is the truth and all else naught but error cxxi say ye that envy me and seek my hurt the fury of your wrath against me confound you lo the daystar of glory hath risen above the horizon of my revelation and enveloped with its radiance the whole of mankind and yet behold how ye have shut out yourselves from its splendor and are sunk in utter heedlessness have mercy upon yourselves and repudiate not the claim of him whose truth ye have already recognized and be not of them that transgress by the righteousness of the one true god if ye reject this revelation all the nations of the earth will laugh you to scorn and mock you for it is you that have produced before their eyes and for the purpose of vindicating the truth of your cause the testimonies of god the sovereign protector the most powerful the all glorious the all knowing and yet no sooner was his subsequent revelation clothed with the glory of an all compelling sovereignty sent down unto you than ye cast it behind your backs ye that are numbered with the heedless ones what believe ye in your hearts that ye possess the power to extinguish the radiance of the sun or to eclipse its splendor nay by my life ye will never and can never achieve your purpose though ye summon to your aid all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth walk ye in the fear of god and render not your works vain incline your ears to his words and be not of them that are shut out as by veil from him say god is my witness have wished nothing whatever for myself what have wished is the victory of god and the triumph of his cause he is himself sufficient witness between you and me were ye to cleanse your eyes ye would readily perceive how my deeds testify to the truth of my words how my words are guide to my deeds blinded are your eyes perceived ye not the greatness of the power of god and of his sovereignty beheld ye not his majesty and glory woe unto you ye congregation of the malicious and envious hearken unto my speech and tarry not though it be for less than moment thus biddeth you he who is the beauty of the all merciful that haply ye may detach yourselves from the things ye possess and ascend to the heights from which ye can discover the whole creation sheltered beneath the shadow of his revelation say there is no place of refuge for you no asylum to which ye can flee no one to defend or to protect you in this day from the fury of the wrath of god and from his vehement power unless and until ye seek the shadow of his revelation this indeed is his revelation which hath been manifested unto you in the person of this youth glorified then be god for so effulgent so precious so wondrous vision detach yourselves from all else but me and turn your faces towards my face for better is this for you than the things ye possess the tongue of god testifieth to the truth of my words through mine own word that speaketh the truth and embraceth and comprehendeth all things say think ye that your allegiance to his cause can ever profit him or your repudiation of its truth cause him any loss no by my self the all subduing the inaccessible the most high tear ye asunder the veils of names and cleave ye their kingdom by my beauty he who is the monarch of all names is come he at whose bidding every single name hath from the beginning that hath no beginning been created he who shall continue to create them as he pleaseth he verily is the all powerful the all wise beware that ye divest not yourselves of the raiment of divine guidance drink ye your fill from the cup which the youths of heaven have raised above your heads thus biddeth you he who hath more mercy upon you than your own selves he who asketh not any recompense or thanks from you his reward is from him who hath through the power of truth sent him down unto you and singled him out and proclaimed him as his own testimony unto the whole of creation he it is who hath empowered him to manifest all his signs repeat the gaze that ye may perceive the things whereunto the tongue of the ancient of days hath summoned you that haply ye may be of them that have apprehended the truth heard it ye ever reported by your fathers of old or by the generations that preceded them even unto the first adam that anyone coming in the clouds of revelation being invested with manifest and transcendent sovereignty having on his right hand the kingdom of god and on his left all the power and glory of his everlasting dominion anyone preceded by the hosts of god the almighty the all compelling the most powerful and uttering continually verses whose import the minds of the most learned and wisest of men are powerless to fathom should yet be the bearer of message that is not of god be discerning then and speak ye the truth the very truth if ye claim to be honest and high minded say the verses we have revealed are as numerous as those which in the preceding revelation were sent down upon the báb let him that doubteth the words which the spirit of god hath spoken seek the court of our presence and hear our divinely revealed verses and be an eyewitness of the clear proof of our claim say by the righteousness of the almighty the measure of the favors of god hath been filled up his word hath been perfected the light of his countenance hath been revealed his sovereignty hath encompassed the whole of creation the glory of his revelation hath been made manifest and his bounties have rained upon all mankind cxxii manis the supreme talisman lack of proper education hath however deprived him of that which he doth inherently possess through word proceeding out of the mouth of god he was called into being by one word more he was guided to recognize the source of his education by yet another word his station and destiny were safeguarded the great being saith regard man as mine rich in gems of inestimable value education can alone cause it to reveal its treasures and enable mankind to benefit therefrom if any man were to meditate on that which the scriptures sent down from the heaven of god’s holy will have revealed he would readily recognize that their purpose is that all men shall be regarded as one soul so that the seal bearing the words “the kingdom shall be god’s” may be stamped on every heart and the light of divine bounty of grace and mercy may envelop all mankind the one true god exalted be his glory hath wished nothing for himself the allegiance of mankind profiteth him not neither doth its perversity harm him the bird of the realm of utterance voiceth continually this call “all things have willed for thee and thee too for thine own sake if the learned and worldly wise men of this age were to allow mankind to inhale the fragrance of fellowship and love every understanding heart would apprehend the meaning of true liberty and discover the secret of undisturbed peace and absolute composure were the earth to attain this station and be illumined with its light it could then be truly said of it “thou shall see in it no hollows or rising hills cxxiii thegenerations that have gone on before you—whither are they fled and those round whom in life circled the fairest and the loveliest of the land where now are they profit by their example people and be not of them that are gone astray others erelong will lay hands on what ye possess and enter into your habitations incline your ears to my words and be not numbered among the foolish for every one of you his paramount duty is to choose for himself that on which no other may infringe and none usurp from him such thing—and to this the almighty is my witness—is the love of god could ye but perceive it build ye for yourselves such houses as the rain and floods can never destroy which shall protect you from the changes and chances of this life this is the instruction of him whom the world hath wronged and forsaken cxxiv howwondrous is the unity of the living the ever abiding god—a unity which is exalted above all limitations that transcendeth the comprehension of all created things he hath from everlasting dwelt in his inaccessible habitation of holiness and glory and will unto everlasting continue to be enthroned upon the heights of his independent sovereignty and grandeur how lofty hath been his incorruptible essence how completely independent of the knowledge of all created things and how immensely exalted will it remain above the praise of all the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth from the exalted source and out of the essence of his favor and bounty he hath entrusted every created thing with sign of his knowledge so that none of his creatures may be deprived of its share in expressing each according to its capacity and rank this knowledge this sign is the mirror of his beauty in the world of creation the greater the effort exerted for the refinement of this sublime and noble mirror the more faithfully will it be made to reflect the glory of the names and attributes of god and reveal the wonders of his signs and knowledge every created thing will be enabled so great is this reflecting power to reveal the potentialities of its preordained station will recognize its capacity and limitations and will testify to the truth that “he verily is god there is none other god besides him ”… there can be no doubt whatever that in consequence of the efforts which every man may consciously exert and as result of the exertion of his own spiritual faculties this mirror can be so cleansed from the dross of earthly defilements and purged from satanic fancies as to be able to draw nigh unto the meads of eternal holiness and attain the courts of everlasting fellowship in pursuance however of the principle that for every thing time hath been fixed and for every fruit season hath been ordained the latent energies of such bounty can best be released and the vernal glory of such gift can only be manifested in the days of god invested though each day may be with its preordained share of god’s wondrous grace the days immediately associated with the manifestation of god possess unique distinction and occupy station which no mind can ever comprehend such is the virtue infused into them that if the hearts of all that dwell in the heavens and the earth were in those days of everlasting delight to be brought face to face with that daystar of unfading glory and attuned to his will each would find itself exalted above all earthly things radiant with his light and sanctified through his grace all hail to this grace which no blessing however great can excel and all honor to such loving kindness the like of which the eye of creation hath not seen exalted is he above that which they attribute unto him or recount about him it is for this reason that in those days no man shall ever stand in need of his neighbor it hath already been abundantly demonstrated that in that divinely appointed day the majority of them that have sought and attained his holy court have revealed such knowledge and wisdom drop of which none else besides these holy and sanctified souls however long he may have taught or studied hath grasped or will ever comprehend it is by virtue of this power that the beloved of god have in the days of the manifestation of the daystar of truth been exalted above and made independent of all human learning nay from their hearts and the springs of their innate powers hath gushed out unceasingly the inmost essence of human learning and wisdom cxxv mybrother when true seeker determineth to take the step of search in the path leading unto the knowledge of the ancient of days he must before all else cleanse his heart which is the seat of the revelation of the inner mysteries of god from the obscuring dust of all acquired knowledge and the allusions of the embodiments of satanic fancy he must purge his breast which is the sanctuary of the abiding love of the beloved of every defilement and sanctify his soul from all that pertaineth to water and clay from all shadowy and ephemeral attachments he must so cleanse his heart that no remnant of either love or hate may linger therein lest that love blindly incline him to error or that hate repel him away from the truth even as thou dost witness in this day how most of the people because of such love and hate are bereft of the immortal face have strayed far from the embodiments of the divine mysteries and shepherdless are roaming through the wilderness of oblivion and error that seeker must at all times put his trust in god must renounce the peoples of the earth must detach himself from the world of dust and cleave unto him who is the lord of lords he must never seek to exalt himself above anyone must wash away from the tablet of his heart every trace of pride and vainglory must cling unto patience and resignation observe silence and refrain from idle talk for the tongue is smoldering fire and excess of speech deadly poison material fire consumeth the body whereas the fire of the tongue devoureth both heart and soul the force of the former lasteth but for time whilst the effects of the latter endure century that seeker should also regard backbiting as grievous error and keep himself aloof from its dominion inasmuch as backbiting quencheth the light of the heart and extinguisheth the life of the soul he should be content with little and be freed from all inordinate desire he should treasure the companionship of them that have renounced the world and regard avoidance of boastful and worldly people precious benefit at the dawn of every day he should commune with god and with all his soul persevere in the quest of his beloved he should consume every wayward thought with the flame of his loving mention and with the swiftness of lightning pass by all else save him he should succor the dispossessed and never withhold his favor from the destitute he should show kindness to animals how much more unto his fellowman to him who is endowed with the power of utterance he should not hesitate to offer up his life for his beloved nor allow the censure of the people to turn him away from the truth he should not wish for others that which he doth not wish for himself nor promise that which he doth not fulfill with all his heart he should avoid fellowship with evildoers and pray for the remission of their sins he should forgive the sinful and never despise his low estate for none knoweth what his own end shall be how often hath sinner attained at the hour of death to the essence of faith and quaffing the immortal draught hath taken his flight unto the concourse on high and how often hath devout believer at the hour of his soul’s ascension been so changed as to fall into the nethermost fire our purpose in revealing these convincing and weighty utterances is to impress upon the seeker that he should regard all else beside god as transient and count all things save him who is the object of all adoration as utter nothingness these are among the attributes of the exalted and constitute the hallmark of the spiritually minded they have already been mentioned in connection with the requirements of the wayfarers that tread the path of positive knowledge when the detached wayfarer and sincere seeker hath fulfilled these essential conditions then and only then can he be called true seeker whensoever he hath fulfilled the conditions implied in the verse “whoso maketh efforts for us he shall enjoy the blessings conferred by the words “in our ways shall we assuredly guide him only when the lamp of search of earnest striving of longing desire of passionate devotion of fervid love of rapture and ecstasy is kindled within the seeker’s heart and the breeze of his loving kindness is wafted upon his soul will the darkness of error be dispelled the mists of doubts and misgivings be dissipated and the lights of knowledge and certitude envelop his being at that hour will the mystic herald bearing the joyful tidings of the spirit shine forth from the city of god resplendent as the morn and through the trumpet blast of knowledge will awaken the heart the soul and the spirit from the slumber of heedlessness then will the manifold favors and outpouring grace of the holy and everlasting spirit confer such new life upon the seeker that he will find himself endowed with new eye new ear new heart and new mind he will contemplate the manifest signs of the universe and will penetrate the hidden mysteries of the soul gazing with the eye of god he will perceive within every atom door that leadeth him to the stations of absolute certitude he will discover in all things the mysteries of divine revelation and the evidences of an everlasting manifestation swear by god were he that treadeth the path of guidance and seeketh to scale the heights of righteousness to attain unto this glorious and exalted station he would inhale at distance of thousand leagues the fragrance of god and would perceive the resplendent morn of divine guidance rising above the dayspring of all things each and every thing however small would be to him revelation leading him to his beloved the object of his quest so great shall be the discernment of this seeker that he will discriminate between truth and falsehood even as he doth distinguish the sun from shadow if in the uttermost corners of the east the sweet savors of god be wafted he will assuredly recognize and inhale their fragrance even though he be dwelling in the uttermost ends of the west he will likewise clearly distinguish all the signs of god—his wondrous utterances his great works and mighty deeds—from the doings the words and ways of men even as the jeweler who knoweth the gem from the stone or the man who distinguisheth the spring from autumn and heat from cold when the channel of the human soul is cleansed of all worldly and impeding attachments it will unfailingly perceive the breath of the beloved across immeasurable distances and will led by its perfume attain and enter the city of certitude therein he will discern the wonders of his ancient wisdom and will perceive all the hidden teachings from the rustling leaves of the tree that flourisheth in that city with both his inner and outer ear he will hear from its dust the hymns of glory and praise ascending unto the lord of lords and with his inner eye will he discover the mysteries of “return” and “revival how unspeakably glorious are the signs the tokens the revelations and splendors which he who is the king of names and attributes hath destined for that city the attainment unto this city quencheth thirst without water and kindleth the love of god without fire within every blade of grass are enshrined the mysteries of an inscrutable wisdom and upon every rosebush myriad nightingales pour out in blissful rapture their melody its wondrous tulips unfold the mystery of the undying fire in the burning bush and its sweet savors of holiness breathe the perfume of the messianic spirit it bestoweth wealth without gold and conferreth immortality without death in each one of its leaves ineffable delights are treasured and within every chamber unnumbered mysteries lie hidden they that valiantly labor in quest of god will when once they have renounced all else but him be so attached and wedded unto that city that moment’s separation from it would to them be unthinkable they will hearken unto infallible proofs from the hyacinth of that assembly and will receive the surest testimonies from the beauty of its rose and the melody of its nightingale once in about thousand years shall this city be renewed and readorned that city is none other than the word of god revealed in every age and dispensation in the days of moses it was the pentateuch in the days of jesus the gospel in the days of muḥammad the messenger of god the qur’án in this day the bayán and in the dispensation of him whom god will make manifest his own book—the book unto which all the books of former dispensations must needs be referred the book that standeth amongst them all transcendent and supreme cxxvi towhatever place we may be banished however great the tribulation we may suffer they who are the people of god must with fixed resolve and perfect confidence keep their eyes directed towards the dayspring of glory and be busied in whatever may be conducive to the betterment of the world and the education of its peoples all that hath befallen us in the past hath advanced the interests of our revelation and blazoned its fame and all that may befall us in the future will have like result cling ye with your inmost hearts to the cause of god cause that hath been sent down by him who is the ordainer the all wise we have with the utmost kindliness and mercy summoned and directed all peoples and nations to that which shall truly profit them the daystar of truth that shineth in its meridian splendor beareth us witness they who are the people of god have no ambition except to revive the world to ennoble its life and regenerate its peoples truthfulness and goodwill have at all times marked their relations with all men their outward conduct is but reflection of their inward life and their inward life mirror of their outward conduct no veil hideth or obscureth the verities on which their faith is established before the eyes of all men these verities have been laid bare and can be unmistakably recognized their very acts attest the truth of these words every discerning eye can in this day perceive the dawning light of god’s revelation and every attentive ear can recognize the voice that was heard from the burning bush such is the rushing of the waters of divine mercy that he who is the dayspring of the signs of god and the revealer of the evidences of his glory is without veil or concealment associating and conversing with the peoples of the earth and its kindreds how numerous are those who with hearts intent upon malice have sought our presence and departed from it loyal and loving friends the portals of grace are wide open before the face of all men in our outward dealings with them we have treated alike the righteous and the sinner that perchance the evildoer may attain the limitless ocean of divine forgiveness our name “the concealer” hath shed such light upon men that the froward hath imagined himself to be numbered with the pious no man that seeketh us will we ever disappoint neither shall he that hath set his face towards us be denied access unto our court friends help ye the one true god exalted be his glory by your goodly deeds by such conduct and character as shall be acceptable in his sight he that seeketh to be helper of god in this day let him close his eyes to whatever he may possess and open them to the things of god let him cease to occupy himself with that which profiteth him and concern himself with that which shall exalt the all compelling name of the almighty he should cleanse his heart from all evil passions and corrupt desires for the fear of god is the weapon that can render him victorious the primary instrument whereby he can achieve his purpose the fear of god is the shield that defendeth his cause the buckler that enableth his people to attain to victory it is standard that no man can abase force that no power can rival by its aid and by the leave of him who is the lord of hosts they that have drawn nigh unto god have been able to subdue and conquer the citadels of the hearts of men cxxvii ifit be your wish people to know god and to discover the greatness of his might look then upon me with mine own eyes and not with the eyes of anyone besides me ye will otherwise be never capable of recognizing me though ye ponder my cause as long as my kingdom endureth and meditate upon all created things throughout the eternity of god the sovereign lord of all the omnipotent the ever abiding the all wise thus have we manifested the truth of our revelation that haply the people may be roused from their heedlessness and be of them that understand behold the low estate of these men who know full well how have offered up mine own self and my kindred in the path of god and for the preservation of their faith in him who are well aware how mine enemies have compassed me about in the days when the hearts of men feared and trembled the days when they hid themselves from the eyes of the loved ones of god and of his enemies and were busied in ensuring their own security and peace we eventually succeeded in manifesting the cause of god and exalted it to so eminent position that all the people except those who cherished ill will in their hearts against this youth and joined partners with the almighty acknowledged the sovereignty of god and his mighty dominion and yet notwithstanding this revelation whose influence hath pervaded all created things and despite the brightness of this light the like of which none of them hath ever beheld witness how the people of the bayán have denied and contended with me some have turned away from the path of god rejected the authority of him in whom they had believed and acted insolently towards god the most powerful the supreme protector the most exalted the most great others hesitated and halted in his path and regarded the cause of the creator in its inmost truth as invalid unless substantiated by the approval of him who was created through the operation of my will thus have their works come to naught and yet they failed to perceive it among them is he who sought to measure god with the measure of his own self and was so misled by the names of god as to rise up against me who condemned me as one that deserved to be put to death and who imputed to me the very offenses of which he himself was guilty wherefore do plead my grief and my sorrow to him who created me and entrusted me with his message unto him do render thanks and praise for the things he hath ordained for my loneliness and the anguish suffer at the hands of these men who have strayed so far from him have patiently sustained and will continue to sustain the tribulation that touched me and will put my whole trust and confidence in god him will supplicate saying guide thy servants my lord unto the court of thy favor and bounty and suffer them not to be deprived of the wonders of thy grace and of thy manifold blessings for they know not what thou hast ordained for them by virtue of thy mercy that encompasseth the whole of creation outwardly lord they are weak and helpless inwardly they are but orphans thou art the all bountiful the munificent the most exalted the most great cast not my god the fury of thy wrath upon them and cause them to tarry until such time when the wonders of thy mercy will have been made manifest that haply they may return unto thee and ask forgiveness of thee for the things they have committed against thee verily thou art the forgiving the all merciful cxxviii say doth it beseem man while claiming to be follower of his lord the all merciful he should yet in his heart do the very deeds of the evil one nay it ill beseemeth him and to this he who is the beauty of the all glorious will bear me witness would that ye could comprehend it cleanse from your hearts the love of worldly things from your tongues every remembrance except his remembrance from your entire being whatsoever may deter you from beholding his face or may tempt you to follow the promptings of your evil and corrupt inclinations let god be your fear people and be ye of them that tread the path of righteousness say should your conduct people contradict your professions how think ye then to be able to distinguish yourselves from them who though professing their faith in the lord their god have as soon as he came unto them in the cloud of holiness refused to acknowledge him and repudiated his truth disencumber yourselves of all attachment to this world and the vanities thereof beware that ye approach them not inasmuch as they prompt you to walk after your own lusts and covetous desires and hinder you from entering the straight and glorious path know ye that by “the world” is meant your unawareness of him who is your maker and your absorption in aught else but him the “life to come on the other hand signifieth the things that give you safe approach to god the all glorious the incomparable whatsoever deterreth you in this

cleaving unto him who is the eternal truth steadfastness that taketh no account of them whatever the second is strict observance of the laws he hath prescribed—laws which he hath always ordained and

mentioned and described in all the heavenly books among them are trustworthiness truthfulness purity of heart while communing with god forbearance resignation to whatever the almighty hath decreed contentment with the things his will hath provided patience nay thankfulness in the midst of tribulation and complete reliance in all circumstances upon him these rank according to the estimate of god among the highest and most laudable of all acts all other acts are and will ever remain secondary and subordinate unto them the spirit that animateth the human heart is the knowledge of god and its truest adorning is the recognition of the truth that “he doeth whatsoever he willeth and ordaineth that which he pleaseth its raiment is the fear of god and its perfection steadfastness in his faith thus god instructeth whosoever seeketh him he verily loveth the one that turneth towards him there is none other god but him the forgiving the most bountiful all praise be to god the lord of all

you to cleave to the things that would shut you out from the manifestation of our beauty in its subsequent revelation be they the embodiments of the names of god and all their glory or the revealers of his attributes and their dominion behold how as soon as revealed myself ye have rejected my truth and turned away from me and been of them that have regarded the signs of god as play and pastime by my beauty nothing whatsoever shall in this day be accepted from you though ye continue to worship and prostrate yourselves before god throughout the eternity of his dominion for all things are dependent upon his will and the worth of all acts is conditioned upon his acceptance and pleasure the whole universe is but handful of clay in his grasp unless one recognize god and love him his cry

previous revelation would that your hearts could comprehend arise and under the eyes of god atone for your failures in duty towards him this is my commandment unto you were ye to incline your ears unto my commandment by mine own self neither the people of the qur’án nor the followers of either the torah or the evangel nor those of any other book have committed that which your hands have wrought

subsequent revelation clothed in the glory of bahá and arrayed in the robe of his grandeur than ye rebelled against him who is the supreme protector the self subsisting beware people be ye ashamed of

their slumber and ask pardon of god who hath formed and fashioned them and sent down unto them this most effulgent this most holy and manifest revelation of his beauty cxxxvi say deliver your souls people from the bondage of self and purify them from all attachment to anything besides me remembrance of me cleanseth all things from defilement could ye but perceive it say were all created things to be entirely divested of the veil of worldly vanity and desire the hand of god would in this day clothe them one and all with the robe “he doeth whatsoever he willeth in the kingdom of creation that

heart of every righteous man to throb though he may at first remain unaware of its effect yet the virtue of the grace vouchsafed unto him must needs sooner or later exercise its influence upon his soul thus have the mysteries of the revelation of god been decreed by virtue of the will of him who is the source of power and wisdom okhalíl god beareth me witness though my pen be still moving on my tablet yet in its very heart it weepeth and is sore distressed the lamp burning before the throne likewise weepeth and groaneth by reason of the things which the ancient beauty hath suffered at the hands of them who are but creation of his will god himself knoweth and testifieth to the truth of my words no man that hath purged his ear from the loud clamor of the infidels and inclined it to all created things can fail to hear the voice of their lamentation and weeping over the trouble that hath befallen us at the hands of those of our servants that have disbelieved in and rebelled against us thus have we disclosed to thee glimmer of the woes that have come upon us that thou mayest be made aware of our sufferings and patiently endure thy sorrows arise to aid thy lord at all times and in all circumstances and be thou one of his helpers admonish then the people to lend hearing ear to the words which the spirit of god hath uttered in this irradiant and resplendent tablet say sow not

and of utterance this indeed well becometh the station of man to depart from it would be unworthy of god the sovereign lord of all the glorified the people however have been led astray and are truly of the heedless unlock people the gates of the hearts of men with the keys of the remembrance of him who is the remembrance of god and the source of wisdom amongst you he hath chosen out of the whole

is our witness whoever hath tasted the sweetness of those words will never consent to transgress the bounds which god hath fixed neither will he turn his gaze towards anyone except his well beloved such man will with his inner eye readily recognize how altogether vain and fleeting are the things of this world and will set his affections on things above say be ashamed ye that call yourselves the lovers of the ancient beauty be ye admonished by the tribulation he hath suffered by the burden of anguish he hath carried for the sake of god let your eyes be opened to what purpose hath he labored if the manifold trials he hath endured are in the end to result in such contemptible professions and such wretched conduct every robber every worker of iniquity hath in the days prior to my revelation uttered these same words and performed these same deeds verily say incline your ears to my sweet voice and sanctify yourselves from the defilement of your evil passions and corrupt desires they who dwell within the tabernacle of god and are established upon the seats of everlasting glory will refuse though they be dying of hunger to stretch their hands and seize unlawfully the property of their neighbor however vile and worthless he may be the purpose of the one true god in manifesting himself is to summon all mankind to truthfulness and sincerity to piety and trustworthiness to resignation and submissiveness to the will of god to forbearance and kindliness to uprightness and wisdom his object is to array every man with the mantle of saintly character and to adorn him with the ornament of holy and goodly deeds say have mercy on yourselves and on your fellowmen and suffer not the cause of god—a cause which is immeasurably exalted above the inmost essence of sanctity—to be sullied with the stain of your idle fancies your unseemly and corrupt imaginations cxxxviii thouseest god of mercy thou whose power pervadeth all created things these servants of thine thy thralls who

the profoundest thinker the devotions of the holiest of saints the highest expressions of praise from either human pen or tongue are but reflection of that which hath been created within themselves through the revelation of the lord their god whoever pondereth this truth in his heart will readily admit that there are certain limits which no human being can possibly transgress every attempt which from the beginning that hath no beginning hath been made to visualize and know god is limited by the exigencies of his own creation—a creation which he through the operation of his own will and for the purposes of none other but his own self hath called into being immeasurably exalted is he above the strivings of human mind to grasp his essence or of human tongue to describe his mystery no tie of direct intercourse can ever bind him to the things he hath created nor can the most abstruse and most remote allusions of his creatures do justice to his being through his world pervading will he hath brought into being all created things he is and hath ever been veiled in the ancient eternity of his own exalted and indivisible essence and will everlastingly continue to remain concealed in his inaccessible majesty and glory all that is in heaven and all that is in the earth have come to exist at his bidding and by his will all have stepped out of utter nothingness into the realm of being

musk laden fragrance upon all created things who else but yourselves is to be blamed if ye choose to remain unendowed with so great an outpouring of god’s transcendent and all encompassing grace with so bright revelation of his resplendent mercy my servants there shineth nothing else in mine heart except the unfading light of the morn of divine guidance and out of my mouth proceedeth naught but

he determineth to leave his home for the sake of the cause of his lord let him put his whole trust in god as the best provision for his journey and array himself with the robe of virtue thus hath it been decreed by god the almighty the all praised if he be kindled with the fire of his love if he forgoeth all created things the words he uttereth shall set on fire them that hear him verily thy lord is the omniscient the all informed happy is the man that hath heard our voice and answered our call he in truth is of them that shall be brought nigh unto us clviii godhath prescribed unto every one the duty of teaching his cause whoever ariseth to discharge this duty must needs ere he proclaimeth his message adorn himself with the ornament of an upright and praiseworthy character so that his words may attract the hearts of such as are receptive to his call without it he can never hope to influence his hearers clix considerthe pettiness of men’s minds they ask for that which injureth them and cast away the thing that profiteth them they are indeed of those that are far astray we find some men desiring liberty and priding themselves therein such men are in the depths of ignorance liberty must in the end lead to sedition whose flames none can quench thus warneth you he who is the reckoner the all knowing know ye that the embodiment of liberty and its symbol is the animal that which beseemeth man is submission unto such restraints as will protect him from his own ignorance and guard him against the harm of the mischief maker liberty causeth man to overstep the bounds of propriety and to infringe on the dignity of his station it debaseth him to the level of extreme depravity and wickedness regard men as flock of sheep that need shepherd for their protection this verily is the truth the certain truth we approve of liberty in certain circumstances and refuse to sanction it in others we verily are the all knowing say true liberty consisteth in man’s submission unto my commandments little as ye know it were men to observe that which we have sent down unto them from the heaven of revelation they would of certainty attain unto perfect liberty happy is the man that hath apprehended the purpose of god in whatever he hath revealed from the heaven of his will that pervadeth all created things say the liberty that profiteth you is to be found nowhere except in complete servitude unto god the eternal truth whoso hath tasted of its sweetness will refuse to barter it for all the dominion of earth and heaven clx heis indeed true believer in the unity of god who in this day will regard him as one immeasurably exalted above all the comparisons and likenesses with which men have compared him he hath erred grievously who hath mistaken these comparisons and likenesses for god himself consider the relation between the craftsman and his handiwork between the painter and his painting can it ever be maintained that the work their hands have produced is the same as themselves by him who is the lord of the throne above and of earth below they can be regarded in no other light except as evidences that proclaim the excellence and perfection of their author oshaykh thou who hast surrendered thy will to god by self surrender and perpetual union with god is meant that men should merge their will wholly in the will of god and regard their desires as utter nothingness beside his purpose whatsoever the creator commandeth his creatures to observe the same must they diligently and with the utmost joy and eagerness arise and fulfill they should in no wise allow their fancy to obscure their judgment neither should they regard their own imaginings as the voice of the eternal in the prayer of fasting we have revealed “should thy will decree that out of thy mouth these words proceed and be addressed unto them ‘observe for my beauty’s sake the fast people and set no limit to its duration swear by the majesty of thy glory that every one of them will faithfully observe it will abstain from whatsoever will violate thy law and will continue to do so until they yield up their souls unto thee in this consisteth the complete surrender of one’s will to the will of god meditate on this that thou mayest drink in the waters of everlasting life which flow through the words of the lord of all mankind and mayest testify that the one true god hath ever been immeasurably exalted above his creatures he verily is the incomparable the ever abiding the omniscient the all wise the station of absolute self surrender transcendeth and will ever remain exalted above every other station it behooveth thee to consecrate thyself to the will of god whatsoever hath been revealed in his tablets is but reflection of his will so complete must be thy consecration that every trace of worldly desire will be washed from thine heart this is the meaning of true unity do thou beseech god to enable thee to remain steadfast in this path and to aid thee to guide the peoples of the world to him who is the manifest and sovereign ruler who hath revealed himself in distinct attire who giveth utterance to divine and specific message this is the essence of faith and certitude they that are the worshipers of the idol which their imaginations have carved and who call it inner reality such men are in truth accounted among the heathen to this hath the all merciful borne witness in his tablets he verily is the all knowing the all wise clxi girdup the loins of thine endeavor that haply thou mayest guide thy neighbor to the law of god the most merciful such an act verily excelleth all other acts in the sight of god the all possessing the most high such must be thy steadfastness in the cause of god that no earthly thing whatsoever will have the power to deter thee from thy duty though the powers of earth be leagued against thee though all men dispute with thee thou must remain unshaken be unrestrained as the wind while carrying the message of him who hath caused the dawn of divine guidance to break consider how the wind faithful to that which god hath ordained bloweth upon all the regions of the earth be they inhabited or desolate neither the sight of desolation nor the evidences of prosperity can either pain or please it it bloweth in every direction as bidden by its creator so should be every one that claimeth to be lover of the one true god it behooveth him to fix his gaze upon the fundamentals of his faith and to labor diligently for its propagation wholly for the sake of god he should proclaim his message and with that same spirit accept whatever response his words may evoke in his hearer he who shall accept and believe shall receive his reward and he who shall turn away shall receive none other than his own punishment on the eve of our departure from ‘iráq we have warned the faithful to anticipate the appearance of the birds of darkness there can be no doubt whatever that the croaking of the raven shall be raised in certain lands as it hath been heard in recent years whatever may betide seek refuge in the one true god that he may shield you from the wiles of the impostor verily say in this most mighty revelation

most high hath at all times and under all conditions remembered with joy and tenderness his loved ones and hath counseled them to follow in his way well is it with him whom the changes and chances of this world have failed to deter from recognizing the dayspring of the unity of god who hath quaffed with unswerving resolve and in the name of the self subsisting the sealed wine of his revelation

which it can be despoiled by no earthly power however mighty its battalions however vast its wealth however profound its influence say the essence of all power is god’s the highest and the last end of all creation the source of all majesty is god’s the object of the adoration of all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth such forces as have their origin in this world of dust are by their very nature unworthy of consideration say the springs that sustain the life of these birds are not of this world their source is far above the reach and ken of human apprehension who is there that can put out the light which the snow white hand of god hath lit where is he to be found that hath the power to quench the fire which hath been kindled through the might of thy lord the all powerful the all compelling the almighty it is the hand of divine might that hath extinguished the flames of dissension powerful is he to do that which he pleaseth he saith be and it is say the fierce gales and whirlwinds of the world and its peoples can never shake the foundation upon which the rocklike stability of my chosen ones is based gracious god what could have prompted these people to enslave and imprison the loved ones of him who is the eternal truth the day however is approaching when the faithful will behold the daystar of justice shining in its full splendor from the dayspring of glory thus instructeth thee the lord of all being in this his grievous prison clxiv membersof the human race hold ye fast by the cord which no man can sever this will indeed profit you all the days of your life for its strength is of god the lord of all worlds cleave ye to justice and fairness and turn away from the whisperings of the foolish them that are estranged from god that have decked their heads with the ornament of the learned and have condemned to death him who is the fountain of wisdom my name hath uplifted them to lofty grades and yet no sooner did reveal myself to their eyes than they with manifest injustice pronounced the sentence of my death thus hath our pen revealed the truth and yet the people are sunk in heedlessness whoso cleaveth to justice can under no circumstances transgress the limits of moderation he discerneth the truth in all things through the guidance of him who is the all seeing the civilization so often vaunted by the learned exponents of arts and sciences will if allowed to overleap the bounds of moderation bring great evil upon men thus warneth you he who is the all knowing if carried to excess civilization will prove as prolific source of evil as it had been of goodness when kept within the restraints of moderation meditate on this people and be not of them that wander distraught in the wilderness of error the day is approaching when its flame will devour the cities when the tongue of grandeur will proclaim “the kingdom is god’s the almighty the all praised all other things are subject to this same principle of moderation render thanks unto thy lord who hath remembered thee in this wondrous tablet all praise be to god the lord of the glorious throne were any man to ponder in his heart that which the pen of the most high hath revealed and to taste of its sweetness he would of certainty find himself emptied and delivered from his own desires and utterly subservient to the will of the almighty happy is the man that hath attained so high station and hath not deprived himself of so bountiful grace in this day we can neither approve the conduct of the fearful that seeketh to dissemble his faith nor sanction the behavior of the avowed believer that clamorously asserteth his allegiance to this cause both should observe the dictates of wisdom and strive diligently to serve the best interests of the faith let every man observe and meditate on the conduct of this wronged one we have ever since the dawn of this revelation until the present time refused either to hide ourself from our enemies or to withdraw from the companionship of our friends though encompassed with myriad griefs and afflictions we have with mighty confidence summoned the peoples of the earth to the dayspring of glory the pen of the most high is disinclined to recount in this connection the woes it hath suffered to reveal them would no doubt plunge into sorrow the favored among the faithful they that truly uphold the unity of god and are wholly devoted to his cause he verily speaketh the truth and is the all hearing the all knowing our life hath for the most part been spent in the midst of our enemies witness how we are at present living in nest of serpents this holy land hath been mentioned and extolled in all the sacred scriptures in it have appeared the prophets of god and his chosen ones this is the wilderness in which all the messengers of god have wandered from which their cry “here am here am my god” was raised this is the promised land in which he who is the revelation of god was destined to be made manifest this is the vale of god’s unsearchable decree the snow white spot the land of unfading splendor whatever hath come to pass in this day hath been foretold in the scriptures of old these same scriptures however unanimously condemn the people that inhabit this land they have at one time been stigmatized as the “generation of vipers behold how this wronged one is now whilst surrounded by “generation of vipers calling aloud and summoning all men to him who is the world’s ultimate desire the summit and dayspring of glory happy is the man that hath hearkened to the voice of him who is the lord of the kingdom of utterance and woe betide the heedless they that have strayed far from his truth clxv knowthou that every hearing ear if kept pure and undefiled must at all times and from every direction hearken to the voice that uttereth these holy words “verily we are god’s and to him shall we return the mysteries of man’s physical death and of his return have not been divulged and still remain unread by the righteousness of god were they to be revealed they would evoke such fear and sorrow that some would perish while others would be so filled with gladness as to wish for death and beseech with unceasing longing the one true god—exalted be his glory—to hasten their end death proffereth unto every confident believer the cup that is life indeed it bestoweth joy and is the bearer of gladness it conferreth the gift of everlasting life as to those that have tasted of the fruit of man’s earthly existence which is the recognition of the one true god exalted be his glory

full thousand years such man is assuredly lying impostor we pray god that he may graciously assist him to retract and repudiate such claim should he repent god will no doubt forgive him if however he persisteth in his error god will assuredly send down one who will deal mercilessly with him terrible indeed is god in punishing whosoever interpreteth this verse otherwise than its obvious meaning is

document has been downloaded from thebahá’í reference library you are free to use its content subject to the terms of use found atwww bahai org legal last modified april gmt the most holy book bahá’u’lláh in shoghi effendi the guardian of the bahá’í faith included as one of the goals of his ten year plan the preparation of synopsis and codification of the laws and ordinances of the kitáb aqdas as an essential prelude to its translation he himself worked on the codification but had not finished it when he died in the task was continued on the basis of his work and the resulting volume was released in that publication included in addition to the synopsis and codification itself and explanatory notes compilation of the passages from the kitáb aqdas which had already been translated by shoghi effendi and published in various books the synopsis and codification covered the text of both the kitáb aqdas and the questions and answers which constitutes an appendix to the aqdas in the universal house of justice decided that the time had come when the preparation of an english translation of the complete text of the most holy book was both possible and essential and made its accomplishment goal of the six year plan its publication in english will be followed by translations in other languages it has been recognized that the kitáb aqdas being sacred scripture should be presented in form which can be read with ease and inspiration uncluttered with the footnotes and index numbers that are common in scholarly texts nonetheless to assist the reader in following the flow of the text and its changing themes paragraph divisions have been added—such divisions not being common in works of arabic literature—and these paragraphs have then been numbered for ease of access and indexing as well as for uniformity of reference in all the languages in which the work will be published following the text of the aqdas is brief compilation of writings of bahá’u’lláh which are supplementary to the most holy book and translation of the questions and answers published here for the first time shoghi effendi had stated that the english translation of the aqdas should be“copiously annotated ”the policy followed in preparing the notes has been to concentrate on those points which might strike non arabic speaking reader as obscure or which for various reasons require elucidation or background information they are not intended to be comprehensive commentary on the text beyond these fundamental requirements the notes which are placed following the synopsis and codification are numbered sequentially each is preceded by quotation of the passage to which it relates and indicates the number of the paragraph in which this appears this facilitates cross reference between the text and the notes while making it possible for readers to study the notes without repeatedly consulting the text if they so prefer it is hoped in this way to meet the needs of readers of wide range of backgrounds and interests the index provides guide to subjects in all sections of the volume the significance and character of the kitáb aqdas and the range of subjects it contains have been graphically depicted by shoghi effendi in his history of the first bahá’í century entitledgod passes by as an assistance to the reader these passages are provided in the section that immediately follows the introduction the synopsis and codification which is republished in this volume serves as another aid for obtaining an overview of the book this year the th of the bahá’í era marks the centenary of the ascension of bahá’u’lláh bearer of the universal revelation of god destined to lead humanity to its collective coming of age that this occasion should be observed by community of believers representing cross section of the entire human race and established in the course of century and half in the most remote corners of the globe is token of the forces of unity released by bahá’u’lláh’s advent further testimony to the operation of these same forces can be seen in the extent to which bahá’u’lláh’s vision has prefigured contemporary human experience in so many of its aspects it is propitious moment for the publication of this first authorized translation into english of the mother book of his revelation his“most holy book ”the book in which he sets forth the laws of god for dispensation destined to endure for no less than thousand years of the more than one hundred volumes comprising the sacred writings of bahá’u’lláh the kitáb aqdas is of unique importance “to build anew the whole world”is the claim and challenge of his message and the kitáb aqdas is the charter of the future world civilization that bahá’u’lláh has come to raise up its provisions rest squarely on the foundation established by past religions for in the words of bahá’u’lláh “this is the changeless faith of god eternal in the past eternal in the future ”in this revelation the concepts of the past are brought to new level of understanding and the social laws changed to suit the age now dawning are designed to carry humanity forward into world civilization the splendors of which can as yet be scarcely imagined in its affirmation of the validity of the great religions of the past the kitáb aqdas reiterates those eternal truths enunciated by all the divine messengers the unity of god love of one’s neighbor and the moral purpose of earthly life at the same time it removes those elements of past religious codes that now constitute obstacles to the emerging unification of the world and the reconstruction of human society the law of god for this dispensation addresses the needs of the entire human family there are laws in the kitáb aqdas which are directed primarily to the members of specific section of humanity and can be immediately understood by them but which at first reading may be obscure to people of different culture such for example is the law prohibiting the confession of sins to fellow human being which though understandable by those of christian background may puzzle others many laws relate to those of past dispensations especially the two most recent ones those of muḥammad and the báb embodied in the qur’án and the bayán nevertheless although certain ordinances of the aqdas have such focused reference they also have universal implications through his law bahá’u’lláh gradually unveils the significance of the new levels of knowledge and behavior to which the peoples of the world are being called he embeds his precepts in setting of spiritual commentary keeping ever before the mind of the reader the principle that these laws no matter the subject with which they deal serve the manifold purposes of bringing tranquillity to human society raising the standard of human behavior increasing the range of human understanding and spiritualizing the life of each and all throughout it is the relationship of the individual soul to god and the fulfillment of its spiritual destiny that is the ultimate aim of the laws of religion “think not ”is bahá’u’lláh’s own assertion “that we have revealed unto you mere code of laws nay rather we have unsealed the choice wine with the fingers of might and power ”his book of laws is his“weightiest testimony unto all people and the proof of the all merciful unto all who are in heaven and all who are on earth an introduction to the spiritual universe unveiled in the kitáb aqdas would fail in its purpose if it did not acquaint the reader with the interpretive and legislative institutions that bahá’u’lláh has indissolubly linked with the system of law thus revealed at the foundation of this guidance lies the unique role which bahá’u’lláh’s writings—indeed the text of the kitáb aqdas itself—confer on his eldest son ‘abdu’l‑bahá this unique figure is at once the exemplar of the pattern of life taught by his father the divinely inspired authoritative interpreter of his teachings and the center and pivot of the covenant which the author of the bahá’í revelation made with all who recognize him the twenty nine years of ‘abdu’l‑bahá’s ministry endowed the bahá’í world with luminous body of commentary that opens multiple vistas of understanding on his father’s purpose in his will and testament ‘abdu’l‑bahá conferred the mantle of guardian of the cause and infallible interpreter of its teachings upon his eldest grandson shoghi effendi and confirmed the authority and guarantee of divine guidance decreed by bahá’u’lláh for the universal house of justice on all matters“which have not outwardly been revealed in the book ”the guardianship and the universal house of justice can thus be seen to be in the words of shoghi effendi the“twin successors”of bahá’u’lláh and ‘abdu’l‑bahá they are the supreme institutions of the administrative order which was founded and anticipated in the kitáb aqdas and elaborated by ‘abdu’l‑bahá in his will during the thirty six years of his ministry shoghi effendi raised up the structure of elected spiritual assemblies—the houses of justice referred to in the kitáb aqdas now in their embryonic stage—and with their collaboration initiated the systematic implementation of the divine plan that ‘abdu’l‑bahá had laid out for the diffusion of the faith throughout the world he also set in motion on the basis of the strong administrative structure that had been established the processes which were an essential preparation for the election of the universal house of justice this body which came into existence in april is elected through secret ballot and plurality vote in three stage election by adult bahá’ís throughout the world the revealed word of bahá’u’lláh together with the interpretations and expositions of the center of the covenant and the guardian of the cause constitute the binding terms of reference of the universal house of justice and are its bedrock foundation as to the laws themselves careful scrutiny discloses that they govern three areas the individual’s relationship to god physical and spiritual matters which benefit the individual directly and relations among individuals and between the individual and society they can be grouped under the following headings prayer and fasting laws of personal status governing marriage divorce and inheritance range of other laws ordinances and prohibitions as well as exhortations and the abrogation of specific laws and ordinances of previous dispensations salient characteristic is their brevity they constitute the kernel of vast range of law that will arise in centuries to come this elaboration of the law will be enacted by the universal house of justice under the authority conferred upon it by bahá’u’lláh himself in one of his tablets ‘abdu’l‑bahá elucidates this principle those matters of major importance which constitute the foundation of the law of god are explicitly recorded in the text but subsidiary laws are left to the house of justice the wisdom of this is that the times never remain the same for change is necessary quality and an essential attribute of this world and of time and place therefore the house of justice will take action accordingly… briefly this is the wisdom of referring the laws of society to the house of justice in the religion of islám similarly not every ordinance was explicitly revealed nay not tenth part of tenth part was included in the text although all matters of major importance were specifically referred to there were undoubtedly thousands of laws which were unspecified these were devised by the divines of later age according to the laws of islamic jurisprudence and individual divines made conflicting deductions from the original revealed ordinances all these were enforced today this process of deduction is the right of the body of the house of justice and the deductions and conclusions of individual learned men have no authority unless they are endorsed by the house of justice the difference is precisely this that from the conclusions and endorsements of the body of the house of justice whose members are elected by and known to the worldwide bahá’í community no differences will arise whereas the conclusions of individual divines and scholars would definitely lead to differences and result in schism division and dispersion the oneness of the word would be destroyed the unity of the faith would disappear and the edifice of the faith of god would be shaken although the universal house of justice is explicitly authorized to change or repeal its own legislation as conditions change thus providing bahá’í law with an essential element of flexibility it cannot abrogate or change any of the laws which are explicitly laid down in the sacred text the society for which certain of the laws of the aqdas are designed will come only gradually into being and bahá’u’lláh has provided for the progressive application of bahá’í law indeed the laws of god are like unto the ocean and the children of men as fish did they but know it however in observing them one must exercise tact and wisdom… since most people are feeble and far removed from the purpose of god therefore one must observe tact and prudence under all conditions so that nothing might happen that could cause disturbance and dissension or raise clamor among the heedless verily his bounty hath surpassed the whole universe and his bestowals encompassed all that dwell on earth one must guide mankind to the ocean of true understanding in spirit of love and tolerance the kitáb aqdas itself beareth eloquent testimony to the loving providence of god the principle governing this progressive application was enunciated in letter written on behalf of shoghi effendi to national spiritual assembly in the laws revealed by bahá’u’lláh in the aqdas are whenever practicable and not in direct conflict with the civil law of the land absolutely binding on every believer or bahá’í institution whether in the east or in the west certain laws should be regarded by all believers as universally and vitally applicable at the present time others have been formulated in anticipation of state of society destined to emerge from the chaotic conditions that prevail today… what has not been formulated in the aqdas in addition to matters of detail and of secondary importance arising out of the application of the laws already formulated by bahá’u’lláh will have to be enacted by the universal house of justice this body can supplement but never invalidate or modify in the least degree what has already been formulated by bahá’u’lláh nor has the guardian any right whatsoever to lessen the binding effect much less to abrogate the provisions of so fundamental and sacred book the number of laws binding on bahá’ís is not increased by the publication of this translation when it is deemed timely the bahá’í community will be advised which additional laws are binding upon believers and any guidance or supplementary legislation necessary for their application will be provided in general the laws of the kitáb aqdas are stated succinctly an example of this conciseness can be seen in the fact that many are expressed only as they apply to man but it is apparent from the guardian’s writings that where bahá’u’lláh has given law as between man and woman it appliesmutatis mutandisbetween woman and man unless the context makes this impossible for example the text of the kitáb aqdas forbids man to marry his father’s wife his stepmother and the guardian has indicated that likewise woman is forbidden to marry her stepfather this understanding of the implications of the law has far reaching effects in light of the fundamental bahá’í principle of the equality of the sexes and should be borne in mind when the sacred text is studied that men and women differ from one another in certain characteristics and functions is an inescapable fact of nature and makes possible their complementary roles in certain areas of the life of society but it is significant that ‘abdu’l‑bahá has stated that in this dispensation“equality of men and women except in some negligible instances has been fully and categorically announced mention has already been made of the intimate relationship between the kitáb aqdas and the holy books of previous dispensations especially close is the relationship to the bayán the book of laws revealed by the báb it is elucidated in the following excerpts from letters written on behalf of the guardian shoghi effendi feels that the unity of the bahá’í revelation as one complete whole embracing the faith of the báb should be emphasized… the faith of the báb should not be divorced from that of bahá’u’lláh though the teachings of the bayán have been abrogated and superseded by the laws of the aqdas yet due to the fact that the báb considered himself as the forerunner of bahá’u’lláh we would regard his dispensation together with that of bahá’u’lláh as forming one entity the former being introductory to the advent of the latter the báb states that his laws are provisional and depend upon the acceptance of the future manifestation this is why in the book of aqdas bahá’u’lláh sanctions some of the laws found in the bayán modifies others and sets aside many just as the bayán had been revealed by the báb at about the midpoint of his ministry bahá’u’lláh revealed the kitáb aqdas around some twenty years after he had received in the síyáh chál of ṭihrán the intimation of his revelation in one of his tablets he indicates that even after its revelation the aqdas was withheld by him for some time before it was sent to the friends in iran thereafter as shoghi effendi has related the formulation by bahá’u’lláh in his kitáb aqdas of the fundamental laws of his dispensation was followed as his mission drew to close by the enunciation of certain precepts and principles which lie at the very core of his faith by the reaffirmation of truths he had previously proclaimed by the elaboration and elucidation of some of the laws he had already laid down by the revelation of further prophecies and warnings and by the establishment of subsidiary ordinances designed to supplement the provisions of his most holy book these were recorded in unnumbered tablets which he continued to reveal until the last days of his earthly life… among such works is the questions and answers compilation made by zaynu’l muqarrabín the most eminent of the transcribers of bahá’u’lláh’s writings consisting of answers revealed by bahá’u’lláh to questions put to him by various believers it constitutes an invaluable appendix to the kitáb aqdas in the most noteworthy of the other tablets of this nature were published in english as compilation entitledtablets of bahá’u’lláh revealed after the kitáb aqdas some years after the revelation of the kitáb aqdas bahá’u’lláh had manuscript copies sent to bahá’ís in iran and in the year towards the end of his life he arranged for the publication of the original arabic text of the book in bombay word should be said about the style of language in which the kitáb aqdas has been rendered into english bahá’u’lláh enjoyed superb mastery of arabic and preferred to use it in those tablets and other writings where its precision of meaning was particularly appropriate to the exposition of basic principle beyond the choice of language itself however the style employed is of an exalted and emotive character immensely compelling particularly to those familiar with the great literary tradition out of which it arose in taking up his task of translation shoghi effendi faced the challenge of finding an english style which would not only faithfully convey the exactness of the text’s meaning but would also evoke in the reader the spirit of meditative reverence which is distinguishing feature of response to the original the form of expression he selected reminiscent of the style used by the seventeenth century translators of the bible captures the elevated mode of bahá’u’lláh’s arabic while remaining accessible to the contemporary reader his translations moreover are illumined by his uniquely inspired understanding of the purport and implications of the originals although both arabic and english are languages with rich vocabularies and varied modes of expression their forms differ widely from one another the arabic of the kitáb aqdas is marked by intense concentration and terseness of expression it is characteristic of this style that if connotation is obvious it should not be explicitly stated this presents problem for reader whose cultural religious and literary background is entirely different from that of arabic literal translation of passage which is clear in the arabic could be obscure in english it therefore becomes necessary to include in the english translation of such passages that element of the arabic sentence which is obviously implicit in the original at the same time it is vital to avoid extrapolating this process to the point where it would add unjustifiably to the original or limit its meaning striking the right balance between beauty and clarity of expression on the one hand and literalness on the other is one of the major issues with which the translators have had to grapple and which has caused repeated reconsideration of the rendering of certain passages another major issue is the legal implication of certain arabic terms which have range of meanings different from those of similar terms in english sacred scripture clearly requires especial care and faithfulness in translation this is supremely important in the case of book of laws where it is vital that the reader not be misled or drawn into fruitless disputation as had been foreseen the translation of the most holy book has been work of the utmost difficulty requiring consultation with experts in many lands since some one third of the text had already been translated by shoghi effendi it was necessary to strive for three qualities in the translation of the remaining passages accuracy of meaning beauty of english and conformity of style with that used by shoghi effendi we are now satisfied that the translation has reached point where it represents an acceptable rendering of the original nevertheless it will undoubtedly give rise to questions and suggestions which may shed further light on its content we are profoundly grateful for the assiduous and meticulous labors of the members of the committees whom we commissioned to prepare and review this translation of the aqdas and to compose the annotations we are confident that this first authorized english edition of the kitáb aqdas will enable its readers to obtain at least an inkling of the splendor of the mother book of the bahá’í dispensation our world has entered the dark heart of an age of fundamental change beyond anything in all of its tumultuous history its peoples of whatever race nation or religion are being challenged to subordinate all lesser loyalties and limiting identities to their oneness as citizens of single planetary homeland in bahá’u’lláh’s words “the well being of mankind its peace and security are unattainable unless and until its unity is firmly established ”may the publication of this translation of the kitáb aqdas lend fresh impulse to the realization of this universal vision opening vistas of worldwide regeneration the universal house of justice taken fromgod passes by his history of the first bahá’í century unique and stupendous as was this proclamation it proved to be but prelude to still mightier revelation of the creative power of its author and to what may well rank as the most signal act of his ministry—the promulgation of the kitáb aqdas alluded to in the kitáb íqán the principal repository of that law which the prophet isaiah had anticipated and which the writer of the apocalypse had described as the“new heaven”and the“new earth ”as“the tabernacle of god ”as the“holy city ”as the“bride ”the“new jerusalem coming down from god ”this“most holy book ”whose provisions must remain inviolate for no less than thousand years and whose system will embrace the entire planet may well be regarded as the brightest emanation of the mind of bahá’u’lláh as the mother book of his dispensation and the charter of his new world order revealed soon after bahá’u’lláh had been transferred to the house of ‘údíkhammár circa at time when he was still encompassed by the tribulations that had afflicted him through the acts committed by his enemies and the professed adherents of his faith this book this treasury enshrining the priceless gems of his revelation stands out by virtue of the principles it inculcates the administrative institutions it ordains and the function with which it invests the appointed successor of its author unique and incomparable among the world’s sacred scriptures for unlike the old testament and the holy books which preceded it in which the actual precepts uttered by the prophet himself are nonexistent unlike the gospels in which the few sayings attributed to jesus christ afford no clear guidance regarding the future administration of the affairs of his faith unlike even the qur’án which though explicit in the laws and ordinances formulated by the apostle of god is silent on the all important subject of the succession the kitáb aqdas revealed from first to last by the author of the dispensation himself not only preserves for posterity the basic laws and ordinances on which the fabric of his future world order must rest but ordains in addition to the function of interpretation which it confers upon his successor the necessary institutions through which the integrity and unity of his faith can alone be safeguarded in this charter of the future world civilization its author—at once the judge the lawgiver the unifier and redeemer of mankind—announces to the kings of the earth the promulgation of the“most great law” pronounces them to be his vassals proclaims himself the“king of kings” disclaims any intention of laying hands on their kingdoms reserves for himself the right to“seize and possess the hearts of men” warns the world’s ecclesiastical leaders not to weigh the“book of god”with such standards as are current amongst them and affirms that the book itself is the“unerring balance”established amongst men in it he formally ordains the institution of the“house of justice ”defines its functions fixes its revenues and designates its members as the“men of justice ”the“deputies of god ”the“trustees of the all merciful” alludes to the future center of his covenant and invests him with the right of interpreting his holy writ anticipates by implication the institution of guardianship bears witness to the revolutionizing effect of his world order enunciates the doctrine of the“most great infallibility”of the manifestation of god asserts this infallibility to be the inherent and exclusive right of the prophet and rules out the possibility of the appearance of another manifestation ere the lapse of at least one thousand years in this book he moreover prescribes the obligatory prayers designates the time and period of fasting prohibits congregational prayer except for the dead fixes the qiblih institutes the ḥuqúqu’lláh right of god formulates the law of inheritance ordains the institution of the mashriqu’l adhkár establishes the nineteen day feast the bahá’í festivals and the intercalary days

importance of marriage and lays down its essential conditions imposes the obligation of engaging in some trade or profession exalting such occupation to the rank of worship emphasizes the necessity of providing the means for the education of children and lays upon every person the duty of writing testament and of strict obedience to one’s government apart from these provisions bahá’u’lláh exhorts his followers to consort with amity and concord and without discrimination with the adherents of all religions warns them to guard against fanaticism sedition pride dispute and contention inculcates upon them immaculate cleanliness strict truthfulness spotless chastity trustworthiness hospitality fidelity courtesy forbearance justice and fairness counsels them to be“even as the fingers of one hand and the limbs of one body” calls upon them to arise and serve his cause and assures them of his undoubted aid he furthermore dwells upon the instability of human affairs declares that true liberty consists in man’s submission to his commandments cautions them not to be indulgent in carrying out his statutes prescribes the twin inseparable duties of recognizing the“dayspring of god’s revelation”and of observing all the ordinances revealed by him neither of which he affirms is acceptable without the other the significant summons issued to the presidents of the republics of the american continent to seize their opportunity in the day of god and to champion the cause of justice the injunction to the members of parliaments throughout the world urging the adoption of universal script and language his warnings to william the conqueror of napoleon iii the reproof he administers to francis joseph the emperor of austria his reference to“the lamentations of berlin”in his apostrophe to“the banks of the rhine” his condemnation of“the throne of tyranny”established in constantinople and his prediction of the extinction of its“outward splendor”and of the tribulations destined to overtake its inhabitants the words of cheer and comfort he addresses to his native city assuring her that god had chosen her to be“the source of the joy of all mankind” his prophecy that“the voice of the heroes ofkhurásán”will be raised in glorification of their lord his assertion that men“endued with mighty valor”will be raised up in kirmán who will make mention of him and finally his magnanimous assurance to perfidious brother who had afflicted him with such anguish that an“ever forgiving all bounteous”god would forgive him his iniquities were he only to repent—all these further enrich the contents of book designated by its author as“the source of true felicity ”as the“unerring balance ”as the“straight path ”and as the“quickener of mankind the laws and ordinances that constitute the major theme of this book bahá’u’lláh moreover has specifically characterized as“the breath of life unto all created things ”as“the mightiest stronghold ”as the“fruits”of his“tree ”as“the highest means for the maintenance of order in the world and the security of its peoples ”as“the lamps of his wisdom and loving providence ”as“the sweet smelling savor of his garment ”and the“keys”of his“mercy”to his creatures “this book ”he himself testifies “is heaven which we have adorned with the stars of our commandments and prohibitions ”“blessed the man ”he moreover has stated “who will read it and ponder the verses sent down in it by god the lord of power the almighty say men take hold of it with the hand of resignation by my life it hath been sent down in manner that amazeth the minds of men verily it is my weightiest testimony unto all people and the proof of the all merciful unto all who are in heaven and all who are on earth ”and again “blessed the palate that savoreth its sweetness and the perceiving eye that recognizeth that which is treasured therein and the understanding heart that comprehendeth its allusions and mysteries by god such is the majesty of what hath been revealed therein and so tremendous the revelation of its veiled allusions that the loins of utterance shake when attempting their description ”and finally “in such manner hath the kitáb aqdas been revealed that it attracteth and embraceth all the divinely appointed dispensations blessed those who peruse it blessed those who apprehend it blessed those who meditate upon it blessed those who ponder its meaning so vast is its range that it hath encompassed all men ere their recognition of it erelong will its sovereign power its pervasive influence and the greatness of its might be manifested on earth in the name of him who is the supreme ruler over all that hath been and all that is to be thefirst duty prescribed by god for his servants is the recognition of him who is the dayspring of his revelation and the fountain of his laws who representeth the godhead in both the kingdom of his cause and the world of creation whoso achieveth this duty hath attained unto all good and whoso is deprived thereof hath gone astray though he be the author of every righteous deed it behooveth everyone who reacheth this most sublime station this summit of transcendent glory to observe every ordinance of him who is the desire of the world these twin duties are inseparable neither is acceptable without the other thus hath it been decreed by him who is the source of divine inspiration they whom god hath endued with insight will readily recognize that the precepts laid down by god constitute the highest means for the maintenance of order in the world and the security of its peoples he that turneth away from them is accounted among the abject and foolish we verily have commanded you to refuse the dictates of your evil passions and corrupt desires and not to transgress

grievously in the sight of god the all possessing the most high ye peoples of the world know assuredly that my commandments are the lamps of my loving providence among my servants and the keys of my mercy for my creatures thus hath it been sent down from the heaven of the will of your lord the lord of revelation were any man to taste the sweetness of the words which the lips of the all merciful have willed to utter he would though the treasures of the earth be in his possession renounce them one and all that he might vindicate the truth of even one of his commandments shining above the dayspring of his bountiful care and loving kindness say from my lawsthe sweet smelling savor of my garmentcan be smelled and by their aid the standards of victory will be planted upon the highest peaks the tongue of my power hath from the heaven of my omnipotent glory addressed to my creation these words “observe my commandments for the love of my beauty happy is the lover that hath inhaled the divine fragrance of his best beloved from these words laden with the perfume of grace which no tongue can describe by my life he who hath drunk the choice wine of fairness from the hands of my bountiful favor will circle around my commandments that shine above the dayspring of my creation think not that we have revealed unto you mere code of laws nay rather we have unsealed the choice wine with the fingers of might and power to this beareth witness that which the pen of revelation hath revealed meditate upon this men of insight we have enjoined obligatory prayer upon you withnine rak‘ahs to be offeredat noon and in the morning and the eveningunto god the revealer of verses we have relieved you of greater number as command in the book of god he verily is the ordainer the omnipotent the unrestrained when ye desire to perform this prayer turn ye towards the court of my most holy presence this hallowed spot that god hath made the center round which circle the concourse on high and which he hath decreed to be the point of adoration for the denizens of the cities of eternity and the source of command unto all that are in heaven and on earth and when the sun of truth and utterance shall set turn your faces towards the spot that we have ordained for you he verily is almighty and omniscient everything that is hath come to be through his irresistible decree whenever my laws appear like the sun in the heaven of mine utterance they must be faithfully obeyed by all though my decree be such as to cause the heaven of every religion to be cleft asunder he doeth what he pleaseth he chooseth and none may question his choice whatsoever he the well beloved ordaineth the same is verily beloved to this he who is the lord of all creation beareth me witness whoso hath inhaled the sweet fragrance of the all merciful and recognized the source of this utterance will welcome with his own eyes the shafts of the enemy that he may establish the truth of the laws of god amongst men well is it with him that hath turned thereunto and apprehended the meaning of his decisive decree we have set forth the details of obligatory prayer in another tablet blessed is he who observeth that whereunto he hath been bidden by him who ruleth over all mankind inthe prayer for the deadsix specific passages have been sent down by god the revealer of verses let one who is able to read recite that which hath been revealed to precede these passages and as for him who is unable god hath relieved him of this requirement he of truth is the mighty the pardoner hair doth not invalidate your prayer nor aught from which the spirit hath departed such as bones and the like ye are free to wear the fur of the sable as ye would that of the beaver the squirrel and other animals the prohibition of its use hath stemmed not from the qur’án but from the misconceptions of the divines he verily is the all glorious the all knowing we have commanded you to pray and fast from the beginning of maturity this is ordained by god your lord and the lord of your forefathers he hath exempted from this those who are weak from illness or age as bounty from his presence and he is the forgiving the generous god hath granted you leave to prostrate yourselves on any surface that is clean for we have removed in this regard the limitation that had been laid down in the book god indeed hath knowledge of that whereof ye know naught let him that findeth no water for ablution repeat five times the words “in the name of god the most pure the most pure and then proceed to his devotions such is the command of the lord of all worlds in regions where the days and nights grow long let times of prayer be gauged by clocks and other instruments that mark the passage of the hours he verily is the expounder the wise we have absolved you from the requirement of performing the prayer of the signs on the appearance of fearful natural events call ye to mind the might and majesty of your lord he who heareth and seeth all and say “dominion is god’s the lord of the seen and the unseen the lord of creation it hath been ordained that obligatory prayer is to be performed by each of you individually save in the prayer for the dead the practice of congregational prayer hath been annulled he of truth is the ordainer the all wise god hath exempted women who are in their courses from obligatory prayer and fasting let them instead after performance of their ablutions give praise unto god repeating ninety five times between the noon of one day and the next “glorified be god the lord of splendor and beauty thus hath it been decreed in the book if ye be of them that comprehend when traveling if ye should stop and rest in some safe spot perform ye—men and women alike—a single prostration in place of each unsaid obligatory prayer and while prostrating say “glorified be god the lord of might and majesty of grace and bounty whoso is unable to do this let him say only “glorified be god” this shall assuredly suffice him he is of truth the all sufficing the ever abiding the forgiving compassionate god upon completing your prostrations seat yourselves cross legged—men and women alike—and eighteen times repeat “glorified be god the lord of the kingdoms of earth and heaven thus doth the lord make plain the ways of truth and guidance ways that lead to one way which is this straight path render thanks unto god for this most gracious favor offer praise unto him for this bounty that hath encompassed the heavens and the earth extol him for this mercy that hath pervaded all creation say god hath made my hidden love the key to the treasure would that ye might perceive it but for the key the treasure would to all eternity have remained concealed would that ye might believe it say this is the source of revelation the dawning place of splendor whose brightness hath illumined the horizons of the world would that ye might understand this is verily that fixed decree through which every irrevocable decree hath been established pen of the most high say people of the world we have enjoined upon you fasting during brief period and at its close have designated for you naw rúz as feast thus hath the daystar of utterance shone forth above the horizon of the book as decreed by him who is the lord of the beginning and the end let the days in excess of the months be placed before the month of fasting we have ordained that these amid all nights and days shall be the manifestations of the letter há and thus they have not been bounded by the limits of the year and its months it behooveth the people of bahá throughout these days to provide good cheer for themselves their kindred and beyond them the poor and needy and with joy and exultation to hail and glorify their lord to sing his praise and magnify his name and when they end—these days of giving that precede the season of restraint—let them enter upon the fast thus hath it been ordained by him who is the lord of all mankind the traveler the ailing those who are with child or giving suck are not bound by the fast they have been exempted by god as token of his grace he verily is the almighty the most generous these are the ordinances of god that have been set down in the books and tablets by his most exalted pen hold ye fast unto his statutes and commandments and be not of those who following their idle fancies and vain imaginings have clung to the standards fixed by their own selves and cast behind their backs the standards laid down by god abstain from food and drink from sunrise to sundown and beware lest desire deprive you of this grace that is appointed in the book it hath been ordained that every believer in god the lord of judgment shall each day having washed his hands and then his face seat himself and turning unto god repeat “alláh abhá” ninety five times such was the decree of the maker of the heavens when with majesty and power he established himself upon the thrones of his names perform ye likewise ablutions for the obligatory prayer this is the command of god the incomparable the unrestrained ye have been forbidden to commit murderor adultery or to engage inbackbiting or calumny shun ye then what hath been prohibited in the holy books and tablets we have divided inheritance into seven categories to the children we have allotted nine parts comprising five hundred and forty shares to the wife eight parts comprising four hundred and eighty shares to the father seven parts comprising four hundred and twenty shares to the mother six parts comprising three hundred and sixty shares to the brothers five parts or three hundred shares to the sisters four partsor two hundred and forty shares and tothe teachers three parts or one hundred and eighty shares such was the ordinance of my forerunner he who extolleth my name in the night season and at the break of day when we heard the clamor of the children as yet unborn we doubled their share and decreased those of the rest he of truth hath power to ordain whatsoever he desireth and he doeth as he pleaseth by virtue of his sovereign might should the deceased leave no offspring their share shall revert tothe house of justice to be expended by the trustees of the all merciful on the orphaned and widowed and on whatsoever will bring benefit to the generality of the people that all may give thanks unto their lord the all gracious the pardoner should the deceased leave offspring but none of the other categories of heirsthat have been specified in the book they shall receive two thirds of the inheritance and the remaining third shall revert to the house of justice such is the command which hath been given in majesty and glory by him who is the all possessing the most high if the deceased should leave none of the specified heirs but have among his relatives nephews and nieces whether on his brother’s or his sister’s side two thirds of the inheritance shall pass to them or lacking these to his uncles and aunts on both his father’s and his mother’s side and after them to their sons and daughters the remaining third of the inheritance shall in any case revert to the seat of justice thus hath it been laid down in the book by him who ruleth over all men should the deceased be survived by none of those whose names have been recorded by the pen of the most high his estate shall in its entirety revert to the aforementioned seat that it may be expended on that which is prescribed by god he verily is the ordainer the omnipotent we have assigned the residence and personal clothing of the deceased to the male not female offspring nor to the other heirs he verily is the munificent the all bountiful should the son of the deceased have passed away in the days of his father and have left children they will inherit their father’s share as prescribed in the book of god divide ye their share amongst them with perfect justice thus have the billows of the ocean of utterance surged casting forth the pearls of the laws decreed by the lord of all mankind if the deceased should leave children who are under age their share of the inheritance must be entrusted to reliable individual or to company that it may be invested on their behalf in trade and business until they come of age the trustee should be assigned due share of the profit that hath accrued to it from being thus employed division of the estate should take place only after the ḥuqúqu’lláh hath been paid any debts have been settled the expenses of the funeral and burial defrayed and such provision made that the deceased may be carried to his resting place with dignity and honor thus hath it been ordained by him who is lord of the beginning and the end say this is that hidden knowledge which shall never change since its beginning is with nine the symbol that betokeneth the concealed and manifest the inviolable and unapproachably exalted name as for what we have appropriated to the children this is bounty conferred on them by god that they may render thanks unto their lord the compassionate the merciful these verily are the laws of god transgress them not at the prompting of your base and selfish desires observe ye the injunctions laid upon you by him who is the dawning place of utterance the sincere among his servants will regard the precepts set forth by god as the water of life to the followers of every faith and the lamp of wisdom and loving providence to all the denizens of earth and heaven the lord hath ordained that in every city house of justice be establishedwherein shall gather counselors tothe number of bahá and should it exceed this number it doth not matter they should consider themselves as entering the court of the presence of god the exalted the most high and as beholding him who is the unseen it behooveth them to be the trusted ones of the merciful among menand to regard themselves as the guardians appointed of god for all that dwell on earth it is incumbent upon them totake counsel togetherand to have regard for the interests of the servants of god for his sake even as they regard their own interests and to choose that which is meet and seemly thus hath the lord your god commanded you beware lest ye put away that which is clearly revealed in his tablet fear god ye that perceive people of the world build ye houses of worship throughout the landsin the name of him who is the lord of all religions make them as perfect as is possible in the world of being and adorn them with that which befitteth them not with images and effigies then with radiance and joy celebrate therein the praise of your lord the most compassionate verily by his remembrance the eye is cheered and the heart is filled with light the lord hath ordained that those of you who are able shall make pilgrimage to the sacred house and from this he hath exempted women as mercy on his part he of truth is the all bountiful the most generous people of bahá it is incumbent upon each one of youto engage in some occupation—such as craft trade or the like we have exalted your engagement in such work to the rank of worship of the one true god reflect people on the grace and blessings of your lord and yield him thanks at eventide and dawn waste not your hours in idleness and sloth but occupy yourselves with what will profit you and others thus hath it been decreed in this tablet from whose horizon hath shone the daystar of wisdom and utterance the most despised of men in the sight of god are they who sit and beg hold ye fast unto the cord of means and place your trust in god the provider of all means the kissing of hands hath been forbidden in the book this practice is prohibited by god the lord of glory and command to none is it permitted to seek absolution from another soul let repentance be between yourselves and god he verily is the pardoner the bounteous the gracious the one who absolveth the repentant ye servants of the merciful one arise to serve the cause of god in such wise that the cares and sorrows caused by them that have disbelieved in the dayspring of the signs of god may not afflict you at the time when the promise was fulfilled and the promised one made manifest differences have appeared amongst the kindreds of the earth and each people hath followed its own fancy and idle imaginings amongst the people is he who seateth himself amid the sandals by the door whilst coveting in his heart the seat of honor say what manner of man art thou vain and heedless one who wouldst appear as other than thou art and among the people is he who layeth claim to inner knowledge and still deeper knowledge concealed within this knowledge say thou speakest false by god what thou dost possess is naught but husks which we have left to thee as bones are left to dogs by the righteousness of the one true god were anyone to wash the feet of all mankind and were he to worship god in the forests valleys and mountains upon high hills and lofty peaks to leave no rock or tree no clod of earth but was witness to his worship—yet should the fragrance of my good pleasure not be inhaled from him his works would never be acceptable unto god thus hath it been decreed by him who is the lord of all how many man hath secluded himself in the climes of india denied himself the things that god hath decreed as lawful imposed upon himself austerities and mortifications and hath not been remembered by god the revealer of verses make not your deeds as snares wherewith to entrap the object of your aspiration and deprive not yourselves of this ultimate objective for which have ever yearned all such as have drawn nigh unto god say the very life of all deeds is my good pleasure and all things depend upon mine acceptance read ye the tablets that ye may know what hath been purposed in the books of god the all glorious the ever bounteous he who attaineth to my love hath title to throne of gold to sit thereon in honor over all the world he who is deprived thereof though he sit upon the dust that dust would seek refuge with god the lord of all religions whoso layeth claim to revelation direct from god ere the expiration of full thousand years such man is assuredly lying impostor we pray god that he may graciously assist him to retract and repudiate such claim should he repent god will no doubt forgive him if however he persisteth in his error god will assuredly send down one who will deal mercilessly with him terrible indeed is god in punishing whosoever interpreteth this verse otherwise than its obvious meaning is deprived of the spirit of god and of his mercy which encompasseth all created things fear god and follow not your idle fancies nay rather follow the bidding of your lord the almighty the all wise erelong shall clamorous voices be raised in most lands shun them my people and follow not the iniquitous and evilhearted this is that of which we gave you forewarning when we were dwelling in ‘iráq then later while in the land of mystery and now from this resplendent spot be not dismayed peoples of the world when the daystar of my beauty is set and the heaven of my tabernacle is concealed from your eyes arise to further my cause and to exalt my word amongst men we are with you at all times and shall strengthen you through the power of truth we are truly almighty whoso hath recognized me will arise and serve me with such determination that the powers of earth and heaven shall be unable to defeat his purpose the peoples of the world are fast asleep were they to wake from their slumber they would hasten with eagerness unto god the all knowing the all wise they would cast away everything they possess be it all the treasures of the earth that their lord may remember them to the extent of addressing to them but one word such is the instruction given you by him who holdeth the knowledge of things hidden in tablet which the eye of creation hath not seen and which is revealed to none except his own self the omnipotent protector of all worlds so bewildered are they in the drunkenness of their evil desires that they are powerless to recognize the lord of all being whose voice calleth aloud from every direction “there is none other god but me the mighty the all wise say rejoice not in the things ye possess tonight they are yours tomorrow others will possess them thus warneth you he who is the all knowing the all informed say can ye claim that what ye own is lasting or secure nay by myself the all merciful ye cannot if ye be of them who judge fairly the days of your life flee away as breath of wind and all your pomp and glory shall be folded up as were the pomp and glory of those gone before you reflect people what hath become of your bygone days your lost centuries happy the days that have been consecrated to the remembrance of god and blessed the hours which have been spent in praise of him who is the all wise by my life neither the pomp of the mighty nor the wealth of the rich nor

possess that which shall profit them they have utterly neglected erelong they will awake from their slumber and find themselves unable to obtain that which hath escaped them in the days of their lord the almighty the all praised did they but know it they would renounce their all that their names may be mentioned before his throne they verily are accounted among the dead amongst the people is he whose learning hath made him proud and who hath been debarred thereby from recognizing my name the self subsisting who when he heareth the tread of sandals following behind him waxeth greater in his own esteemthannimrod say rejected one where now is his abode by god it is the nethermost fire say concourse of divines hear ye not the shrill voice of my most exalted pen see ye not this sun that shineth in refulgent splendor above the all glorious horizon for how long will ye worship the idols of your evil passions forsake your vain imaginings and turn yourselves unto god your everlasting

shall pass to theaghṣán and after them to the house of justice—should it be established in the world by then—that they may use these endowments for the benefit of the places which have been exalted in this cause and for whatsoever hath been enjoined upon them by him who is the god of might and power otherwise the endowments shallrevert to the people of baháwho speak not except by his leave and judge not save in accordance with what god hath decreed in this tablet—lo they are the champions of victory betwixt heaven and earth—that they may use them in the manner that hath been laid down in the book by god the mighty the bountiful lament not in your hours of trial neither rejoice therein seek ye the middle way which is the remembrance of me in your afflictions and reflection over that which may befall you in future thus informeth you he who is the omniscient he who is aware shave not your heads god hath adorned them with hair and in this there are signs from the lord of creation to those who reflect upon the requirements of nature he verily is the god of strength and wisdom notwithstanding it is not seemly to let the hair pass beyond the limit of the ears thus hath it been decreed by him who is the lord of all worlds exile and imprisonment are decreed for the thief and on the third offense place ye mark upon his brow so that thus identified he may not be accepted in the cities of god and his countries beware lest through compassion ye neglect to carry out the statutes of the religion of god do that which hath been bidden you by him who is compassionate and merciful

my glory my loving kindness my mercy that have compassed the world god hath imposed fine on every adulterer and adulteress to be paid to the house of justice nine mithqáls of gold to be doubled if they should repeat the offense such is the penalty which he who is the lord of names hath assigned them in this world and in the world to come he hath ordained for them humiliating torment should

music and singing take heed however lest listening thereto should cause you to overstep the bounds of propriety and dignity let your joy be the joy born of my most great name name that bringeth rapture to the heart and filleth with ecstasy the minds of all who have drawn nigh unto god we verily have made music as ladder for your souls means whereby they may be lifted up unto the realm on high make it not therefore as wings to self and passion truly we are loath to see you numbered with the foolish we have decreed that third part of all fines shall go to the seat of justice and we admonish its men to observe pure justice that they may expend what is thus accumulated for such purposes as have been enjoined upon them by him who is the all knowing the all wise ye men of justice be

faithful should differences arise amongst you over any matter refer it to god while the sun still shineth above the horizon of this heaven and when it hath set refer ye to whatsoever hath been sent down by him this verily is sufficient unto the peoples of the world say let not your hearts be perturbed people when the glory of my presence is withdrawn and the ocean of my utterance is stilled in my presence amongst you there is wisdom and in my absence there is yet another inscrutable to all but god the incomparable the all knowing verily we behold you from our realm of glory and will aid

fresh and soft flowing waters have gushed from the rocks through the sweetness of the words uttered by your lord the unconstrained and still ye slumber cast away that which ye possess and on the wings of detachment soar beyond all created things thus biddeth you the lord of creation the movement of whose pen hath revolutionized the soul of mankind know ye from what heights your lord the all

heaven of revelation it hath been laid down in the bayán that marriage is dependent upon the consent of both parties desiring to establish love unity and harmony amidst our servants we have conditioned it once the couple’s wish is known upon the permission of their parents lest enmity and rancor should arise amongst them and in this we have yet other purposes thus hath our commandment been ordained no marriage may be contracted without payment of dowry which hath been fixedfor city dwellers at nineteen mithqáls of pure gold and for village dwellers at the same amount in silver whoso wisheth to increase this sum it is forbidden him to exceed the limit of ninety five mithqáls thus hath the command been writ in majesty and power if he content himself however with payment of the lowest level it shall be better for him according to the book god verily enricheth whomsoever he willeth through both heavenly and earthly means and he in truth hath power over all things it hath been decreed by god that should any one of his servants intend to travel he must fix for his wife time when he will return home if he return by the promised time he will have obeyed the bidding of his lord and shall be numbered by the pen of his behest among the righteous otherwise if there be good reason for delay he must inform his wife and make the utmost endeavor to return to her should neither of these eventualities occur it behooveth her to wait for period of nine months after which there is no impediment to her taking another husband but should she wait longer god verily loveth those

favor on his part that ye may be accounted among the thankful he who hath divorced his wife may choose upon the passing of each month to remarry her when there is mutual affection and consent so long as she hath not taken another husband should she have wed again then by this other union the separation is confirmed and the matter is concluded unless clearly her circumstances change thus hath the decree been inscribed with majesty in this glorious tablet by him who is the dawning place of beauty if the wife accompany her husband on journey and differences arise between them on the way he is required to provide her with her expenses for one whole year and either to return her whence she came or to entrust her together with the necessaries for her journey to dependable person who is to

the baleful hooting of the owl hath the drunkenness of passion laid hold upon you or is it that ye are sunk in heedlessness spot that art situate on the shores of the two seas the throne of tyranny hath verily been established upon thee and the flame of hatred hath been kindled within thy bosom in such wise that the concourse on high and they who circle around the exalted throne have wailed and lamented we behold in thee the foolish ruling over the wise and darkness vaunting itself against the light thou art indeed filled with manifest pride hath thine outward splendor made thee vainglorious by him who is the lord of mankind it shall soon perish and thy daughters and thy widows and all the kindreds that dwell within thee shall lament thus informeth thee the all knowing the all wise banks

the earth with the vesture of his laws through which all hearts will rejoice and all eyes be brightened should anyone acquire one hundred mithqáls of gold nineteen mithqáls thereof are god’s and to be rendered unto him the fashioner of earth and heaven take heed people lest ye deprive yourselves of so great bounty this we have commanded you though we are well able to dispense with you and with all who are in the heavens and on earth in it there are benefits and wisdoms beyond the ken of anyone but god the omniscient the all informed say by this means he hath desired to purify what ye possess and to enable you to draw nigh unto such stations as none can comprehend save those whom god hath willed he in truth is the beneficent the gracious the bountiful people deal not faithlessly with the right of god nor without his leave make free with its disposal thus hath his commandment been established in the holy tablets and in this exalted book he who dealeth faithlessly with god shall in justice meet with faithlessness himself he however who acteth in accordance with god’s bidding shall receive blessing from the heaven of the bounty of his lord the gracious the bestower the generous the ancient of days he verily hath willed for you that which is yet beyond your knowledge but which shall be known to you when after this fleeting life your souls soar heavenwards and the trappings of your earthly joys are folded up thus admonisheth you he in whose possession is the guarded tablet various petitions have come before our throne from the believers concerning laws from god the lord of the seen and the unseen the lord of all worlds we have in consequence revealed this holy tablet and arrayed it with the mantle of his law that haply the people may keep the commandments of their lord similar requests had been made of us over several previous years but we had in our wisdom withheld our pen until in recent days letters arrived from number of the friends and we have therefore responded through the power of truth with that which shall quicken the hearts of men say leaders of religion weigh not the book of god with such standards and sciences as are current amongst you for the book itself is the unerring balance established amongst men in this most perfect balance whatsoever the peoples and kindreds of the earth possess must be weighed while the measure of its weight should be tested according to its own standard did ye but know it the eye of my loving kindness weepeth sore over you inasmuch as ye have failed to recognize the one upon whom ye have been calling in the daytime and in the night season at even and at morn advance people with snow white faces and radiant hearts unto the blest andcrimson spot wherein thesadratu’l muntaháis calling “verily there is none other god beside me the omnipotent protector the self subsisting ye leaders of religion who is the man amongst you that can rival me in vision or insight where is he to be found that dareth to claim to be my equal in utterance or wisdom no by my lord the all merciful all on the earth shall pass away and this is the face of your lord the almighty the well beloved we have decreed people that the highest and last end of all learning be the recognition of him who is the object of all knowledge and yet behold how ye have allowed your learning to shut you out as by veil from him who is the dayspring of this light through whom every hidden thing hath been revealed could ye but discover the source whence the splendor of this utterance is diffused ye would cast away the peoples of the world and all that they possess and would draw nigh unto this most blessed seat of glory say this verily is the heaven in whichthe mother bookis treasured could ye but comprehend it he it is who hath caused the rock to shout and the burning bush to lift up its voice upon the mount rising above the holy land and proclaim “the kingdom is god’s the sovereign lord of all the all powerful the loving we have not entered any school nor read any of your dissertations incline your ears to the words of this unlettered one wherewith he summoneth you unto god the ever abiding better is this for you than all the treasures of the earth could ye but comprehend it whoso interpreteth what hath been sent down from the heaven of revelation and altereth its evident meaning he verily is of them that have perverted the sublime word of god and is of the lost ones in the lucid book it hath been enjoined upon you to pare your nails to bathe yourselves each week in water that covereth your bodies and to clean yourselves with whatsoever ye have formerly employed take heed lest through negligence ye fail to observe that which hath been prescribed unto you by him who is the incomparable the gracious immerse yourselves in clean water it is not permissible to bathe yourselves in water that hath already been used see that yeapproach not the public pools of persian baths whoso maketh his way toward such baths will smell their fetid odor ere he entereth therein shun them people and be not of those who ignominiously accept such vileness in truth they are as sinks of foulness and contamination if ye be of them that apprehend avoid ye likewise the malodorous pools in the courtyards of persian homes and be ye of the pure and sanctified truly we desire to behold you as manifestations of paradise on earth that there may be diffused from you such fragrance as shall rejoice the hearts of the favored of god if the bather instead of entering the water wash himself by pouring it upon his body it shall be better for him and shall absolve him of the need for bodily immersion the lord verily hath willed as bounty from his presence to make life easier for you that ye may be of those who are truly thankful it is forbidden you to wed your fathers’ wives we shrink for very shame from treating ofthe subject of boys fear ye the merciful peoples of the world commit not that which is forbidden you in our holy tablet and be not of those who rove distractedly in the wilderness of their desires to none is it permitted to mutter sacred verses before the public gaze as he walketh in the street or marketplace nay rather if he wish to magnify the lord it behooveth him to do so in such places as have been erected for this purpose or in his own home this is more in keeping with sincerity and godliness thus hath the sun of our commandment shone forth above the horizon of our utterance blessed then be those who do our bidding unto everyone hath been enjoined the writing of will the testator should head this document with the adornment ofthe most great name bear witness therein unto the oneness of god in the dayspring of his revelation and make mention as he may wish of that which is praiseworthy so that it may be testimony for him in the kingdoms of revelation and creation and treasure with his lord the supreme protector the faithful all feasts have attained their consummation in the two most great festivals and in the two other festivals that fall on the twin days—the first of the most great festivals being those days whereon the all merciful shed upon the whole of creation the effulgent glory of his most excellent names and his most exalted attributes and the second being that day on which we raised up the one who announced unto mankind the glad tidings of this name through which the dead have been resurrected and all who are in the heavens and on earth have been gathered together thus hath it been decreed by him who is the ordainer the omniscient happy the one who entereth uponthe first day of the month of bahá the day which god hath consecrated to this great name and blessed be he who evidenceth on this day the bounties that god hath bestowed upon him he verily is of those who show forth thanks to god through actions betokening the lord’s munificence which hath encompassed all the worlds say this day verily is the crown of all the months and the source thereof the day on which the breath of life is wafted over all created things great is the blessedness of him who greeteth it with radiance and joy we testify that he is in truth among those who are blissful say the most great festival is indeed the king of festivals call ye to mind people the bounty which god hath conferred upon you ye were sunk in slumber and lo he aroused you by the reviving breezes of his revelation and made known unto you his manifest and undeviating path resort ye in times of sickness to competent physicians we have not set aside the use of material means rather have we confirmed it through this pen which god hath made to be the dawning place of his shining and glorious cause god had formerly laid upon each one of the believers the duty of offering before our throne priceless gifts from among his possessions now in token of our gracious favor we have absolved them of this obligation he of truth is the most generous the all bountiful blessed is he who atthe hour of dawn centering his thoughts on god occupied with his remembrance and supplicating his forgiveness directeth his steps to the mashriqu’l adhkár and entering therein seateth himself in silence to listen to the verses of god the sovereign the mighty the all praised say the mashriqu’l adhkár is each and every building which hath been erected in cities and villages for the celebration of my praise such is the name by which it hath been designated before the throne of glory were ye of those who understand they who recite the verses of the all merciful in the most melodious of tones will perceive in them that with which the sovereignty of earth and heaven can never be compared from them they will inhale the divine fragrance of my worlds—worlds which today none can discern save those who have been endowed with vision through this sublime this beauteous revelation say these verses draw hearts that are pure unto those spiritual worlds that can neither be expressed in words nor intimated by allusion blessed be those who hearken assist ye my people my chosen servants who have arisen to make mention of me among my creatures and to exalt my word throughout my realm these truly are the stars of the heaven of my loving providence and the lamps of my guidance unto all mankind but he whose words conflict with that which hath been sent down in my holy tablets is not of me beware lest ye follow any impious pretender these tablets are embellished with the seal of him who causeth the dawn to appear who lifteth up his voice between the heavens and the earth lay hold on this sure handle and on the cord of my mighty and unassailable cause the lord hath granted leave to whosoever desireth it that he be instructed in the divers tongues of the world that he may deliver the message of the cause of god throughout the east and throughout the west that he make mention of him amidst the kindreds and peoples of the world in such wise that hearts may revive and the moldering bone be quickened it is inadmissible that man who hath been endowed with reason should consume that which stealeth it away nay rather it behooveth him to comport himself in manner worthy of the human station and not in accordance with the misdeeds of every heedless and wavering soul adorn your heads with the garlands of trustworthiness and fidelity your hearts with the attire of the fear of god your tongues with absolute truthfulness your bodies with the vesture of courtesy these are in truth seemly adornings unto the temple of man if ye be of them that reflect cling ye people of bahá to the cord of servitude unto god the true one for thereby your stations shall be made manifest your names written and preserved your ranks raised and your memory exalted in the preserved tablet beware lest the dwellers on earth hinder you from this glorious and exalted station thus have we exhorted you in most of our epistles and now in this our holy tablet above which hath beamed the daystar of the laws of the lord your god the powerful the all wise when the ocean of my presence hath ebbed and the book of my revelation is ended turn your faces towards him whom god hath purposed who hath branched from this ancient root consider the pettiness of men’s minds they ask for that which injureth them and cast away the thing that profiteth them they are indeed of those that are far astray we find some men desiring liberty and priding themselves therein such men are in the depths of ignorance liberty must in the end lead to sedition whose flames none can quench thus warneth you he who is the reckoner the all knowing know ye that the embodiment of liberty and its symbol is the animal that which beseemeth man is submission unto such restraints as will protect him from his own ignorance and guard him against the harm of the mischief maker liberty causeth man to overstep the bounds of propriety and to infringe on the dignity of his station it debaseth him to the level of extreme depravity and wickedness regard men as flock of sheep that need shepherd for their protection this verily is the truth the certain truth we approve of liberty in certain circumstances and refuse to sanction it in others we verily are the all knowing say true liberty consisteth in man’s submission unto my commandments little as ye know it were men to observe that which we have sent down unto them from the heaven of revelation they would of certainty attain unto perfect liberty happy is the man that hath apprehended the purpose of god in whatever he hath revealed from the heaven of his will that pervadeth all created things say the liberty that profiteth you is to be found nowhere except in complete servitude unto god the eternal truth whoso hath tasted of its sweetness will refuse to barter it for all the dominion of earth and heaven in the bayán it had been forbidden you to ask us questions the lord hath now relieved you of this prohibition that ye may be free to ask what you need to ask but not such idle questions as those on which the men of former times were wont to dwell fear god and be ye of the righteous ask ye that which shall be of profit to you in the cause of god and his dominion for the portals of his tender compassion have been opened before all who dwell in heaven and on earth the number of months in year appointed in the book of god is nineteen of thesethe first hath been adorned with this name which overshadoweth the whole of creation the lord hath decreed that the dead should be interred in coffinsmade of crystal of hard resistant stone or of wood that is both fine and durable and that graven rings should be placed upon their fingers he verily is the supreme ordainer the one apprised of all the inscription on these rings should read for men “unto god belongeth all that is in the heavens and on the earth and whatsoever is between them and he in truth hath knowledge of all things” and for women “unto god belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them and he in truth is potent over all things these are the verses that were revealed aforetime but lo the point of the bayánnow calleth out exclaiming “o best beloved of the worlds reveal thou in their stead such words as will waft the fragrance of thy gracious favors over all mankind we have announced unto everyone that one single word from thee excelleth all that hath been sent down in the bayán thou indeed hast power to do what pleaseth thee deprive not thy servants of the overflowing bounties of the ocean of thy mercy thou in truth art he whose grace is infinite behold we have hearkened to his call and now fulfill his wish he verily is the best beloved the answerer of prayers if the following verse which hath at this moment been sent down by god be engraved upon the burial rings of both men and women it shall be better for them we of certainty are the supreme ordainer “i came forth from god and return unto him detached from all save him holding fast to his name the merciful the compassionate thus doth the lord single out whomsoever he desireth for bounty from his presence he is in very truth the god of might and power the lord hath decreed moreover thatthe deceased should be enfolded in five sheets of silk or cotton for those whose means are limited single sheet of either fabric will suffice thus hath it been ordained by him who is the all knowing the all informed it is forbidden you to transport the body of the deceased greater distance than one hour’s journey from the city rather should it be interred with radiance and serenity in nearby place god hath removed the restrictions on travel that had been imposed in the bayán he verily is the unconstrained he doeth as he pleaseth and ordaineth whatsoever he willeth peoples of the world give ear unto the call of him who is the lord of names who proclaimeth unto you from his habitation in the most great prison “verily no god is

to mind these words which have streamed forth intribute to this revelation from the pen of him who was my herald and consider what the hands of the oppressors have wrought throughout my days truly they are numbered with the lost he said “should ye attain the presence of him whom we shall make manifest beseech ye god in his bounty to grant that he might deign to seat himself upon your couches for that act in itself would confer upon you matchless and surpassing honor should he drink cup of water in your homes this would be of greater consequence for you than your proffering unto every soul nay unto every created thing the water of its very life know this ye my servants such are the words with which my forerunner hath extolled my being could ye but understand whoso reflecteth upon these verses and realizeth what hidden pearls have been enshrined within them will by the righteousness of god perceive the fragrance of the all merciful wafting from the direction of this prison and will with his whole heart hasten unto him with such ardent longing that the hosts of earth and heaven would be powerless to deter him say this is revelation around which every proof and testimony doth circle thus hath it been sent down by your lord the god of mercy if ye be of them that judge aright say this is the very soul of all scriptures which hath been breathed into the pen of the most high causing all created beings to be dumbfounded save only those who have been enraptured by the gentle breezes of my loving kindness and the sweet savors of my bounties which have pervaded the whole of creation people of the bayán fear ye the most merciful and consider what he hath revealed in another passage he said “the qiblih is indeed he whom god will make manifest whenever he moveth it moveth until he shall come to rest ”thus was it set down by the supreme ordainer when he desired to make mention of this most great beauty meditate on this people and be not of them that wander distraught in

instead the part of ignominy and abasement naught shall avail you in this day but god nor is there any refuge to flee to save him the omniscient the all wise whoso hath known me hath known the goal of all desire and whoso hath turned unto me hath turned unto the object of all adoration thus hath it been set forth in the book and thus hath it been decreed by god the lord of all worlds to read but one of the verses of my revelation is better than to peruse the scriptures of both the former and latter generations this is the utterance of the all merciful would that ye had ears to hear say this is the essence of knowledge did ye but understand and now consider what hath been revealed in yet another passage that perchance ye may forsake your own concepts and set your faces towards god the lord of being he hath said “it is unlawful to enter into marriage save with believer in the bayán should only one party to marriage embrace this cause his or her possessions will become unlawful to the other until such time as the latter hath converted this law however will only take effect after the exaltation of the cause of him whom we shall manifest in truth or of that which hath already been made manifest in justice ere this ye are at liberty to enter into wedlock as ye wish that haply by this means ye may exalt the cause of god thus hath the nightingale sung with sweet melody upon the celestial bough in praise of its lord the all merciful well is it with them that hearken people of the bayán adjure you by your lord the god of mercy to look with the eye of fairness upon this utterance which hath been sent down through the power of truth and not to be of those who see the testimony of god yet reject and deny it they in truth are of those who will assuredly perish the point

his best beloved and at this moment he listeneth to these verses descending from the heaven of revelation and bewaileth the wrongs ye have committed in these days fear god and join not with the aggressor say people should ye choose to disbelieve in him refrain at least from rising up against him by god sufficient are the hosts of tyranny that are leagued against him verily he revealed certain laws so that in this dispensation the pen of the most high might have no need to move in aught but the glorification of his own transcendent station and his most effulgent beauty since however

calling rejected him whilea sifter of wheat and barleyaccepted him and turned unto the lord though he was occupied both night and day in setting down what he conceived to be the laws and ordinances of god yet when he who is the unconstrained appeared not one letter thereof availed him or he would not have turned away from countenance that hath illumined the faces of the well favored of the lord had

iii allusion to siyyid muḥammad iṣfahání assurance of aid to all those who arise to serve the faith the sweet smelling savor of my garment¶ this is an allusion to the story of joseph in the qur’án and the old testament in which joseph’s garment brought by his brothers to jacob their father enabled jacob to identify his beloved long lost son the metaphor of the fragrant“garment”is frequently used in the bahá’í writings to refer to the recognition of the manifestation of god and his revelation bahá’u’lláh in one of his tablets describes himself as the“divine joseph”who has been“bartered away”by the heedless“for the most paltry of prices ”the báb in the qayyúmu’l asmá’ identifies bahá’u’lláh as the“true joseph”and forecasts the ordeals that he would endure at the hands of his treacherous brother see note likewise shoghi effendi draws parallel between the intense jealousy which the preeminence of ‘abdu’l‑bahá had aroused in his half brother mírzá muḥammad ‘alí and the deadly envy “which the superior excellence of joseph had kindled in the hearts of his brothers we have unsealed the choice wine with the fingers of might and power the consumption of wine and other intoxicants is prohibited in the kitáb aqdas see notes and reference to the use of “wine” in an allegorical sense—such as being the cause of spiritual ecstasy—is found not only in the revelation of bahá’u’lláh but in the bible in the qur’án and in ancient hindu traditions for example in the qur’án the righteous are promised that they will be given to drink of the“choice sealed wine ”in his tablets bahá’u’lláh identifies the“choice wine”with his revelation whose“musk laden fragrance”has been wafted“upon all created things ”he states that he has“unsealed”this“wine ”thereby disclosing spiritual truths that were hitherto unknown and enabling those who quaff thereof to“discern the splendors of the light of divine unity”and to“grasp the essential purpose underlying the scriptures of god in one of his meditations bahá’u’lláh entreats god to supply the believers with“the choice wine of thy mercy that it may cause them to be forgetful of anyone except thee and to arise to serve thy cause and to be steadfast in their love for thee we have enjoined obligatory prayer upon you¶ in arabic there are several words for prayer the word “ṣalát which appears here in the original refers to particular category of prayers the recitation of which at specific times of the day is enjoined on the believers to differentiate this category of prayers from other kinds the word has been translated as“obligatory prayer bahá’u’lláh states that“obligatory prayer and fasting occupy an exalted station in the sight of god” ‘abdu’l‑bahá affirms that such prayers are“conducive to humility and submissiveness to setting one’s face towards god and expressing devotion to him ”and that through these prayers“man holdeth communion with god seeketh to draw near unto him converseth with the true beloved of his heart and attaineth spiritual stations the obligatory prayer see note referred to in this verse has been superseded by the three obligatory prayers later revealed by bahá’u’lláh the texts of the three prayers currently in use together with instructions regarding their recital are to be found in this volume in some texts supplementary to the kitáb aqdas number of the items in questions and answers deal with aspects of the three new obligatory prayers bahá’u’lláh clarifies that the individual is permitted to choose any one of the three obligatory prayers other provisions are elucidated in questions and answers numbers and the details of the law concerning obligatory prayer are summarized in section iv of the synopsis and codification nine rak‘ahs¶ rak‘ah is the recitation of specifically revealed verses accompanied by prescribed set of genuflections and other movements the obligatory prayer originally enjoined by bahá’u’lláh upon his followers consisted of nine rak‘ahs the precise nature of this prayer and the specific instructions for its recitation are unknown as the prayer has been lost see note in tablet commenting on the presently binding obligatory prayers ‘abdu’l‑bahá indicates that“in every word and movement of the obligatory prayer there are allusions mysteries and wisdom that man is unable to comprehend and letters and scrolls cannot contain shoghi effendi explains that the few simple directions given by bahá’u’lláh for the recital of certain prayers not only have spiritual significance but that they also help the individual “to fully concentrate when praying and meditating at noon and in the morning and the evening¶ regarding the definition of the words“morning ”“noon”and“evening ”at which times the currently binding medium obligatory prayer is to be recited bahá’u’lláh has stated that these coincide with“sunrise noon and sunset” he specifies that the“allowable times for obligatory prayers are from morning till noon from noon till sunset and from sunset till two hours thereafter ”further ‘abdu’l‑bahá has stated that the morning obligatory prayer may be said as early as dawn the definition of“noon”as the period“from noon till sunset”applies to the recitation of the short obligatory prayer as well as the medium one we have relieved you of greater number¶ the requirements for obligatory prayer called for in the bábí and islamic dispensations were more demanding than those for the performance of the obligatory prayer consisting of nine rak‘ahs that was prescribed in the kitáb aqdas see note in the bayán the báb prescribed an obligatory prayer consisting of nineteen rak‘ahs which was to be performed once in twenty four hour period—from noon of one day to noon of the next the muslim prayer is recited five times day namely in the early morning at midday in the afternoon and evening and at night while the number of rak‘ahs varies according to the time of recitation total of seventeen rak‘ahs are offered in the course of day when ye desire to perform this prayer turn ye towards the court of my most holy presence this hallowed spot that god hath decreed to be the point of adoration for the denizens of the cities of eternity¶ the“point of adoration ”that is the point to which the worshiper should turn when offering obligatory prayer is called the qiblih the concept of qiblih has existed in previous religions jerusalem in the past had been fixed for this purpose muḥammad changed the qiblih to mecca the báb’s instructions in the arabic bayán were the qiblih is indeed he whom god will make manifest whenever he moveth it moveth until he shall come to rest this passage is quoted by bahá’u’lláh in the kitáb aqdas and confirmed by him in the above noted verse he has also indicated that facing in the direction of the qiblih is a“fixed requirement for the recitation of obligatory prayer” and however for other prayers and devotions the individual may face in any direction and when the sun of truth and utterance shall set turn your faces towards the spot that we have ordained for you¶ bahá’u’lláh ordains his resting place as the qiblih after his passing the most holy tomb is at bahjí ‘akká ‘abdu’l‑bahá describes that spot as the“luminous shrine ”“the place around which circumambulate the concourse on high in letter written on his behalf shoghi effendi uses the analogy of the plant turning in the direction of the sun to explain the spiritual significance of turning towards the qiblih just as the plant stretches out to the sunlight—from which it receives life and growth—so we turn our hearts to the manifestation of god bahá’u’lláh when we pray we turn our faces to where his dust lies on this earth as symbol of the inner act we have set forth the details of obligatory prayer in another tablet the original obligatory prayer had“for reasons of wisdom”been revealed by bahá’u’lláh in separate tablet it was not released to the believers in his lifetime having been superseded by the three obligatory prayers now in use shortly after the ascension of bahá’u’lláh the text of this prayer along with number of other tablets was stolen by muḥammad ‘alí the arch breaker of his covenant the prayer for the dead¶ the prayer for the dead see some texts supplementary to the kitáb aqdas is the only bahá’í obligatory prayer which is to be recited in congregation it is to be recited by one believer while all present stand in silence see note bahá’u’lláh has clarified that the prayer for the dead is required only when the deceased is an adult that the recital should precede the interment of the deceased and that there is no requirement to face the qiblih when saying this prayer further details concerning the prayer for the dead are summarized in the synopsis and codification section iv six specific passages have been sent down by god the revealer of verses¶ the passages that form part of the prayer for the dead comprise the repetition of the greeting “alláh abhá” god is the all glorious six times each followed by nineteen repetitions of one of six specifically revealed verses these verses are identical with those in the prayer for the dead revealed by the báb in the bayán bahá’u’lláh added supplication to precede these passages hair doth not invalidate your prayer nor aught from which the spirit hath departed such as bones and the like ye are free to wear the fur of the sable as ye would that of the beaver the squirrel and other animals¶ in some earlier religious dispensations the wearing of the hair of certain animals or having certain other objects on one’s person was held to invalidate one’s prayer bahá’u’lláh here confirms the báb’s pronouncement in the arabic bayán that such things do not invalidate one’s prayer we have commanded you to pray and fast from the beginning of maturity¶ bahá’u’lláh defines the “age of maturity with respect to religious duties” as“fifteen for both men and women” for details of the period of fasting see note he hath exempted from this those who are weak from illness or age¶ the exemption of those who are weak due to illness or advanced age from offering the obligatory prayers and from fasting is explained in questions and answers bahá’u’lláh indicates that in“time of ill health it is not permissible to observe these obligations” he defines old age in this context as being from seventy in answer to question shoghi effendi has clarified that people who attain the age of seventy are exempt whether or not they are weak exemption from fasting is also granted to the other specific categories of people listed in the synopsis and codification section iv see notes and for additional discussion god hath granted you leave to prostrate yourselves on any surface that is clean for we have removed in this regard the limitation that had been laid down in the book¶ the requirements of prayer in previous dispensations have often included prostration in the arabic bayán the báb called upon the believers to lay their foreheads on surfaces of crystal when prostrating similarly in islám certain restrictions are imposed with regard to the surface on which muslims are permitted to prostrate bahá’u’lláh abrogates such restrictions and simply specifies“any surface that is clean let him that findeth no water for ablution repeat five times the words “in the name of god the most pure the most pure and then proceed to his devotions ablutions are to be performed by the believer in preparation for the offering of obligatory prayer they consist of washing the hands and face if water is unavailable the repetition five times of the specifically revealed verse is prescribed see note for general discussion of ablutions antecedents in earlier dispensations for the provision of substitute procedures to be followed when no water is available are found in the qur’án and in the arabic bayán in regions where the days and nights grow long let times of prayer be gauged by clocks and other instruments that mark the passage of the hours this refers to territories situated in the extreme north or south where the duration of days and nights varies markedly and this provision applies also to fasting we have absolved you from the requirement of performing the prayer of the signs the prayer of the signs is special form of muslim obligatory prayer that was ordained to be said in times of natural events like earthquakes eclipses and other such phenomena which may cause fear and are taken to be signs or acts of god the requirement of performing this prayer has been annulled in its place bahá’í may say “dominion is god’s the lord of the seen and the unseen the lord of creation ”but this is not obligatory save in the prayer for the dead the practice of congregational prayer hath been annulled congregational prayer in the sense of formal obligatory prayer which is to be recited in accordance with prescribed ritual as for example is the custom in islám where friday prayer in the mosque is led by an imám has been annulled in the bahá’í dispensation the prayer for the dead see note is the only congregational prayer prescribed by bahá’í law it is to be recited by one of those present while the remainder of the party stands in silence the reader has no special status the congregation is not required to face the qiblih the three daily obligatory prayers are to be recited individually not in congregation there is no prescribed way for the recital of the many other bahá’í prayers and all are free to use such non obligatory prayers in gatherings or individually as they please in this regard shoghi effendi states that …although the friends are thus left free to follow their own inclination they should take the utmost care that any manner they practice should not acquire too rigid character and thus develop into an institution this is point which the friends should always bear in mind lest they deviate from the clear path indicated by the teachings god hath exempted women who are in their courses from obligatory prayer and fasting exemption from obligatory prayer and fasting is granted to women who are menstruating they should instead perform their ablutions see note and repeat times day between one noon and the next the verse“glorified be god the lord of splendor and beauty ”this provision has its antecedent in the arabic bayán where similar dispensation was granted in some earlier religious dispensations women in their courses were considered ritually unclean and were forbidden to observe the duties of prayer and fasting the concept of ritual uncleanness has been abolished by bahá’u’lláh see note the universal house of justice has clarified that the provisions in the kitáb aqdas granting exemptions from certain duties and responsibilities are as the word indicates exemptions and not prohibitions any believer is therefore free to avail himself or herself of an applicable exemption if he or she so wishes however the house of justice counsels that in deciding whether to do so or not the believer should use wisdom and realize that bahá’u’lláh has granted these exemptions for good reason the prescribed exemption from obligatory prayer originally related to the obligatory prayer consisting of nine rak‘ahs is now applicable to the three obligatory prayers which superseded it when traveling if ye should stop and rest in some safe spot perform ye—men and women alike—a single prostration in place of each unsaid obligatory prayer¶ exemption from obligatory prayer is granted to those who find themselves in such condition of insecurity that the saying of the obligatory prayers is not possible the exemption applies whether one is traveling or at home and it provides means whereby obligatory prayers which have remained unsaid on account of these insecure circumstances may be compensated for bahá’u’lláh has made it clear that obligatory prayer“is not suspended during travel”so long as one can find a“safe spot”in which to perform it numbers and in questions and answers amplify this provision upon completing your prostrations seat yourselves cross legged¶ the arabic expression “haykalu’t tawḥíd translated here as“cross legged ”means the “posture of unity it has traditionally signified cross legged position say god hath made my hidden love the key to the treasure¶ there is well known islamic tradition concerning god and his creation was hidden treasure wished to be made known and thus called creation into being in order that might be known references and allusions to this tradition are found throughout the bahá’í writings for example in one of his prayers bahá’u’lláh reveals lauded be thy name lord my god testify that thou wast hidden treasure wrapped within thine immemorial being and an impenetrable mystery enshrined in thine own essence wishing to reveal thyself thou didst call into being the greater and the lesser worlds and didst choose man above all thy creatures and didst make him sign of both of these worlds thou who art our lord the most compassionate thou didst raise him up to occupy thy throne before all the people of thy creation thou didst enable him to unravel thy mysteries and to shine with the lights of thine inspiration and thy revelation and to manifest thy names and thine attributes through him thou didst adorn the preamble of the book of thy creation thou who art the ruler of the universe thou hast fashioned prayers and meditations by bahá’u’lláh xxxviii likewise in the hidden words he states son of man loved thy creation hence created thee wherefore do thou love me that may name thy name and fill thy soul with the spirit of life ‘abdu’l‑bahá in his commentary on the above cited tradition wrote wayfarer in the path of the beloved know thou that the main purpose of this holy tradition is to make mention of the stages of god’s concealment and manifestation within the embodiments of truth they who are the dawning places of his all glorious being for example before the flame of the undying fire is lit and manifest it existeth by itself within itself in the hidden identity of the universal manifestations and this is the stage of the “hidden treasure and when the blessed tree is kindled by itself within itself and that divine fire burneth by its essence within its essence this is the stage of “i wished to be made known and when it shineth forth from the horizon of the universe with infinite divine names and attributes upon the contingent and placeless worlds this constituteth the emergence of new and wondrous creation which correspondeth to the stage of “thus called creation into being and when the sanctified souls rend asunder the veils of all earthly attachments and worldly conditions and hasten to the stage of gazing on the beauty of the divine presence and are honored by recognizing the manifestation and are able to witness the splendor of god’s most great sign in their hearts then will the purpose of creation which is the knowledge of him who is the eternal truth become manifest pen of the most high “pen of the most high ”“the supreme pen”and“the most exalted pen”are references to bahá’u’lláh illustrating his function as revealer of the word of god we have enjoined upon you fasting during brief period¶ fasting and obligatory prayer constitute the two pillars that sustain the revealed law of god bahá’u’lláh in one of his tablets affirms that he has revealed the laws of obligatory prayer and fasting so that through them the believers may draw nigh unto god shoghi effendi indicates that the fasting period which involves complete abstention from food and drink from sunrise till sunset is …essentially period of meditation and prayer of spiritual recuperation during which the believer must strive to make the necessary readjustments in his inner life and to refresh and reinvigorate the spiritual forces latent in his soul its significance and purpose are therefore fundamentally spiritual in character fasting is symbolic and reminder of abstinence from selfish and carnal desires fasting is enjoined on all the believers once they attain the age of and until they reach the age of years summary of the detailed provisions concerning the law of fasting and of the exemptions granted to certain categories of people is contained in the synopsis and codification section iv for discussion of the exemptions from fasting see notes and the nineteen day period of fasting coincides with the bahá’í month of ‘alá’ usually march immediately after the termination of the intercalary days see notes and and is followed by the feast of naw rúz see note and at its close have designated for you naw rúz as feast¶ the báb introduced new calendar known now as the badí‘ or bahá’í calendar see notes and according to this calendar day is the period from sunset to sunset in the bayán the báb ordained the month of ‘alá’ to be the month of fasting decreed that the day of naw rúz should mark the termination of that period and designated naw rúz as the day of god bahá’u’lláh confirms the badí‘ calendar wherein naw rúz is designated as feast naw rúz is the first day of the new year it coincides with the spring equinox in the northern hemisphere which usually occurs on march bahá’u’lláh explains that this feast day is to be celebrated on whatever day the sun passes into the constellation of aries the vernal equinox even should this occur one minute before sunset hence naw rúz could fall on or march depending on the time of the equinox bahá’u’lláh has left the details of many laws to be filled in by the universal house of justice among these are number of matters affecting the bahá’í calendar the guardian has stated that the implementation worldwide of the law concerning the timing of naw rúz will require the choice of particular spot on earth which will serve as the standard for the fixing of the time of the spring equinox he also indicated that the choice of this spot has been left to the decision of the universal house of justice let the days in excess of the months be placed before the month of fasting the badí‘ calendar is based on the solar year of days hours and odd minutes the year consists of months of days each days with the addition of four extra days five in leap year the báb did not specifically define the place for the intercalary days in the new calendar the kitáb aqdas resolves this question by assigning the“excess”days fixed position in the calendar immediately preceding the month of ‘alá’ the period of fasting for further details see the section on the bahá’í calendar inthe bahá’í world volume xviii we have ordained that these shall be the manifestations of the letter há¶ known as the ayyám há the days of há the intercalary days have the distinction of being associated with“the letter há ”the abjad numerical value of this arabic letter is five which corresponds to the potential number of intercalary days the letter “há” has been given several spiritual meanings in the holy writings among which is as symbol of the essence of god these days of giving that precede the season of restraint bahá’u’lláh enjoined upon his followers to devote these days to feasting rejoicing and charity in letter written on shoghi effendi’s behalf it is explained that “the intercalary days are specially set aside for hospitality the giving of gifts etc the traveler not bound by the fast¶ the minimum duration of journey which exempts the believer from fasting is defined by bahá’u’lláh and the details of this provision are summarized in the synopsis and codification section iv –v shoghi effendi has clarified that while travelers are exempt from fasting they are free to fast if they so wish he also indicated that the exemption applies during the whole period of one’s travel not just the hours one is in train or car etc the traveler the ailing those who are with child or giving suck are not bound by the fast they have been exempted by god as token of his grace exemption from fasting is granted to those who are ill or of advanced age see note women in their courses see note travelers see note and to women who are pregnant and those who are nursing this exemption is also extended to people who are engaged in heavy labor who at the same time are advised“to show respect to the law of god and for the exalted station of the fast”by eating“with frugality and in private” shoghi effendi has indicated that the types of work which would exempt people from the fast will be defined by the universal house of justice abstain from food and drink from sunrise to sundown¶ this relates to the period of fasting in one of his tablets ‘abdu’l‑bahá after stating that fasting consists of abstinence from food and drink further indicates that smoking is form of “drink in arabic the verb “drink” applies equally to smoking it hath been ordained that every believer in god shall each day repeat “alláh abhá” ninety five times “alláh abhá” is an arabic phrase meaning “god the all glorious it is form of the greatest name of god see note in islám there is tradition that among the many names of god one was the greatest however the identity of this greatest name was hidden bahá’u’lláh has confirmed that the greatest name is “bahá the various derivatives of the word “bahá” are also regarded as the greatest name shoghi effendi’s secretary writing on his behalf explains that the greatest name is the name of bahá’u’lláh “yá bahá’u’l abhá” is an invocation meaning “o thou glory of glories “alláh abhá” is greeting which means “god the all glorious both refer to bahá’u’lláh by greatest name is meant that bahá’u’lláh has appeared in god’s greatest name in other words that he is the supreme manifestation of god the greeting “alláh abhá” was adopted during the period of bahá’u’lláh’s exile in adrianople the repetition of “alláh abhá” ninety five times is to be preceded by the performance of ablutions see note perform ye ablutions for the obligatory prayer¶ ablutions are specifically associated with certain prayers they must precede the offering of the three obligatory prayers the daily recitation of “alláh abhá” ninety five times and the recital of the verse prescribed as an alternative to obligatory prayer and fasting for women in their courses see note the prescribed ablutions consist of washing the hands and the face in preparation for prayer in the case of the medium obligatory prayer this is accompanied by the recitation of certain verses see some texts revealed by bahá’u’lláh supplementary to the kitáb aqdas that ablutions have significance beyond washing may be seen from the fact that even should one have bathed oneself immediately before reciting the obligatory prayer it would still be necessary to perform ablutions when no water is available for ablutions prescribed verse is to be repeated five times see note and this provision is extended to those for whom the use of water would be physically harmful the detailed provisions of the law concerning ablutions are set out in the synopsis and codification section iv –g as well as in questions and answers numbers and ye have been forbidden to commit murder¶ the prohibition against taking another’s life is repeated by bahá’u’lláh in paragraph of the kitáb aqdas penalties are prescribed for premeditated murder see note in the case of manslaughter it is necessary to pay specified indemnity to the family of the deceased see kitáb aqdas or adultery¶ the arabic word “ziná here translated as“adultery ”signifies both fornication and adultery it applies not only to sexual relations between married person and someone who is not his or her spouse but also to extramarital sexual intercourse in general one form of “ziná” is rape the only penalty prescribed by bahá’u’lláh is for those who commit fornication see note penalties for other kinds of sexual offense are left to the universal house of justice to determine backbiting or calumny¶ backbiting slander and dwelling on the faults of others have been repeatedly condemned by bahá’u’lláh in the hidden words he clearly states “o son of being how couldst thou forget thine own faults and busy thyself with the faults of others whoso doeth this is accursed of me ”and again “o son of man breathe not the sins of others so long as thou art thyself sinner shouldst thou transgress this command accursed wouldst thou be and to this bear witness ”this strong admonition is further reiterated in his last work “the book of my covenant” “verily say the tongue is for mentioning what is good defile it not with unseemly talk god hath forgiven what is past henceforward everyone should utter that which is meet and seemly and should refrain from slander abuse and whatever causeth sadness in men we have divided inheritance into seven categories¶ the bahá’í laws of inheritance apply only in case of intestacy that is when the individual dies without leaving will in the kitáb aqdas bahá’u’lláh instructs every believer to write will he elsewhere clearly states that the individual has full jurisdiction over his property and is free to determine the manner in which his or her estate is to be divided and to designate in the will those whether bahá’í or non bahá’í who should inherit in this connection letter written on behalf of shoghi effendi explains that …even though bahá’í is permitted in his will to dispose of his wealth in the way he wishes yet he is morally and conscientiously bound to always bear in mind while writing his will the necessity of his upholding the principle of bahá’u’lláh regarding the social function of wealth and the consequent necessity of avoiding its overaccumulation and concentration in few individuals or groups of individuals this verse of the aqdas introduces lengthy passage in which bahá’u’lláh elaborates the bahá’í law of inheritance in reading this passage one should bear in mind that the law is formulated with the presumption that the deceased is man its provisions apply mutatis mutandis when the deceased is woman the system of inheritance which provides for distribution of the deceased’s estate among seven categories of heirs children spouse father mother brothers sisters and teachers is based on the provisions set out by the báb in the bayán the major features of the bahá’í laws of inheritance in the case of intestacy are if the deceased is father and his estate includes personal residence such residence passes to the eldest son if the deceased has no male descendants two thirds of the residence pass to his female descendants and the remaining third passes to the house of justice see note concerning the levels of the institution of the house of justice to which this law applies see also note the remainder of the estate is divided among the seven categories of heirs for details of the number of shares to be received by each group see questions and answers number and synopsis and codification section iv in case there is more than one heir in any category the share allotted to that class should be divided between them equally be they male or female in cases where there is no issue the share of the children reverts to the house of justice should one leave offspring but either part or all of the other categories of heirs be nonexistent two thirds of their shares revert to the offspring and one third to the house of justice should none of the specified categories exist two thirds of the estate revert to the nephews and nieces of the deceased if these do not exist the same shares revert to the aunts and uncles lacking these to their sons and daughters in any case the remaining third reverts to the house of justice should one leave none of the aforementioned heirs the entire estate reverts to the house of justice bahá’u’lláh states that non bahá’ís have no right to inherit from their bahá’í parents or relatives shoghi effendi in letter written on his behalf indicates that this restriction applies “only to such cases when bahá’í dies without leaving will and when therefore his property will have to be divided in accordance with the rules set forth in the aqdas otherwise bahá’í is free to bequeath his property to any person irrespective of religion provided however he leaves will specifying his wishes it is always possible therefore for bahá’í to provide for his or her non bahá’í partner children or relatives by leaving will additional details of the laws of inheritance are summarized in the synopsis and codification section iv –o to the brothers five parts to the sisters four parts¶ questions and answers amplifies the provisions of the law as it relates to the shares of the inheritance allocated to the brothers and sisters of the deceased if the brother or sister is from the same father as the deceased he or she will inherit his or her full allotted share if however the brother or sister is from another father he or she will inherit only two thirds of the allotted share the remaining one third reverting to the house of justice further in the case where the deceased has full brothers or full sisters among his heirs half brothers and half sisters from the mother’s side do not inherit the half brothers and half sisters will of course be due to receive inheritance from their own father’s estate the teachers¶ in tablet ‘abdu’l‑bahá compares teachers who are involved with the spiritual education of the child to the“spiritual father”who“endoweth his child with life everlasting ”he explains that this is the reason that“teachers are listed among the heirs”in the“law of god bahá’u’lláh specifies the conditions under which the teacher inherits and the share he or she receives when we heard the clamor of the children as yet unborn we doubled their share and decreased those of the rest in the báb’s laws of inheritance the children of the deceased were allotted nine parts consisting of shares this allocation constituted less than quarter of the whole estate bahá’u’lláh doubled their portion to shares and reduced those allotted to the other six categories of heirs he also outlines the precise intention of this verse and its implications for the distribution of the inheritance the house of justice¶ in referring to the house of justice in the kitáb aqdas bahá’u’lláh does not always explicitly distinguish between the universal house of justice and the local house of justice both of which institutions are ordained in that book he usually refers simply to“the house of justice ”leaving open for later clarification the level or levels of the whole institution to which each law would apply in tablet enumerating the revenues of the local treasury ‘abdu’l‑bahá includes those inheritances for which there are no heirs thus indicating that the house of justice referred to in these passages of the aqdas relating to inheritance is the local one should the deceased leave offspring but none of the other categories of heirs¶ bahá’u’lláh clarifies that“this ruling hath both general and specific application which is to say that whenever any category of this latter class of heirs is absent two thirds of their inheritance pass to the offspring and the remaining third to the house of justice” we have assigned the residence and personal clothing of the deceased to the male not female offspring nor to the other heirs in tablet ‘abdu’l‑bahá indicates that the residence and personal clothing of deceased man remain in the male line they pass to the eldest son and in the absence of the eldest son they pass to the second eldest son and so on he explains that this provision is an expression of the law of primogeniture which has invariably been upheld by the law of god in tablet to follower of the faith in persia he wrote “in all the divine dispensations the eldest son hath been given extraordinary distinctions even the station of prophethood hath been his birthright ”with the distinctions given to the eldest son however go concomitant duties for example he has the moral responsibility for the sake of god to care for his mother and also to consider the needs of the other heirs bahá’u’lláh clarifies various aspects of this part of the law of inheritance he specifies that if there be more than one residence the principal and most important one passes to the male offspring the remaining residences will together with the other possessions of the deceased have to be divided among the heirs and he indicates that in the absence of male offspring two thirds of the principal residence and the personal clothing of the deceased father will revert to the female issue and one third to the house of justice further when the deceased is woman bahá’u’lláh states that all her used clothing is to be equally divided amongst her daughters her unworn clothing jewels and property must be divided among her heirs as well as her used clothing if she leaves no daughter should the son of the deceased have passed away in the days of his father and have left children they will inherit their father’s share¶ this aspect of the law applies only in the case of the son who predeceases his father or mother if the daughter of the deceased be dead and leave issue her share will have to be divided according to the seven categories specified in the most holy book if the deceased should leave children who are under age their share of the inheritance must be entrusted to reliable individual¶ the word “amín translated in this paragraph as“reliable individual”and“trustee ”conveys in arabic wide range of meanings connected principally with the idea of trustworthiness but signifying also such qualities as reliability loyalty faithfulness uprightness honesty and so forth used in legal parlance “amín” denotes among other things trustee guarantor custodian guardian and keeper division of the estate should take place only after the ḥuqúqu’lláh hath been paid any debts have been settled the expenses of the funeral and burial defrayed¶ bahá’u’lláh specifies that the order of precedence for payment of these expenses is first the funeral and burial expenses then the debts of the deceased then the ḥuqúqu’lláh see note he also specifies that when applying the estate to these payment must first be made out of the residue of the estate and then if this is insufficient out of the residence and personal clothing of the deceased this is that hidden knowledge which shall never change since its beginning is with nine¶ in the arabic bayán the báb described his inheritance law as being“in accordance with hidden knowledge in the book of god—a knowledge that shall never change or be replaced ”he also stated that the numbers by which the division of the inheritance was expressed had been invested with significance intended to aid in the recognition of him whom god will make manifest the“nine”mentioned here is represented in the arabic text by the letter “ṭá which is its equivalent in the abjad notation see glossary it is the first element of the báb’s division of inheritance where he designates“nine parts”as the share of the children the significance of nine lies in its being the numerical equivalent of the greatest name “bahá alluded to in the next part of this verse as“the concealed and manifest the inviolable and unapproachably exalted name see also note the lord hath ordained that in every city house of justice be established¶ the institution of the house of justice consists of elected councils which operate at the local national and international levels of society bahá’u’lláh ordains both the universal house of justice and the local houses of justice in the kitáb aqdas ‘abdu’l‑bahá in his will and testament provides for the secondary national or regional houses of justice and outlines the method to be pursued for the election of the universal house of justice in the verse cited above the reference is to the local house of justice an institution which is to be elected in locality whenever there are nine or more resident adult bahá’ís for this purpose the definition of adult was temporarily fixed at the age of years by the guardian who indicated it was open to change by the universal house of justice in the future local and secondary houses of justice are for the present known as local spiritual assemblies and national spiritual assemblies shoghi effendi has indicated that this is “temporary appellation” which …as the position and aims of the bahá’í faith are better understood and more fully recognized will gradually be superseded by the permanent and more appropriate designation of house of justice not only will the present day spiritual assemblies be styled differently in future but they will be enabled also to add to their present functions those powers duties and prerogatives necessitated by the recognition of the faith of bahá’u’lláh not merely as one of the recognized religious systems of the world but as the state religion of an independent and sovereign power the number of bahá¶ the abjad numerical equivalent of “bahá” is nine the universal house of justice and the national and local spiritual assemblies currently have nine members each the minimum number prescribed by bahá’u’lláh it behooveth them to be the trusted ones of the merciful among men¶ the general powers and duties of the universal house of justice the national spiritual assemblies and the local spiritual assemblies and the qualifications for membership are set forth in the writings of bahá’u’lláh and ‘abdu’l‑bahá in the letters of shoghi effendi and in the elucidations of the universal house of justice the major functions of these institutions are outlined in the constitution of the universal house of justice and in those of the national and local spiritual assemblies take counsel together¶ bahá’u’lláh has established consultation as one of the fundamental principles of his faith and has exhorted the believers to“take counsel together in all matters ”he describes consultation as“the lamp of guidance which leadeth the way”and as“the bestower of understanding ”shoghi effendi states that the “principle of consultation constitutes one of the basic laws” of the bahá’í administrative order in questions and answers number bahá’u’lláh outlines an approach to consultation and stresses the importance of achieving unanimity in decision making failing which the majority decision must prevail the universal house of justice has clarified that this guidance concerning consultation was revealed before spiritual assemblies had been established and was in answer to question about the bahá’í teachings on consultation the house of justice affirms that the emergence of spiritual assemblies to which the friends may always turn for assistance in no way prohibits them from following the procedure outlined in questions and answers this approach may be used by the friends should they wish when they desire to consult on their personal problems build ye houses of worship throughout the lands¶ the bahá’í house of worship is dedicated to the praise of god the house of worship forms the central edifice of the mashriqu’l adhkár the dawning place of the praise of god complex which as it unfolds in the future will comprise in addition to the house of worship number of dependencies dedicated to social humanitarian educational and scientific pursuits ‘abdu’l‑bahá describes the mashriqu’l adhkár as“one of the most vital institutions in the world ”and shoghi effendi indicates that it exemplifies in tangible form the integration of “bahá’í worship and service anticipating the future development of this institution shoghi effendi envisages that the house of worship and its dependencies“shall afford relief to the suffering sustenance to the poor shelter to the wayfarer solace to the bereaved and education to the ignorant ”in the future bahá’í houses of worship will be constructed in every town and village the lord hath ordained that those of you who are able shall make pilgrimage to the sacred house¶ two sacred houses are covered by this ordinance the house of the báb inshíráz and the house of bahá’u’lláh in baghdád bahá’u’lláh has specified that pilgrimage to either of these two houses fulfills the requirement of this passage in two separate tablets known as súriy ḥajj bahá’u’lláh has prescribed specific rites for each of these pilgrimages in this sense the performance of pilgrimage is more than simply visiting these two houses after the passing of bahá’u’lláh ‘abdu’l‑bahá designated the shrine of bahá’u’lláh at bahjí as place of pilgrimage in tablet he indicates that the“most holy shrine the blessed house in baghdád and the venerated house of the báb inshíráz”are“consecrated to pilgrimage ”and that it is“obligatory”to visit these places“if one can afford it and is able to do so and if no obstacle stands in one’s way ”no rites have been prescribed for pilgrimage to the most holy shrine and from this he hath exempted women as mercy on his part¶ in the bayán the báb enjoined the ordinance of pilgrimage once in lifetime upon those of his followers who were financially able to undertake the journey he stated that the obligation was not binding on women in order to spare them the rigors of travel bahá’u’lláh likewise exempts women from his pilgrimage requirements the universal house of justice has clarified that this exemption is not prohibition and that women are free to perform the pilgrimage to engage in some occupation¶ it is obligatory for men and women to engage in trade or profession bahá’u’lláh exalts“engagement in such work”to the“rank of worship”of god the spiritual and practical significance of this law and the mutual responsibility of the individual and society for its implementation are explained in letter written on behalf of shoghi effendi with reference to bahá’u’lláh’s command concerning the engagement of the believers in some sort of profession the teachings are most emphatic on this matter particularly the statement in the aqdas to this effect which makes it quite clear that idle people who lack the desire to work can have no place in the new world order as corollary of this principle bahá’u’lláh further states that mendicity should not only be discouraged but entirely wiped out from the face of society it is the duty of those who are in charge of the organization of society to give every individual the opportunity of acquiring the necessary talent in some kind of profession and also the means of utilizing such talent both for its own sake and for the sake of earning the means of his livelihood every individual no matter how handicapped and limited he may be is under the obligation of engaging in some work or profession for work especially when performed in the spirit of service is according to bahá’u’lláh form of worship it has not only utilitarian purpose but has value in itself because it draws us nearer to god and enables us to better grasp his purpose for us in this world it is obvious therefore that the inheritance of wealth cannot make anyone immune from daily work in one of his tablets ‘abdu’l‑bahá states that“if person is incapable of earning living is stricken by dire poverty or becometh helpless then it is incumbent on the wealthy or the deputies to provide him with monthly allowance for his subsistence by ‘deputies’ is meant the representatives of the people that is to say the members of the house of justice see also note on mendicancy in response to question concerning whether bahá’u’lláh’s injunction requires wife and mother as well as her husband to work for livelihood the universal house of justice has explained that bahá’u’lláh’s directive is for the friends to be engaged in an occupation which will profit themselves and others and that homemaking is highly honorable and responsible work of fundamental importance to society concerning the retirement from work for individuals who have reached certain age shoghi effendi in letter written on his behalf stated that “this is matter on which the international house of justice will have to legislate as there are no provisions in the aqdas concerning it the kissing of hands hath been forbidden in the book in number of earlier religious dispensations and in certain cultures the kissing of the hand of religious figure or of prominent person was expected as mark of reverence and deference to such persons and as token of submission to their authority bahá’u’lláh prohibits the kissing of hands and in his tablets he also condemns such practices as prostrating oneself before another person and other forms of behavior that abase one individual in relation to another see note to none is it permitted to seek absolution from another soul¶ bahá’u’lláh prohibits confession to and seeking absolution of one’s sins from human being instead one should beg forgiveness from god in the tablet of bishárát he states that“such confession before people results in one’s humiliation and abasement ”and he affirms that god“wisheth not the humiliation of his servants shoghi effendi sets the prohibition into context his secretary has written on his behalf that we …are forbidden to confess to any person as do the catholics to their priests our sins and shortcomings or to do so in public as some religious sects do however if we spontaneously desire to acknowledge we have been wrong in something or that we have some fault of character and ask another person’s forgiveness or pardon we are quite free to do so the universal house of justice has also clarified that bahá’u’lláh’s prohibition concerning the confession of sins does not prevent an individual from admitting transgressions in the course of consultations held under the aegis of bahá’í institutions likewise it does not preclude the possibility of seeking advice from close friend or of professional counselor regarding such matters amongst the people is he who seateth himself amid the sandals by the door whilst coveting in his heart the seat of honor traditionally in the east it has been the practice to remove sandals and shoes before entering gathering the part of room farthest from the entrance is regarded as the head of the room and place of honor where the most prominent among those present are seated others sit in descending order towards the door by which the shoes and sandals have been left and where the most lowly would sit and among the people is he who layeth claim to inner knowledge¶ this is reference to people who claim access to esoteric knowledge and whose attachment to such knowledge veils them from the revelation of the manifestation of god elsewhere bahá’u’lláh affirms “they that are the worshipers of the idol which their imaginations have carved and who call it inner reality such men are in truth accounted among the heathen how many man hath secluded himself in the climes of india denied himself the things that god hath decreed as lawful imposed upon himself austerities and mortifications¶ these verses constitute the prohibition of monasticism and asceticism see the synopsis and codification section iv iii iv in the words of paradise bahá’u’lláh amplifies these provisions he states “living in seclusion or practicing asceticism is not acceptable in the presence of god ”and he calls upon those involved to“observe that which will cause joy and radiance ”he instructs those who have taken up“their abodes in the caves of the mountains”or who have“repaired to graveyards at night”to abandon these practices and he enjoins them not to deprive themselves of the“bounties”of this world which have been created by god for humankind and in the tablet of bishárát while acknowledging the“pious deeds”of monks and priests bahá’u’lláh calls upon them to“give up the life of seclusion and direct their steps towards the open world and busy themselves with that which will profit themselves and others ”he also grants them leave“to enter into wedlock that they may bring forth one who will make mention of god whoso layeth claim to revelation direct from god ere the expiration of full thousand years¶ the dispensation of bahá’u’lláh will last until the coming of the next manifestation of god whose advent will not take place before at least“a full thousand years”will have elapsed bahá’u’lláh cautions against ascribing to“this verse”anything other than its“obvious meaning ”and in one of his tablets he specifies that“each year”of this thousand year period consists of“twelve months according to the qur’án and of nineteen months of nineteen days each according to the bayán the intimation of his revelation to bahá’u’lláh in the síyáh chál of ṭihrán in october marks the birth of his prophetic mission and hence the commencement of the one thousand years or more that must elapse before the appearance of the next manifestation of god this is that of which we gave you forewarning when we were dwelling in ‘iráq then later while in the land of mystery and now from this resplendent spot the“land of mystery”refers to adrianople and“this resplendent spot”is reference to ‘akká amongst the people is he whose learning hath made him proud who when he heareth the tread of sandals following behind him waxeth greater in his own esteem¶ in the east the practice has been for followers of religious leader out of deference to walk pace or two behind him nimrod¶ the nimrod referred to in this verse is in both jewish and islamic traditions king who persecuted abraham and whose name became symbolic of great pride aghṣán¶ “aghṣán” plural ofghuṣn is the arabic word for “branches this term is used by bahá’u’lláh to designate his male descendants it has particular implications not only for the disposition of endowments but also for the succession of authority following the passing of bahá’u’lláh see note and of ‘abdu’l‑bahá bahá’u’lláh in the book of his covenant appointed ‘abdu’l‑bahá his eldest son as the center of his covenant and the head of the faith ‘abdu’l‑bahá in his will and testament appointed shoghi effendi his eldest grandson as the guardian and head of the faith this passage of the aqdas therefore anticipates the succession of chosen aghṣán and thus the institution of the guardianship and envisages the possibility of break in their line the passing of shoghi effendi in precipitated the very situation provided for in this passage in that the line of aghṣán ended before the universal house of justice had been established see note revert to the people of bahá¶ bahá’u’lláh provides for the possibility that the line of aghṣán would terminate prior to the establishment of the universal house of justice he designated that in such situation“endowments shall revert to the people of bahá ”the term“people of bahá”is used with number of different meanings in the bahá’í writings in this instance they are described as those“who speak not except by his leave and judge not save in accordance with what god hath decreed in this tablet ”following the passing of shoghi effendi in the hands of the cause of god directed the affairs of the cause until the election of the universal house of justice in see note shave not your heads¶ in some religious traditions it is considered desirable to shave one’s head the shaving of the head is forbidden by bahá’u’lláh and he makes it clear that the provision contained in his súriy ḥajj requiring pilgrims to the holy house inshíráz to shave their heads has been superseded through this verse of the kitáb aqdas it is not seemly to let the hair pass beyond the limit of the ears¶ shoghi effendi has made clear that unlike the prohibition on shaving the head this law forbidding the growing of the hair beyond the lobe of the ear pertains only to men the application of this law will require clarification by the universal house of justice exile and imprisonment are decreed for the thief¶ bahá’u’lláh states that the determination of the degree of penalty in accordance with the seriousness of the offense rests with the house of justice the punishments for theft are intended for future condition of society when they will be supplemented and applied by the universal house of justice on the third offense place ye mark upon his brow so that thus identified he may not be accepted in the cities of god and his countries¶ the mark to be placed on the thief’s forehead serves the purpose of warning people of his proclivities all details concerning the nature of the mark how the mark is to be applied how long it must be worn on what conditions it may be removed as well as the seriousness of various degrees of theft have been left by bahá’u’lláh for the universal house of justice to determine when the law is applied whoso wisheth to make use of vessels of silver and gold is at liberty to do so in the bayán the báb allowed the use of gold and silver utensils thus abrogating the islamic condemnation of their use which stems not from an explicit injunction of the qur’án but from muslim traditions bahá’u’lláh here confirms the báb’s ruling take heed lest when partaking of food ye plunge your hands into the contents of bowls and platters this prohibition was defined by shoghi effendi as “plunging one’s hand in food in many parts of the world it has been customary to eat with the hands from communal bowl adopt ye such usages as are most in keeping with refinement this is the first of several passages referring to the importance of refinement and cleanliness the original arabic word “laṭáfah” rendered here as“refinement ”has wide range of meanings with both spiritual and physical implications such as elegance gracefulness cleanliness civility politeness gentleness delicacy and graciousness as well as being subtle refined sanctified and pure in accordance with the context of the various passages where it occurs in the kitáb aqdas it has been translated either as “refinement” or “cleanliness he who is the dawning place of god’s cause hath no partner in the most great infallibility in the tablet of ishráqát bahá’u’lláh affirms that the most great infallibility is confined to the manifestations of god chapter insome answered questionsis devoted to an explanation by ‘abdu’l‑bahá of this verse of the aqdas in this chapter he stresses among other things the inseparability of essential“infallibility”from the manifestations of god and asserts that“whatever emanates from them is identical with the truth and conformable to reality ”that“they are not under the shadow of the former laws ”and“whatever they say is the word of god and whatever they perform is an upright action unto every father hath been enjoined the instruction of his son and daughter in the art of reading and writing¶ ‘abdu’l‑bahá in his tablets not only calls attention to the responsibility of parents to educate all their children but he also clearly specifies that the“training and culture of daughters is more necessary than that of sons ”for girls will one day be mothers and mothers are the first educators of the new generation if it is not possible therefore for family to educate all the children preference is to be accorded to daughters since through educated mothers the benefits of knowledge can be most effectively and rapidly diffused throughout society god hath imposed fine on every adulterer and adulteress to be paid to the house of justice¶ although the term translated here as adultery refers in its broadest sense to unlawful sexual intercourse between either married or unmarried individuals see note for definition of the term ‘abdu’l‑bahá has specified that the punishment here prescribed is for sexual intercourse between persons who are unmarried he indicates that it remains for the universal house of justice to determine the penalty for adultery committed by married individual see also in one of his tablets ‘abdu’l‑bahá refers to some of the spiritual and social implications of the violation of the laws of morality and concerning the penalty here described he indicates that the aim of this law is to make clear to all that such an action is shameful in the eyes of god and that in the event that the offense can be established and the fine imposed the principal purpose is the exposure of the offenders—that they are shamed and disgraced in the eyes of society he affirms that such exposure is in itself the greatest punishment the house of justice referred to in this verse is presumably the local house of justice currently known as the local spiritual assembly nine mithqáls of gold to be doubled if they should repeat the offense¶ mithqál is unit of weight the weight of the traditional mithqál used in the middle east is equivalent to nakhuds however the mithqál used by the bahá’ís consists of nakhuds “in accordance with the specification of the bayán” the weight of nine of these mithqál equals grams or troy ounces in relation to the application of the fine bahá’u’lláh clearly specifies that each succeeding fine is double the preceding one thus the fine imposed increases in geometrical progression the imposition of this fine is intended for future condition of society at which time the law will be supplemented and applied by the universal house of justice we have made it lawful for you to listen to music and singing ‘abdu’l‑bahá has written that“among certain nations of the east music was considered reprehensible ”though the qur’án contains no specific guidance on the subject some muslims consider listening to music as unlawful while others tolerate music within certain bounds and subject to particular conditions there are number of passages in the bahá’í writings in praise of music ‘abdu’l‑bahá for example asserts that“music sung or played is spiritual food for soul and heart ye men of justice it has been elucidated in the writings of ‘abdu’l‑bahá and shoghi effendi that while the membership of the universal house of justice is confined to men both women and men are eligible for election to secondary and local houses of justice currently designated as national and local spiritual assemblies the penalties for wounding or striking person depend upon the severity of the injury for each degree the lord of judgment hath prescribed certain indemnity while bahá’u’lláh specified that the extent of the penalty depends upon“the severity of the injury ”there is no record of his having set out the details of the size of the indemnity with regard to each degree of offense the responsibility to determine these devolves upon the universal house of justice verily it is enjoined upon you to offer feast once in every month¶ this injunction has become the basis for the holding of monthly bahá’í festivities and as such constitutes the ordination of the nineteen day feast in the arabic bayán the báb called upon his followers to gather together once every nineteen days to show hospitality and fellowship bahá’u’lláh here confirms this and notes the unifying role of such occasions ‘abdu’l‑bahá and shoghi effendi after him have gradually unfolded the institutional significance of this injunction ‘abdu’l‑bahá emphasized the importance of the spiritual and devotional character of these gatherings shoghi effendi besides further elaborating the devotional and social aspects of the feast has developed the administrative element of such gatherings and in systematically instituting the feast has provided for period of consultation on the affairs of the bahá’í community including the sharing of news and messages in answer to question as to whether this injunction is obligatory bahá’u’lláh stated it was not shoghi effendi in letter written on his behalf further comments attendance at nineteen day feasts is not obligatory but very important and every believer should consider it duty and privilege to be present on such occasions if ye should hunt with beasts or birds of prey invoke ye the name of god when ye send them to pursue their quarry for then whatever they catch shall be lawful unto you even should ye find it to have died by this law bahá’u’lláh greatly simplifies practices and religious regulations of the past relating to hunting he has also stated that hunting with such weapons as bows and arrows guns and the like is included in this ruling but that the consumption of game if it is found dead in trap or net is prohibited hunt not to excess¶ while hunting is not forbidden by bahá’u’lláh he warns against excessive hunting the universal house of justice will in due course have to consider what constitutes an excess in hunting he hath granted them no right to the property of others the injunction to show kindness to bahá’u’lláh’s kindred does not give them share in the property of others this is in contrast toshí‘ih muslim practice in which lineal descendants of muḥammad are entitled to receive share of certain tax should anyone intentionally destroy house by fire him also shall ye burn should anyone deliberately take another’s life him also shall ye put to death the law of bahá’u’lláh prescribes the death penalty for murder and arson with the alternative of life imprisonment see note in his tablets ‘abdu’l‑bahá explains the difference between revenge and punishment he affirms that individuals do not have the right to take revenge that revenge is despised in the eyes of god and that the motive for punishment is not vengeance but the imposition of penalty for the committed offense insome answered questions he confirms that it is the right of society to impose punishments on criminals for the purpose of protecting its members and defending its existence with regard to this provision shoghi effendi in letter written on his behalf gives the following explanation in the aqdas bahá’u’lláh has given death as the penalty for murder however he has permitted life imprisonment as an alternative both practices would be in accordance with his laws some of us may not be able to grasp the wisdom of this when it disagrees with our own limited vision but we must accept it knowing his wisdom his mercy and his justice are perfect and for the salvation of the entire world if man were falsely condemned to die can we not believe almighty god would compensate him thousandfold in the next world for this human injustice you cannot give up salutary law just because on rare occasions the innocent may be punished the details of the bahá’í law of punishment for murder and arson law designed for future state of society were not specified by bahá’u’lláh the various details of the law such as degrees of offense whether extenuating circumstances are to be taken into account and which of the two prescribed punishments is to be the norm are left to the universal house of justice to decide in light of prevailing conditions when the law is to be in operation the manner in which the punishment is to be carried out is also left to the universal house of justice to decide in relation to arson this depends on what“house”is burned there is obviously tremendous difference in the degree of offense between the person who burns down an empty warehouse and one who sets fire to school full of children should ye condemn the arsonist and the murderer to life imprisonment it would be permissible according to the provisions of the book shoghi effendi in response to question about this verse of the aqdas affirmed that while capital punishment is permitted an alternative “life imprisonment has been provided “whereby the rigors of such condemnation can be seriously mitigated he states that “bahá’u’lláh has given us choice and has therefore left us free to use our own discretion within certain limitations imposed by his law in the absence of specific guidance concerning the application of this aspect of bahá’í law it remains for the universal house of justice to legislate on the matter in the future god hath prescribed matrimony unto you bahá’u’lláh in one of his tablets states that god in establishing this law has made marriage“a fortress for well being and salvation the synopsis and codification section iv –o summarizes and synthesizes the provisions in the kitáb aqdas and questions and answers concerning marriage and the conditions under which it is permitted and the law of betrothal the payment of the dowry and the procedures to be adopted in the event of the prolonged absence of spouse and and sundry other circumstances and see also notes beware that ye take not unto yourselves more wives than two whoso contenteth himself with single partner from among the maidservants of god both he and she shall live in tranquillity while the text of the kitáb aqdas appears to permit bigamy bahá’u’lláh counsels that tranquillity and contentment derive from monogamy in another tablet he underlines the importance of the individual’s acting in such way as to“bring comfort to himself and to his partner ”‘abdu’l‑bahá the authorized interpreter of the bahá’í writings states that in the text of the aqdas monogamy is in effect enjoined he elaborates this theme in number of tablets including the following know thou that polygamy is not permitted under the law of god for contentment with one wife hath been clearly stipulated taking second wife is made dependent upon equity and justice being upheld between the two wives under all conditions however observance of justice and equity towards two wives is utterly impossible the fact that bigamy has been made dependent upon an impossible condition is clear proof of its absolute prohibition therefore it is not permissible for man to have more than one wife polygamy is very ancient practice among the majority of humanity the introduction of monogamy has been only gradually accomplished by the manifestations of god jesus for example did not prohibit polygamy but abolished divorce except in the case of fornication muḥammad limited the number of wives to four but making plurality of wives contingent on justice and reintroducing permission for divorce bahá’u’lláh who was revealing his teachings in the milieu of muslim society introduced the question of monogamy gradually in accordance with the principles of wisdom and the progressive unfoldment of his purpose the fact that he left his followers with an infallible interpreter of his writings enabled him to outwardly permit two wives in the kitáb aqdas but uphold condition that enabled ‘abdu’l‑bahá to elucidate later that the intention of the law was to enforce monogamy he who would take into his service maid may do so with propriety¶ bahá’u’lláh states that man may employ maiden for domestic service this was not permissible undershí‘ih muslim practice unless the employer entered into marriage contract with her bahá’u’lláh emphasizes that the“service”referred to in this verse is solely“such as is performed by any other class of servants be they young or old in exchange for wages” an employer has no sexual rights over his maid she is“free to choose husband at whatever time she pleaseth ”for the purchase of women is forbidden this is my bidding unto you hold fast to it as an assistance to yourselves while marriage is enjoined in the kitáb aqdas bahá’u’lláh clarifies that it is not obligatory shoghi effendi in letter written on his behalf also declared that “marriage is by no means an obligation and he affirmed that “in the last resort it is for the individual to decide whether he wishes to lead family life or live in state of celibacy if person has to wait considerable period of time before finding spouse or ultimately must remain single it does not mean that the individual is thereby unable to fulfill his or her life’s purpose which is fundamentally spiritual we have conditioned it upon the permission of their parents¶ in letter written on his behalf shoghi effendi has commented on this provision of the law bahá’u’lláh has clearly stated the consent of all living parents is required for bahá’í marriage this applies whether the parents are bahá’ís or non bahá’ís divorced for years or not this great law he has laid down to strengthen the social fabric to knit closer the ties of the home to place certain gratitude and respect in the hearts of the children for those who have given them life and sent their souls out on the eternal journey towards their creator no marriage may be contracted without payment of dowry¶ the synopsis and codification section iv –v summarizes the main provisions concerning the dowry these provisions have their antecedents in the bayán the dowry is to be paid by the bridegroom to the bride it is fixed at mithqáls of pure gold for city dwellers and mithqáls of silver for village dwellers see note bahá’u’lláh indicates that if at the time of the wedding the bridegroom is unable to pay the dowry in full it is permissible for him to issue promissory note to the bride with the revelation of bahá’u’lláh many familiar concepts customs and institutions are redefined and take on new meaning one of these is the dowry the institution of dowry is very ancient practice in many cultures and takes many forms in some countries it is payment made by the parents of the bride to the bridegroom in others it is payment made by the bridegroom to the parents of the bride called “bride price in both such cases the amount is often quite considerable the law of bahá’u’lláh abolishes all such variants and converts the dowry into symbolic act whereby the bridegroom presents gift of certain limited value to the bride for city dwellers at nineteen mithqáls of pure gold and for village dwellers at the same amount in silver¶ bahá’u’lláh specifies that the criterion for determining the dowry payment is the location of the permanent residence of the bridegroom not of the bride whoso wisheth to increase this sum it is forbidden him to exceed the limit of ninety five mithqáls if he content himself however with payment of the lowest level it shall be better for him according to the book in answer to question about the dowry bahá’u’lláh stated whatever is revealed in the bayán in respect to those residing in cities and villages is approved and should be carried out however in the kitáb aqdas mention is made of the lowest level the intention is nineteen mithqáls of silver specified in the bayán for village dwellers this is more pleasing unto god provided the two parties agree the purpose is to promote the comfort of all and to bring about concord and union among the people therefore the greater the consideration shown in these matters the better it will be the people of bahá must associate and deal with each other with the utmost love and sincerity they should be mindful of the interests of all especially the friends of god ‘abdu’l‑bahá in one of his tablets summarized some of the provisions for determining the level of the dowry the unit of payment mentioned in the extract cited below is the “váḥid one váḥid is equivalent to nineteen mithqáls he stated city dwellers must pay in gold and village dwellers in silver it dependeth on the financial means at the disposal of the groom if he is poor he payeth one váḥid if of modest means he payeth two váḥids if well to do three váḥids if wealthy four váḥids and if very rich he giveth five váḥids it is in truth matter for agreement between the bridegroom the bride and their parents whatever agreement is reached should be carried out in this same tablet ‘abdu’l‑bahá encouraged the believers to refer questions concerning the application of this law to the universal house of justice which has“the authority to legislate ”he stressed that“it is this body which will enact laws and legislate upon secondary matters which are not explicit in the holy text should any one of his servants intend to travel he must fix for his wife time when he will return home¶ if the husband leaves without informing his wife of the date of his return and no news of him reaches her and all trace of him is lost bahá’u’lláh has stated that should the husband have been aware of the law prescribed in the kitáb aqdas the wife may remarry after waiting full year if however the husband was unaware of the law the wife must wait until news of her husband reaches her it behooveth her to wait for period of nine months after which there is no impediment to her taking another husband¶ in the event of the husband’s failure either to return at the end of the specified period of time or to notify his wife of delay the wife must wait nine months after which she is free to remarry though it is preferable for her to wait longer see note for the bahá’í calendar bahá’u’lláh states that in such circumstances should news reach the wife of“her husband’s death or murder ”she must also wait nine months prior to remarrying ‘abdu’l‑bahá in tablet has further clarified that the nine months’ waiting period following news of the husband’s death applies only if the husband had been away at the time of his death and not if he dies while at home she should choose the course that is praiseworthy¶ bahá’u’lláh defines“the course that is praiseworthy”as“the exercise of patience” two just witnesses¶ bahá’u’lláh sets out“the criterion of justness”in relation to witnesses as“a good reputation among the people ”he states that it is not necessary that the witnesses should be bahá’ís since“the testimony of all god’s servants of whatever faith or creed is acceptable before his throne” should resentment or antipathy arise between husband and wife he is not to divorce her but to bide in patience throughout the course of one whole year¶ divorce is strongly condemned in the bahá’í teachings if however antipathy or resentment develop between the marriage partners divorce is permissible after the lapse of one full year during this year of patience the husband is obliged to provide for the financial support of his wife and children and the couple is urged to strive to reconcile their differences shoghi effendi affirms that both the husband and wife “have equal right to ask for divorce” whenever either partner “feels it absolutely essential to do so in questions and answers bahá’u’lláh elaborates number of issues concerning the year of patience its observance establishing the date of its beginning and the conditions for reconciliation and the role of witnesses and the local house of justice and in relation to the witnesses the universal house of justice has clarified that in these days the duties of the witnesses in cases of divorce are performed by the spiritual assemblies the detailed provisions of the bahá’í laws on divorce are summarized in the synopsis and codification section iv –i the lord hath prohibited the practice to which ye formerly had recourse when thrice ye had divorced woman this relates to law of islám set out in the qur’án which decreed that under certain conditions man could not remarry his divorced wife unless she had married and been divorced by another man bahá’u’lláh affirms that this is the practice which has been prohibited in the kitáb aqdas he who hath divorced his wife may choose upon the passing of each month to remarry her when there is mutual affection and consent so long as she hath not taken another husband unless clearly her circumstances change shoghi effendi states in letter written on his behalf that the intention of “the passing of each month” is not to impose limitation and that it is possible for divorced couple to remarry at any time after their divorce so long as neither party is currently married to another person semen is not unclean¶ in number of religious traditions and inshí‘ih muslim practice semen has been declared ritually unclean bahá’u’lláh has here dispelled this concept see also note below cleave ye unto the cord of refinement¶ ‘abdu’l‑bahá refers to the effect of“purity and holiness cleanliness and refinement”on the exaltation of“the human condition”and“the development of man’s inner reality ”he states “the fact of having pure and spotless body exercises an influence upon the spirit of man see also note wash ye every soiled thing with water that hath undergone no alteration in any one of the three respects¶ the“three respects”referred to in this verse are changes in the color taste or smell of the water bahá’u’lláh provides additional guidance concerning pure water and the point at which it is considered unsuitable for use god hath abolished the concept of “uncleanness whereby divers things and peoples have been held to be impure the concept of ritual “uncleanness as understood and practiced in some tribal societies and in the religious communities of certain earlier dispensations has been abolished by bahá’u’lláh he states that through his revelation“all created things were immersed in the sea of purification see also notes and first day of riḍván¶ this is reference to the arrival of bahá’u’lláh and his companions in the najíbíyyih garden outside the city of baghdád subsequently referred to by the bahá’ís as the garden of riḍván this event which took place thirty one days after naw rúz in april signalized the commencement of the period during which bahá’u’lláh declared his mission to his companions in tablet he refers to his declaration as“the day of supreme felicity”and he describes the garden of riḍván as“the spot from which he shed upon the whole of creation the splendors of his name the all merciful ”bahá’u’lláh spent twelve days in this garden prior to departing for istanbul the place to which he had been banished the declaration of bahá’u’lláh is celebrated annually by the twelve day riḍván festival described by shoghi effendi as “the holiest and most significant of all bahá’í festivals” see notes and the bayán¶ the bayán the mother book of the bábí dispensation is the title given by the báb to his book of laws and it is also applied to the entire body of his writings the persian bayán is the major doctrinal work and principal repository of the laws ordained by the báb the arabic bayán is parallel in content but smaller and less weighty when describing the persian bayán in god passes by shoghi effendi indicated that it should be regarded “primarily as eulogy of the promised one rather than code of laws and ordinances designed to be permanent guide to future generations” ‘abdu’l‑bahá has written “the bayán hath been superseded by the kitáb aqdas except in respect of such laws as have been confirmed and mentioned in the kitáb aqdas the destruction of books¶ in the tablet of ishráqát bahá’u’lláh referring to the fact that the báb had made the laws of the bayán subject to his sanction states that he put some of the báb’s laws into effect“by embodying them in the kitáb aqdas in different words ”while others he set aside with regard to the destruction of books the bayán commanded the báb’s followers to destroy all books except those that were written in vindication of the cause and religion of god bahá’u’lláh abrogates this specific law of the bayán as to the nature and severity of the laws of the bayán shoghi effendi in letter written on his behalf provides the following comment the severe laws and injunctions revealed by the báb can be properly appreciated and understood only when interpreted in the light of his own statements regarding the nature purpose and character of his own dispensation as these statements clearly reveal the bábí dispensation was essentially in the nature of religious and indeed social revolution and its duration had therefore to be short but full of tragic events of sweeping and drastic reforms those drastic measures enforced by the báb and his followers were taken with the view of undermining the very foundations ofshí‘ih orthodoxy and thus paving the way for the coming of bahá’u’lláh to assert the independence of the new dispensation and to prepare also the ground for the approaching revelation of bahá’u’lláh the báb had therefore to reveal very severe laws even though most of them were never enforced but the mere fact that he revealed them was in itself proof of the independent character of his dispensation and was sufficient to create such widespread agitation and excite such opposition on the part of the clergy that led them to cause his eventual martyrdom we have permitted you to read such sciences as are profitable unto you not such as end in idle disputation¶ the bahá’í writings enjoin the acquisition of knowledge and the study of the arts and sciences bahá’ís are admonished to respect people of learning and accomplishment and are warned against the pursuit of studies that are productive only of futile wrangling in his tablets bahá’u’lláh counsels the believers to study such sciences and arts as are“useful”and would further“the progress and advancement”of society and he cautions against sciences which“begin with words and end with words ”the pursuit of which leads to“idle disputation ”shoghi effendi in letter written on his behalf likened sciences that begin with words and end with words to “fruitless excursions into metaphysical hair splittings and in another letter he explained that what bahá’u’lláh primarily intended by such “sciences” are “those theological treatises and commentaries that encumber the human mind rather than help it to attain the truth he who held converse with god¶ this is traditional jewish and islamic title of moses bahá’u’lláh states that with the coming of his revelation“human ears have been privileged to hear what he who conversed with god heard upon sinai sinai¶ the mountain where the law was revealed by god to moses the spirit of god¶ this is one of the titles used in the islamic and bahá’í writings to designate jesus christ carmel zion¶ carmel the “vineyard of god is the mountain in the holy land where the shrine of the báb and the seat of the world administrative center of the faith are situated zion is hill in jerusalem the traditional site of the tomb of king david and is symbolic of jerusalem as holy city the crimson ark¶ the“crimson ark”refers to the cause of bahá’u’lláh his followers are designated as the“companions of the crimson ark ”lauded by the báb in the qayyúmu’l asmá’ emperor of austria he who is the dayspring of god’s light dwelt in the prison of ‘akká at the time when thou didst set forth to visit the aqṣá mosque francis joseph franz josef emperor of austria and king of hungary made pilgrimage to jerusalem in while in the holy land he failed to take the opportunity to inquire about bahá’u’lláh who at that time was prisoner in ‘akká acre the aqṣá mosque literally the “most distant” mosque is referred to in the qur’án and has become identified with the temple mount in jerusalem king of berlin kaiser william wilhelm friedrich ludwig the seventh king of prussia was acclaimed first emperor of germany in january at versailles in france following the victory of germany over france in the franco prussian war the one whose power transcended thy power and whose station excelled thy station¶ this is reference to napoleon iii the emperor of the french who was regarded by many historians as the most outstanding monarch of his day in the west bahá’u’lláh addressed two tablets to napoleon iii in the second of which he clearly prophesied that napoleon’s kingdom would be“thrown into confusion ”that his“empire shall pass”from his hands and that his people would experience great“commotions within year napoleon iii suffered resounding defeat at the hands of kaiser william at the battle of sedan in he went in exile to england where he died three years later people of constantinople the word here translated as“constantinople”is in the original “ar rúm” or “rome this term has generally been used in the middle east to designate constantinople and the eastern roman empire then the city of byzantium and its empire and later the ottoman empire spot that art situate on the shores of the two seas this is reference to constantinople now called istanbul located on the bosporus strait about kilometers long which links the black sea and the sea of marmara it is the largest city and seaport of turkey constantinople was the capital of the ottoman empire from until during bahá’u’lláh’s sojourn in this city the tyrannical sultan ‘abdu’l ‘azíz occupied the throne the ottoman sultans were also the caliphs the leaders of sunní islám bahá’u’lláh anticipated the fall of the caliphate which was abolished in banks of the rhine in one of his tablets written before the first world war ‘abdu’l‑bahá explained that bahá’u’lláh’s reference to having seen the banks of the rhine“covered with gore”related to the franco prussian war and that there was more suffering to come ingod passes byshoghi effendi states that the “oppressively severe treaty” that was imposed on germany following its defeat in the first world war “provoked‘the lamentations of berlin which half century before had been ominously prophesied land of ṭá¶ “ṭá” is the initial letter of ṭihrán the capital of iran bahá’u’lláh has often chosen to represent certain place names by reference to their initial letter according to the abjad system of reckoning the numerical value of ṭá is nine which equals the numerical value of the name bahá within thee was born the manifestation of his glory¶ this is reference to the birth of bahá’u’lláh in ṭihrán on november land ofkhá reference to the iranian province ofkhurásán and neighboring areas which include the city of ‘ishqábád ashkhabad should anyone acquire one hundred mithqáls of gold nineteen mithqáls thereof are god’s and to be rendered unto him¶ this verse establishes ḥuqúqu’lláh the right of god the offering of fixed portion of the value of the believer’s possessions this offering was made to bahá’u’lláh as the manifestation of god and then following his ascension to ‘abdu’l‑bahá as the center of the covenant in his will and testament ‘abdu’l‑bahá provided that the ḥuqúqu’lláh was to be offered“through the guardian of the cause of god ”there now being no guardian it is offered through the universal house of justice as the head of the faith this fund is used for the promotion of the faith of god and its interests as well as for various philanthropic purposes the offering of the ḥuqúqu’lláh is spiritual obligation the fulfillment of which has been left to the conscience of each bahá’í while the community is reminded of the requirements of the law of ḥuqúq no believer may be approached individually to pay it number of items in questions and answers further elaborate this law the payment of ḥuqúqu’lláh is based on the calculation of the value of the individual’s possessions if person has possessions equal in value to at least nineteen mithqáls of gold it is spiritual obligation to pay nineteen percent of the total amount once only as ḥuqúqu’lláh thereafter whenever one’s income after all expenses have been paid increases the value of one’s possessions by the amount of at least nineteen mithqáls of gold one is to pay nineteen percent of this increase and so on for each further increase certain categories of possessions such as one’s residence are exempt from the payment of ḥuqúqu’lláh and specific provisions are outlined to cover cases of financial loss the failure of investments to yield profit and for the payment of ḥuqúq in the event of the person’s death in this latter case see note extensive extracts from tablets questions and answers and other writings concerning the spiritual significance of ḥuqúqu’lláh and the details of its application have been published in compilation entitledḥuqúqu’lláh various petitions have come before our throne from the believers concerning laws from god we have in consequence revealed this holy tablet and arrayed it with the mantle of his law that haply the people may keep the commandments of their lord “for number of years ”bahá’u’lláh states in one of his tablets “petitions reached the most holy presence from various lands begging for the laws of god but we held back the pen ere the appointed time had come ”not until twenty years from the birth of his prophetic mission in the síyáh chál of ṭihrán had elapsed did bahá’u’lláh reveal the kitáb aqdas the repository of the laws of his dispensation even after its revelation the aqdas was withheld by him for some time before it was sent to the friends in persia this divinely purposed delay in the revelation of the basic laws of god for this age and the subsequent gradual implementation of their provisions illustrate the principle of progressive revelation which applies even within the ministry of each prophet crimson spot¶ this is reference to the prison city of ‘akká in the bahá’í writings the word “crimson” is used in several allegorical and symbolic senses see also note the sadratu’l muntahá¶ literally “the furthermost lote tree translated by shoghi effendi as“the tree beyond which there is no passing ”this is used as symbol in islám for example in the accounts of muḥammad’s night journey to mark the point in the heavens beyond which neither men nor angels can pass in their approach to god and thus to delimit the bounds of divine knowledge as revealed to mankind hence it is often used in the bahá’í writings to designate the manifestation of god himself see also note the mother book¶ the term “mother book” is generally used to designate the central book of religious dispensation in the qur’án and islamic ḥadíth the term is used to describe the qur’án itself in the bábí dispensation the bayán is the mother book and the kitáb aqdas is the mother book of the dispensation of bahá’u’lláh further the guardian in letter written on his behalf has stated that this concept can also be used as “collective term indicating the body of the teachings revealed by bahá’u’lláh this term is also used in broader sense to signify the divine repository of revelation whoso interpreteth what hath been sent down from the heaven of revelation and altereth its evident meaning¶ in several of his tablets bahá’u’lláh affirms the distinction between allegorical verses which are susceptible to interpretation and those verses that relate to such subjects as the laws and ordinances worship and religious observances whose meanings are evident and which demand compliance on the part of the believers as explained in notes and bahá’u’lláh designated ‘abdu’l‑bahá his eldest son as his successor and the interpreter of his teachings ‘abdu’l‑bahá in his turn appointed his eldest grandson shoghi effendi to succeed him as interpreter of the holy writ and guardian of the cause the interpretations of ‘abdu’l‑bahá and shoghi effendi are considered divinely guided and are binding on the bahá’ís the existence of authoritative interpretations does not preclude the individual from engaging in the study of the teachings and thereby arriving at personal interpretation or understanding clear distinction is however drawn in the bahá’í writings between authoritative interpretation and the understanding that each individual arrives at from study of its teachings individual interpretations based on person’s understanding of the teachings constitute the fruit of man’s rational power and may well contribute to greater comprehension of the faith such views nevertheless lack authority in presenting their personal ideas individuals are cautioned not to discard the authority of the revealed words not to deny or contend with the authoritative interpretation and not to engage in controversy rather they should offer their thoughts as contribution to knowledge making it clear that their views are merely their own approach not the public pools of persian baths¶ bahá’u’lláh prohibits the use of the pools found in the traditional public bathhouses of persia in these baths it was the custom for many people to wash themselves in the same pool and for the water to be changed at infrequent intervals consequently the water was discolored befouled and unhygienic and had highly offensive stench avoid ye likewise the malodorous pools in the courtyards of persian homes¶ most houses in persia used to have pool in their courtyard which served as reservoir for water used for cleaning washing and other domestic purposes since the water in the pool was stagnant and was not usually changed for weeks at time it tended to develop very unpleasant odor it is forbidden you to wed your fathers’ wives marriage with one’s stepmother is here explicitly prohibited this prohibition also applies to marrying one’s stepfather where bahá’u’lláh has expressed law between man and woman it appliesmutatis mutandisas between woman and man unless the context should make this impossible ‘abdu’l‑bahá and shoghi effendi confirmed that while stepmothers are the only category of relatives mentioned in the text this does not mean that all other unions within family are permissible bahá’u’lláh states that it devolves upon the house of justice to legislate “concerning the legitimacy or otherwise of marrying one’s relatives” ‘abdu’l‑bahá has written that the more distant the blood relationship between the couple the better since such marriages provide the basis for the physical well being of humanity and are conducive to fellowship among mankind the subject of boys¶ the word translated here as“boys”has in this context in the arabic original the implication of pederasty shoghi effendi has interpreted this reference as prohibition on all homosexual relations the bahá’í teachings on sexual morality center on marriage and the family as the bedrock of the whole structure of human society and are designed to protect and strengthen that divine institution bahá’í law thus restricts permissible sexual intercourse to that between man and the woman to whom he is married in letter written on behalf of shoghi effendi it is stated no matter how devoted and fine the love may be between people of the same sex to let it find expression in sexual acts is wrong to say that it is ideal is no excuse immorality of every sort is really forbidden by bahá’u’lláh and homosexual relationships he looks upon as such besides being against nature to be afflicted this way is great burden to conscientious soul but through the advice and help of doctors through strong and determined effort and through prayer soul can overcome this handicap bahá’u’lláh makes provision for the universal house of justice to determine according to the degree of the offense penalties for adultery and sodomy to none is it permitted to mutter sacred verses before the public gaze as he walketh in the street or marketplace¶ this is an allusion to the practice of certain clerics and religious leaders of earlier dispensations who out of hypocrisy and affectation and in order to win the praise of their followers would ostentatiously mutter prayers in public places as demonstration of their piety bahá’u’lláh forbids such behavior and stresses the importance of humility and genuine devotion to god unto everyone hath been enjoined the writing of will according to the teachings of bahá’u’lláh the individual has duty to write will and testament and is free to dispose of his estate in whatever manner he chooses see note bahá’u’lláh affirms that in drawing up his will“a person hath full jurisdiction over his property ”since god has permitted the individual“to deal with that which he hath bestowed upon him in whatever manner he may desire” provisions are set out in the kitáb aqdas for the distribution of inheritance in the case of intestacy see notes the most great name¶ as explained in note the greatest name of god can take various forms all based on the word “bahá the bahá’ís in the east have implemented this injunction of the aqdas by heading their wills with such phrases as “o thou glory of the all glorious “in the name of god the all glorious” or “he is the all glorious” and the like all feasts have attained their consummation in the two most great festivals and in the two other festivals that fall on the twin days¶ this passage establishes four great festivals of the bahá’í year the two designated by bahá’u’lláh as“the two most great festivals”are first the festival of riḍván which commemorates bahá’u’lláh’s declaration of his prophetic mission in the garden of riḍván in baghdád during twelve days in april may and is referred to by him as“the king of festivals”and second the báb’s declaration which occurred in may inshíráz the first ninth and twelfth days of the festival of riḍván are holy days as is the day of the declaration of the báb the“two other festivals”are the anniversaries of the births of bahá’u’lláh and the báb in the muslim lunar calendar these fall on consecutive days the birth of bahá’u’lláh on the second day of the month of muḥarram november and the birth of the báb on the first day of the same month october respectively they are thus referred to as the “twin birthdays” and bahá’u’lláh states that these two days are accounted as one in the sight of god he states that should they fall within the month of fasting the command to fast shall not apply on those days given that the bahá’í calendar see notes and is solar calendar it remains for the universal house of justice to determine whether the twin holy birthdays are to be celebrated on solar or lunar basis the first day of the month of bahá¶ in the bahá’í calendar the first month of the year and the first day of each month are given the name “bahá the day of bahá of the month of bahá is thus the bahá’í new year naw rúz which was ordained by the báb as festival and is here confirmed by bahá’u’lláh see notes and in addition to the seven holy days ordained in these passages of the kitáb aqdas the anniversary of the martyrdom of the báb was also commemorated as holy day in the lifetime of bahá’u’lláh and as corollary to this ‘abdu’l‑bahá added the observance of the ascension of bahá’u’lláh making nine holy days in all two other anniversaries which are observed but on which work is not suspended are the day of the covenant and the anniversary of the passing of ‘abdu’l‑bahá see the section on the bahá’í calendar inthe bahá’í world volume xviii the most great festival is indeed the king of festivals¶ reference to the riḍván festival see notes and god had formerly laid upon each one of the believers the duty of offering before our throne priceless gifts from among his possessions now we have absolved them of this obligation this passage abrogates provision of the bayán which decreed that all objects unparalleled of their kind should upon the appearance of him whom god will make manifest be rendered unto him the báb explained that since the manifestation of god is beyond compare whatever is peerless in its kind should rightfully be reserved for him unless he decrees otherwise the hour of dawn¶ with reference to attending dawn prayers in the mashriqu’l adhkár the bahá’í house of worship bahá’u’lláh has explained that although the actual time specified in the book of god is“the hour of dawn ”it is acceptable at any time from“the earliest dawn of day between dawn and sunrise or even up to two hours after sunrise” these tablets are embellished with the seal of him who causeth the dawn to appear who lifteth up his voice between the heavens and the earth bahá’u’lláh repeatedly affirms the absolute integrity of his writings as the word of god some of his tablets also bear the mark of one of his seals the bahá’í world volume contains photograph of number of bahá’u’lláh’s seals it is inadmissible that man who hath been endowed with reason should consume that which stealeth it away there are many references in the bahá’í writings which prohibit the use of wine and other intoxicating drinks and which describe the deleterious effect of such intoxicants on the individual in one of his tablets bahá’u’lláh states beware lest ye exchange the wine of god for your own wine for it will stupefy your minds and turn your faces away from the countenance of god the all glorious the peerless the inaccessible approach it not for it hath been forbidden unto you by the behest of god the exalted the almighty ‘abdu’l‑bahá explains that the aqdas prohibits“both light and strong drinks ”and he states that the reason for prohibiting the use of alcoholic drinks is because“alcohol leadeth the mind astray and causeth the weakening of the body shoghi effendi in letters written on his behalf states that this prohibition includes not only the consumption of wine but of “everything that deranges the mind and he clarifies that the use of alcohol is permitted only when it constitutes part of medical treatment which is implemented “under the advice of competent and conscientious physician who may have to prescribe it for the cure of some special ailment turn your faces toward him whom god hath purposed who hath branched from this ancient root¶ bahá’u’lláh here alludes to ‘abdu’l‑bahá as his successor and calls upon the believers to turn towards him in the book of the covenant his will and testament bahá’u’lláh discloses the intention of this verse he states “the object of this sacred verse is none other except the most mighty branch ”the“most mighty branch”is one of the titles conferred by bahá’u’lláh on ‘abdu’l‑bahá see also notes and in the bayán it had been forbidden you to ask us questions the báb forbade his followers to ask questions of him whom god will make manifest bahá’u’lláh unless their questions were submitted in writing and pertained to subjects worthy of his lofty station seeselections from the writings of the báb bahá’u’lláh removes this prohibition of the báb he invites the believers to ask such questions as they“need to ask ”and he cautions them to refrain from posing“idle questions”of the kind which preoccupied“the men of former times the number of months in year appointed in the book of god is nineteen the bahá’í year in accordance with the badí‘ calendar consists of nineteen months of nineteen days each with the addition of certain intercalary days four in an ordinary year and five in leap year between the eighteenth and nineteenth months in order to adjust the calendar to the solar year the báb named the months after certain attributes of god the bahá’í new year naw rúz is astronomically fixed coinciding with the march equinox see note for further details including the names of the days of the week and the months see the section on the bahá’í calendar inthe bahá’í world volume xviii the first hath been adorned with this name which overshadoweth the whole of creation¶ in the persian bayán the báb bestowed the name “bahá” on the first month of the year see note the lord hath decreed that the dead should be interred in coffins¶ in the bayán the báb prescribed that the deceased should be interred in coffin made of crystal or polished stone shoghi effendi in letter written on his behalf explained that the significance of this provision was to show respect for the human body which “was once exalted by the immortal soul of man in brief the bahá’í law for the burial of the dead states that it is forbidden to carry the body for more than one hour’s journey from the place of death that the body should be wrapped in shroud of silk or cotton and on its finger should be placed ring bearing the inscription“i came forth from god and return unto him detached from all save him holding fast to his name the merciful the compassionate” and that the coffin should be of crystal stone or hard fine wood specific prayer for the dead see note is ordained to be said before interment as affirmed by ‘abdu’l‑bahá and the guardian this law precludes cremation of the dead the formal prayer and the ring are meant to be used for those who have attained the age of maturity years of age with regard to the material from which the coffin is to be made the spirit of the law is that coffins should be of as durable material as possible hence the universal house of justice has explained that in addition to the materials specified in the aqdas there is no objection to using the hardest wood available or concrete for the casket for the present the bahá’ís are left free to make their own choices in this matter the point of the bayán¶ the“point of the bayán”is one of the titles by which the báb referred to himself the deceased should be enfolded in five sheets of silk or cotton¶ in the bayán the báb specified that the body of the deceased should be wrapped in five sheets of silk or cotton bahá’u’lláh confirmed this provision and added the stipulation that for“those whose means are limited single sheet of either fabric will suffice when asked whether the“five sheets”mentioned in the law referred to “five full length shrouds” or “five cloths which were hitherto customarily used bahá’u’lláh responded that the intention is the“use of five cloths” concerning the way in which the body should be wrapped there is nothing in the bahá’í writings to define how the wrapping of the body is to be done either when“five cloths”are used or only“a single sheet ”at present the bahá’ís are free to use their judgment in the matter it is forbidden you to transport the body of the deceased greater distance than one hour’s journey from the city¶ the intention of this command is to limit the duration of the journey to one hour’s time irrespective of the means of transport that are chosen to carry the body to the burial site bahá’u’lláh affirms that the sooner the burial takes place “the more fitting and acceptable will it be” the place of death may be taken to encompass the city or town in which the person passes away and therefore the one hour’s journey may be calculated from the city limits to the place of burial the spirit of bahá’u’lláh’s law is for the deceased to be buried near where he or she dies god hath removed the restrictions on travel that had been imposed in the bayán the báb decreed certain restrictions on travel which were to remain in force until the advent of the promised one of the bayán at which time the believers were instructed to set out even if on foot to meet him since the attainment of his presence was the fruit and purpose of their very existence raise up and exalt the two houses in the twin hallowed spots and the other sites wherein the throne of your lord hath been established bahá’u’lláh identifies the“two houses”as his house in baghdád designated by him as the“most great house ”and the house of the báb inshíráz both of which have been ordained by him as sites of pilgrimage see and note shoghi effendi explained that“the other sites wherein the throne of your lord hath been established”refers to those places where the person of the manifestation of god has resided bahá’u’lláh states that“the people of the areas where these are situated may choose to preserve either each house”wherein he resided “or one of them” bahá’í institutions have identified documented and where possible acquired and restored number of the historical sites associated with the twin manifestations take heed lest ye be prevented by aught that hath been recorded in the book from hearkening unto this the living book¶ the“book”is the record of the revealed word of the manifestations of god the“living book”is reference to the person of the manifestation these words contain an allusion to statement of the báb in the persian bayán about the“living book ”which he identifies as him whom god will make manifest in one of his tablets bahá’u’lláh himself states “the book of god hath been sent down in the form of this youth in this verse of the aqdas and again in paragraph of the aqdas bahá’u’lláh refers to himself as the“living book ”he cautions the“followers of every other faith”against seeking“reasons in their holy books”for refuting the utterances of the“living book ”he admonishes the people not to allow what has been recorded in the“book”to prevent them from recognizing his station and from holding fast to what is in this new revelation tribute to this revelation from the pen of him who was my herald¶ the“tribute”that bahá’u’lláh quotes in this passage is from the arabic bayán “the qiblih is indeed he whom god will make manifest whenever he moveth it moveth until he shall come to rest ”¶ for discussion of this verse see notes and it is unlawful to enter into marriage save with believer in the bayán should only one party to marriage embrace this cause his or her possessions will become unlawful to the other¶ the passage of the bayán which bahá’u’lláh here quotes draws the attention of the believers to the imminence of the coming of “him whom god will make manifest its prohibition of marriage with non bábí and its provision that the property of husband or wife who embraced the faith could not lawfully pass to the non bábí spouse were explicitly held in abeyance by the báb and were subsequently annulled by bahá’u’lláh before they could come into effect bahá’u’lláh in quoting this law points to the fact that in revealing it the báb had clearly anticipated the possibility that the cause of bahá’u’lláh would rise to prominence before that of the báb himself ingod passes byshoghi effendi points out that the bayán “should be regarded primarily as eulogy of the promised one rather than code of laws and ordinances designed to be permanent guide to future generations “designedly severe in the rules and regulations it imposed he continues “revolutionizing in the principles it instilled calculated to awaken from their age long torpor the clergy and the people and to administer sudden and fatal blow to obsolete and corrupt institutions it proclaimed through its drastic provisions the advent of the anticipated day the day when ‘the summoner shall summon to stern business when he will ‘demolish whatever hath been before him even as the apostle of god demolished the ways of those that preceded him’” see also note the point of the bayán¶ one of the titles of the báb verily there is none other god besides me¶ the bahá’í writings contain many passages that elucidate the nature of the manifestation and his relationship to god bahá’u’lláh underlines the unique and transcendent nature of the godhead he explains that“since there can be no tie of direct intercourse to bind the one true god with his creation”god ordains that“in every age and dispensation pure and stainless soul be made manifest in the kingdoms of earth and heaven ”this“mysterious and ethereal being ”the manifestation of god has human nature which pertains to“the world of matter”and spiritual nature“born of the substance of god himself ”he is also endowed with a“double station” the first station which is related to his innermost reality representeth him as one whose voice is the voice of god himself the second station is the human station exemplified by the following verses “i am but man like you “say praise be to my lord am more than man an apostle bahá’u’lláh also affirms that in the spiritual realm there is an“essential unity”between all the manifestations of god they all reveal the“beauty of god ”manifest his names and attributes and give utterance to his revelation in this regard he states were any of the all embracing manifestations of god to declare “i am god he verily speaketh the truth and no doubt attacheth thereto for it hath been repeatedly demonstrated that through their revelation their attributes and names the revelation of god his name and his attributes are made manifest in the world while the manifestations reveal the names and attributes of god and are the means by which humanity has access to the knowledge of god and his revelation shoghi effendi states that the manifestations should “never be identified with that invisible reality the essence of divinity itself in relation to bahá’u’lláh the guardian wrote that the “human temple that has been the vehicle of so overpowering revelation” is not to be identified with the “reality” of god concerning the uniqueness of bahá’u’lláh’s station and the greatness of his revelation shoghi effendi affirms that the prophetic statements concerning the “day of god found in the sacred scriptures of past dispensations are fulfilled by the advent of bahá’u’lláh to israel he was neither more nor less than the incarnation of the “everlasting father the “lord of hosts” come down “with ten thousands of saints” to christendom christ returned “in the glory of the father” toshí‘ah islám the return of the imám ḥusayn to sunní islám the descent of the “spirit of god” jesus christ to the zoroastrians the promisedsháh bahrám to the hindus the reincarnation of krishna to the buddhists the fifth buddha bahá’u’lláh describes the station of “divinity” which he shares with all the manifestations of god as …the station in which one dieth to himself and liveth in god divinity whenever mention it indicateth my complete and absolute self effacement this is the station in which have no control over mine own weal or woe nor over my life nor over my resurrection and regarding his own relationship to god he testifies when contemplate my god the relationship that bindeth me to thee am moved to proclaim to all created things “verily am god and when consider my own self lo find it coarser than clay payment of zakát¶ zakát is referred to in the qur’án as regular charity binding upon muslims in due course the concept evolved into form of alms tax which imposed the obligation to give fixed portion of certain categories of income beyond specified limits for the relief of the poor for various charitable purposes and to aid the faith of god the limit of exemption varied for different commodities as did the percentage payable on the portion assessable bahá’u’lláh states that the bahá’í law of zakát follows“what hath been revealed in the qur’án” since such issues as the limits for exemption the categories of income concerned the frequency of payments and the scale of rates for the various categories of zakát are not mentioned in the qur’án these matters will have to be set forth in the future by the universal house of justice shoghi effendi has indicated that pending such legislation the believers should according to their means and possibilities make regular contributions to the bahá’í fund it is unlawful to beg and it is forbidden to give to him who beggeth in tablet ‘abdu’l‑bahá expounds the meaning of this verse he states that“mendicancy is forbidden and that giving charity to people who take up begging as their profession is also prohibited ”he further points out in that same tablet “the object is to uproot mendicancy altogether however if person is incapable of earning living is stricken by dire poverty or becometh helpless then it is incumbent on the wealthy or the deputies to provide him with monthly allowance for his subsistence by ‘deputies’ is meant the representatives of the people that is to say the members of the house of justice the prohibition against giving charity to people who beg does not preclude individuals and spiritual assemblies from extending financial assistance to the poor and needy or from providing them with opportunities to acquire such skills as would enable them to earn livelihood see note fine had formerly been prescribed for anyone who was the cause of sadness to another¶ bahá’u’lláh abrogates the law of the persian bayán concerning the payment of fine in reparation for causing sadness to one’s neighbor the sacred lote tree¶ the“sacred lote tree”is reference to the sadratu’l muntahá the“tree beyond which there is no passing” see note it is used here symbolically to designate bahá’u’lláh recite ye the verses of god every morn and eventide bahá’u’lláh states that the essential“requisite”for reciting“the verses of god”is the“eagerness and love”of the believers to“read the word of god” with regard to the definition of“verses of god ”bahá’u’lláh states that it refers to“all that hath been sent down from the heaven of divine utterance ”shoghi effendi in letter written to one of the believers in the east has clarified that the term“verses of god”does not include the writings of ‘abdu’l‑bahá he has likewise indicated that this term does not apply to his own writings ye have been enjoined to renew the furnishings of your homes after the passing of each nineteen years¶ bahá’u’lláh confirms the injunction in the arabic bayán regarding the renewal every nineteen years of the furnishings of one’s home provided one is able to do so ‘abdu’l‑bahá relates this ordinance to the promotion of refinement and cleanliness he explains that the purpose of the law is that one should change those furnishings that become old lose their luster and provoke repugnance it does not apply to such things as rare or treasured articles antiques or jewelry wash your feet¶ the believers are exhorted in the kitáb aqdas to bathe regularly to wear clean clothes and generally to be the essence of cleanliness and refinement the synopsis and codification section iv –vii summarizes the relevant provisions in relation to the washing of the feet bahá’u’lláh states that it is preferable to use warm water however washing in cold water is also permissible ye have been prohibited from making use of pulpits whoso wisheth to recite unto you the verses of his lord let him sit on chair placed upon dais¶ these provisions have their antecedent in the persian bayán the báb forbade the use of pulpits for the delivery of sermons and the reading of the text he specified instead that to enable all to hear the word of god clearly chair for the speaker should be placed upon platform in comments on this law ‘abdu’l‑bahá and shoghi effendi have made it clear that in the mashriqu’l adhkár where sermons are prohibited and only the words of holy scripture may be read the reader may stand or sit and if necessary to be better heard may use low movable platform but that no pulpit is permitted in the case of meetings in places other than the mashriqu’l adhkár it is also permissible for the reader or speaker to sit or stand and to use platform in one of his tablets when reiterating the prohibition of the use of pulpits in any location ‘abdu’l‑bahá has stressed that when bahá’ís deliver their speeches in gatherings they are to do so in an attitude of utmost humility and self abnegation gambling¶ the activities that are included in this prohibition have not been outlined in the writings of bahá’u’lláh as both ‘abdu’l‑bahá and shoghi effendi have indicated it is left to the universal house of justice to specify the details of this prohibition in response to questions about whether lotteries betting on such things as horse races and football games bingo and the like are included under the prohibition of gambling the universal house of justice has indicated that this is matter that will be considered in detail in the future in the meantime the assemblies and individuals are counseled not to make an issue of these matters and to leave it to the conscience of the individual believers the house of justice has ruled that it is not appropriate for funds for the faith to be raised through lotteries raffles and games of chance the use of opium any substance that induceth sluggishness and torpor¶ this prohibition of the use of opium is reiterated by bahá’u’lláh in the final paragraph of the kitáb aqdas in this connection shoghi effendi stated that one of the requirements for “a chaste and holy life” is “total abstinence from opium and from similar habit forming drugs heroin hashish and other derivatives of cannabis such as marijuana as well as hallucinogenic agents such as lsd peyote and similar substances are regarded as falling under this prohibition ‘abdu’l‑bahá has written as to opium it is foul and accursed god protect us from the punishment he inflicteth on the user according to the explicit text of the most holy book it is forbidden and its use is utterly condemned reason showeth that smoking opium is kind of insanity and experience attesteth that the user is completely cut off from the human kingdom may god protect all against the perpetration of an act so hideous as this an act which layeth in ruins the very foundation of what it is to be human and which causeth the user to be dispossessed for ever and ever for opium fasteneth on the soul so that the user’s conscience dieth his mind is blotted away his perceptions are eroded it turneth the living into the dead it quencheth the natural heat no greater harm can be conceived than that which opium inflicteth fortunate are they who never even speak the name of it then think how wretched is the user ye lovers of god in this the cycle of almighty god violence and force constraint and oppression are one and all condemned it is however mandatory that the use of opium be prevented by any means whatsoever that perchance the human race may be delivered from this most powerful of plagues and otherwise woe and misery to whoso falleth short of his duty to his lord in one of his tablets ‘abdu’l‑bahá has stated concerning opium “the user the buyer and the seller are all deprived of the bounty and grace of god in yet another tablet ‘abdu’l‑bahá has written regarding hashish you have pointed out that some persians have become habituated to its use gracious god this is the worst of all intoxicants and its prohibition is explicitly revealed its use causeth the disintegration of thought and the complete torpor of the soul how could anyone seek the fruit of the infernal tree and by partaking of it be led to exemplify the qualities of monster how could one use this forbidden drug and thus deprive himself of the blessings of the all merciful alcohol consumeth the mind and causeth man to commit acts of absurdity but this opium this foul fruit of the infernal tree and this wicked hashish extinguish the mind freeze the spirit petrify the soul waste the body and leave man frustrated and lost it should be noted that the above prohibition against taking certain classes of drugs does not forbid their use when prescribed by qualified physicians as part of medical treatment the “mystery of the great reversal in the sign of the sovereign”¶ shaykhaḥmad aḥsá’í who was the founder of theshaykhí school and the first of the “twin luminaries that heralded the advent of the faith of the báb prophesied that at the appearance of the promised one all things would be reversed the last would be first the first last bahá’u’lláh in one of his tablets refers to the“symbol and allusion”of the“mystery of the great reversal in the sign of the sovereign ”he states “through this reversal he hath caused the exalted to be abased and the abased to be exalted ”and he recalls that“in the days of jesus it was those who were distinguished for their learning the men of letters and religion who denied him whilst humble fisherman made haste to gain admittance into the kingdom” see also note for additional information aboutshaykhaḥmad aḥsá’í seethe dawn breakers chapters and the “six” raised up by virtue of this “upright alif”¶ in his writings shaykhaḥmad aḥsá’í placed great emphasis on the arabic letter “váv inthe dawn breakers nabíl states that this letter “symbolized for the báb the advent of new cycle of divine revelation and has since been alluded to by bahá’u’lláh in the kitáb aqdas in such passages as‘the mystery of the great reversal’and‘the sign of the sovereign ’” the name for the letter “váv” consists of three letters váv alif váv according to the abjad reckoning the numerical value of each of these letters is and respectively shoghi effendi in letter written on his behalf to one of the believers in the east provides an interpretation of this verse of the aqdas he states that the“upright alif”refers to the advent of the báb the first letter with its value of six which comes before the alif is symbol of earlier dispensations and manifestations which predate the báb while the third letter which also has numerical value of six stands for bahá’u’lláh’s supreme revelation which was made manifest after the alif it hath been forbidden you to carry arms unless essential¶ bahá’u’lláh confirms an injunction contained in the bayán which makes it unlawful to carry arms unless it is necessary to do so with regard to circumstances under which the bearing of arms might be“essential”for an individual ‘abdu’l‑bahá gives permission to believer for self protection in dangerous environment shoghi effendi in letter written on his behalf has also indicated that in an emergency when there is no legal force at hand to appeal to bahá’í is justified in defending his life there are number of other situations in which weapons are needed and can be legitimately used for instance in countries where people hunt for their food and clothing and in such sports as archery marksmanship and fencing on the societal level the principle of collective security enunciated by bahá’u’lláh seegleanings from the writings of bahá’u’lláh cxvii and elaborated by shoghi effendi see the guardian’s letters inthe world order of bahá’u’lláh does not presuppose the abolition of the use of force but prescribes “a system in which force is made the servant of justice and which provides for the existence of an international peacekeeping force that “will safeguard the organic unity of the whole commonwealth in the tablet of bishárát bahá’u’lláh expresses the hope that“weapons of war throughout the world may be converted into instruments of reconstruction and that strife and conflict may be removed from the midst of men in that same tablet bahá’u’lláh stresses the importance of fellowship with the followers of all religions he also states that“the law of holy war hath been blotted out from the book and permitted you to attire yourselves in silk¶ according to islamic practice the wearing of silk by men was generally forbidden except in times of holy war this prohibition which was not based on the verses of the qur’án was abrogated by the báb the lord hath relieved you of the restrictions that formerly applied to clothing and to the trim of the beard many rules about dress had their origins in the laws and traditional practices of the world’s religions for example theshí‘ih clergy adopted for themselves distinctive headdress and robes and at one time forbade the people to adopt european attire muslim practice in its desire to emulate the custom of the prophet also introduced number of restrictions with regard to the trim of the moustache and the length of the beard bahá’u’lláh removed such limitations on one’s apparel and beard he leaves such matters to the“discretion”of the individual and at the same time calls upon the believers not to transgress the bounds of propriety and to exercise moderation in all that pertains to dress land of káf and rá káf and rá are the first two consonants of kirmán the name of city and province of iran we perceive that which secretly and stealthily diffuseth from thee this passage is reference to the intrigues of group of azalís followers of mírzá yaḥyá see note associated with the city of kirmán they include mullá ja‘far his sonshaykhaḥmad rúḥí and mírzá áqákhán kirmání both sons in law of mírzá yaḥyá as well as mírzá aḥmad kirmání they not only sought to undermine the faith but involved themselves in political intrigues which culminated in the assassination of náṣiri’d dínsháh call ye to mind theshaykhwhose name was muḥammad ḥasan¶ shaykhmuḥammad ḥasan one of the leading exponents ofshí‘ih islám rejected the báb the author of voluminous writings onshí‘ih jurisprudence he is reported to have died around nabíl inthe dawn breakers describes the encounter that took place in najaf between mullá ‘alíy basṭámí one of the letters of the living andshaykhmuḥammad ḥasan during the meeting mullá ‘alí announced the manifestation of the báb and extolled the potency of his revelation at the instigation of theshaykh mullá ‘alí was forthwith pronounced heretic and expelled from the assembly he was put on trial transported to istanbul and condemned to hard labor sifter of wheat and barley¶ this is an allusion to mullá muḥammad ja‘far gandum pák kun the first person in iṣfahán to accept the faith of the báb he is mentioned in the persian bayán and praised as one who“donned the robe of discipleship ”inthe dawn breakers nabíl describes the unreserved acceptance of the message by the “sifter of wheat” and his zealous advocacy of the new revelation he joined the company of the defenders of the fort ofshaykhṭabarsí and perished during that siege take heed lest the word “prophet” withhold you from this most great announcement¶ bahá’u’lláh cautions people“of insight”not to allow their interpretations of the holy scriptures to prevent them from recognizing the manifestation of god followers of each religion have tended to allow their devotion to its founder to cause them to perceive his revelation as the final word of god and to deny the possibility of the appearance of any subsequent prophet this has been the case of judaism christianity and islám bahá’u’lláh denies the validity of this concept of finality both in relation to past dispensations and to his own with regard to muslims he wrote in the kitáb íqán that the“people of the qur’án have allowed the words ‘seal of the prophets’ to veil their eyes ”“to obscure their understanding and deprive them of the grace of all his manifold bounties ”he affirms that“this theme hath been sore test unto all mankind ”and laments the fate of“those who clinging unto these words have disbelieved in him who is their true revealer ”the báb refers to this same theme when he warns “let not names shut you out as by veil from him who is their lord even the name of prophet for such name is but creation of his utterance any reference to “vicegerency” debar you from the sovereignty of him who is the vicegerent of god¶ the word here translated“vicegerency”is in the original arabic “viláyat which has range of meanings including “vicegerency “guardianship “protectorship” and “successorship it is used in relation to god himself to his manifestation or to those who are the appointed successors of manifestation in this verse of the aqdas bahá’u’lláh warns against allowing such concepts to blind one to the“sovereignty”of the new divine manifestation the true“vicegerent of god call ye to mind karím¶ ḥájí mírzá muḥammad karímkhán kirmání –circa was the self appointed leader of theshaykhí community after the death of siyyid káẓim who was the appointed successor toshaykhaḥmad aḥsá’í see notes and he dedicated himself to the promotion of the teachings ofshaykhaḥmad the opinions he expressed became the subject of controversy among his supporters and opponents alike regarded as one of the leading savants and prolific authors of his age he composed numerous books and epistles in the various fields of learning that were cultivated in those times he actively opposed both the báb and bahá’u’lláh and used his treatises to attack the báb and his teachings in the kitáb íqán bahá’u’lláh condemns the tone and content of his writings and singles out for criticism one of his works which contains negative allusions to the báb shoghi effendi describes him as “inordinately ambitious and hypocritical” and describes how he “at the special request of thesháh had in treatise viciously attacked the new faith and its doctrines ye the learned ones in bahá¶ bahá’u’lláh eulogizes the learned among his followers in the book of his covenant he wrote “blessed are the rulers and learned among the people of bahá ”referring to this statement shoghi effendi has written in this holy cycle the“learned”are on the one hand the hands of the cause of god and on the other the teachers and diffusers of his teachings who do not rank as hands but who have attained an eminent position in the teaching work as to the“rulers”they refer to the members of the local national and international houses of justice the duties of each of these souls will be determined in the future the hands of the cause of god were individuals appointed by bahá’u’lláh and charged with various duties especially those of protecting and propagating his faith inmemorials of the faithful‘abdu’l‑bahá referred to other outstanding believers as hands of the cause and in his will and testament he included provision calling upon the guardian of the faith to appoint hands of the cause at his discretion shoghi effendi first raised posthumously number of the believers to the rank of hands of the cause and during the latter years of his life appointed total of believers from all continents to this position in the period between the passing of shoghi effendi in and the election of the universal house of justice in the hands of the cause directed the affairs of the faith in their capacity as chief stewards of bahá’u’lláh’s embryonic world commonwealth see note in november the universal house of justice determined that it could not legislate to make it possible to appoint hands of the cause instead by decision of the house of justice in the functions of the hands of the cause in relation to protecting and propagating the faith were extended into the future by the creation of the continental boards of counselors and in through the establishment of the international teaching center which has its seat in the holy land the universal house of justice appoints the counselor members of the international teaching center and the continental counselors members of auxiliary boards are appointed by the continental counselors all these individuals fall within the definition of the“learned”given by shoghi effendi in the statement quoted above refer ye whatsoever ye understand not in the book to him who hath branched from this mighty stock¶ bahá’u’lláh invests ‘abdu’l‑bahá with the right of interpreting his holy writ see also note the school of transcendent oneness¶ in this verse and the ones which immediately follow it bahá’u’lláh confronts one of the reasons some of the bábís rejected his claim to be the promised one of the bayán their rejection was based on tablet addressed by the báb to “him who will be made manifest” on the reverse side of which the báb had written “may the glances of him whom god shall make manifest illumine this letter at the primary school ”this tablet is published inselections from the writings of the báb these bábís maintained that since bahá’u’lláh was two years older than the báb it was not possible for him to receive this tablet“at the primary school bahá’u’lláh here explains that the reference is to events transpiring in the spiritual worlds beyond this plane of existence we accepted the verses of god which he presented unto us¶ in his tablet addressed to “him who will be made manifest the báb characterizes the bayán as an offering from him to bahá’u’lláh seeselections from the writings of the báb people of the bayán reference to the followers of the báb the letters and were joined and knit together¶ shoghi effendi in letters written on his behalf has explained the significance of the“letters and ”they constitute the word “be which he states “means the creative power of god who through his command causes all things to come into being” and “the power of the manifestation of god his great spiritual creative force the imperative “be” in the original arabic is the word “kun consisting of the two letters “káf” and “nún they have been translated by shoghi effendi in the above manner this word has been used in the qur’án as god’s bidding calling creation into being this new world order¶ in the persian bayán the báb stated “well is it with him who fixeth his gaze upon the order of bahá’u’lláh and rendereth thanks unto his lord for he will assuredly be made manifest god hath indeed irrevocably ordained it in the bayán ”shoghi effendi identifies this“order”with the system bahá’u’lláh envisages in the aqdas in which he testifies to its revolutionizing effect on the life of humanity and reveals the laws and principles which govern its operation the features of the“new world order”are delineated in the writings of bahá’u’lláh and ‘abdu’l‑bahá and in the letters of shoghi effendi and the universal house of justice the institutions of the present day bahá’í administrative order which constitute the “structural basis” of bahá’u’lláh’s world order will mature and evolve into the bahá’í world commonwealth in this regard shoghi effendi affirms that the administrative order “will as its component parts its organic institutions begin to function with efficiency and vigor assert its claim and demonstrate its capacity to be regarded not only as the nucleus but the very pattern of the new world order destined to embrace in the fullness of time the whole of mankind for additional information on the evolution of this new world order see for example the letters of shoghi effendi published inthe world order of bahá’u’lláh source of perversion this is reference to mírzá yaḥyá known as ṣubḥ azal morning of eternity younger half brother of bahá’u’lláh who arose against him and opposed his cause mírzá yaḥyá was nominated by the báb to serve as figurehead for the bábí community pending the imminent manifestation of the promised one at the instigation of siyyid muḥammad iṣfahání see note mírzá yaḥyá betrayed the trust of the báb claimed to be his successor and intrigued against bahá’u’lláh even attempting to have him murdered when bahá’u’lláh formally declared his mission to him in adrianople mírzá yaḥyá responded by going to the length of putting forward his own claim to be the recipient of an independent revelation his pretensions were eventually rejected by all but few who became known as azalís see note he is described by shoghi effendi as the “arch breaker of the covenant of the báb” seegod passes by chapter remember how we nurtured thee by day and by night for service to the cause¶ ingod passes by shoghi effendi refers to the fact that bahá’u’lláh who was thirteen years older than mírzá yaḥyá had counseled him and watched over his early youth and manhood god hath laid hold on him who led thee astray reference to siyyid muḥammad iṣfahání who is described by shoghi effendi as the “antichrist of the bahá’í revelation he was man of corrupt character and great personal ambition who induced mírzá yaḥyá to oppose bahá’u’lláh and to claim prophethood for himself see note although he was an adherent of mírzá yaḥyá siyyid muḥammad was exiled with bahá’u’lláh to ‘akká he continued to agitate and plot against bahá’u’lláh in describing the circumstances of his death shoghi effendi has written ingod passes by fresh danger now clearly threatened the life of bahá’u’lláh though he himself had stringently forbidden his followers on several occasions both verbally and in writing any retaliatory acts against their tormentors and had even sent back to beirut an irresponsible arab convert who had meditated avenging the wrongs suffered by his beloved leader seven of the companions clandestinely sought out and slew three of their persecutors among whom were siyyid muḥammad and áqá ján the consternation that seized an already oppressed community was indescribable bahá’u’lláh’s indignation knew no bounds “were we ”he thus voices his emotions in tablet revealed shortly after this act had been committed “to make mention of what befell us the heavens would be rent asunder and the mountains would crumble ”“my captivity ”he wrote on another occasion “cannot harm me that which can harm me is the conduct of those who love me who claim to be related to me and yet perpetrate what causeth my heart and my pen to groan select ye single language adopt ye common script bahá’u’lláh enjoins the adoption of universal language and script his writings envisage two stages in this process the first stage is to consist of the selection of an existing language or an invented one which would then be taught in all the schools of the world as an auxiliary to the mother tongues the governments of the world through their parliaments are called upon to effect this momentous enactment the second stage in the distant future would be the eventual adoption of one single language and common script for all on earth we have appointed two signs for the coming of age of the human race¶ the first sign of the coming of age of humanity referred to in the writings of bahá’u’lláh is the emergence of science which is described as that“divine philosophy”which will include the discovery of radical approach to the transmutation of elements this is an indication of the splendors of the future stupendous expansion of knowledge concerning the“second”sign which bahá’u’lláh indicates to have been revealed in the kitáb aqdas shoghi effendi states that bahá’u’lláh “…in his most holy book has enjoined the selection of single language and the adoption of common script for all on earth to use an injunction which when carried out would as he himself affirms in that book be one of the signs of the‘coming of age of the human race ’” further insight into this process of mankind’s coming of age and proceeding to maturity is provided by the following statement of bahá’u’lláh one of the signs of the maturity of the world is that no one will accept to bear the weight of kingship kingship will remain with none willing to bear alone its weight that day will be the day whereon wisdom will be manifested among mankind the coming of age of the human race has been associated by shoghi effendi with the unification of the whole of mankind the establishment of world commonwealth and an unprecedented stimulus to “the intellectual the moral and spiritual life of the entire human race abbreviations of sources

fulfilled the day in which the word of god hath been made manifest and his evidence firmly established his voice is calling you unto that which shall profit you and enjoineth you to observe that which shall draw you nigh unto god the lord of revelation —bahá’u’lláh foreword this is one more attempt to introduce to the west in language however inadequate this book of unsurpassed preeminence among the writings of the author of the bahá’í revelation the hope is that it may assist others in their efforts to approach what must always be regarded as the unattainable goal—a befitting rendering of bahá’u’lláh’s matchless utterance —shoghi in the name of our lord the exalted the most high no man shall attain the shores of the ocean of true understanding except he be detached from all that is in heaven and on earth sanctify your souls ye peoples of the world that haply ye may attain that station which god hath destined for you and enter thus the tabernacle which according to the dispensations of providence hath been raised in the firmament of the bayán theessence of these words is this they that tread the path of faith they that thirst for the wine of certitude must cleanse themselves of all that is earthly—their ears from idle talk their minds from vain imaginings their hearts from worldly affections their eyes from that which perisheth they should put their trust in god and holding fast unto him follow in his way then will they be made worthy of the effulgent glories of the sun of divine knowledge and understanding and become the recipients of grace that is infinite and unseen inasmuch as man can never hope to attain unto the knowledge of the all glorious can never quaff from the stream of divine knowledge and wisdom can never enter the abode of immortality nor partake of the cup of divine nearness and favor unless and until he ceases to regard the words and deeds of mortal men as standard for the true understanding and recognition of god and his prophets consider the past how many both high and low have at all times yearningly awaited the advent of the manifestations of god in the sanctified persons of his chosen ones how often have they expected his coming how frequently have they prayed that the breeze of divine mercy might blow and the promised beauty step forth from behind the veil of concealment and be made manifest to all the world and whensoever the portals of grace did open and the clouds of divine bounty did rain upon mankind and the light of the unseen did shine above the horizon of celestial might they all denied him and turned away from his face—the face of god himself refer ye to verify this truth to that which hath been recorded in every sacred book ponder for moment and reflect upon that which hath been the cause of such denial on the part of those who have searched with such earnestness and longing their attack hath been more fierce than tongue or pen can describe not one single manifestation of holiness hath appeared but he was afflicted by the denials the repudiation and the vehement opposition of the people around him thus it hath been revealed “o the misery of men no messenger cometh unto them but they laugh him to scorn again he saith “each nation hath plotted darkly against their messenger to lay violent hold on him and disputed with vain words to invalidate the truth in like manner those words that have streamed forth from the source of power and descended from the heaven of glory are innumerable and beyond the ordinary comprehension of man to them that are possessed of true understanding and insight the súrah of húd surely sufficeth ponder while those holy words in your heart and with utter detachment strive to grasp their meaning examine the wondrous behavior of the prophets and recall the defamations and denials uttered by the children of negation and falsehood perchance you may cause the bird of the human heart to wing its flight away from the abodes of heedlessness and doubt unto the nest of faith and certainty and drink deep from the pure waters of ancient wisdom and partake of the fruit of the tree of divine knowledge such is the share of the pure in heart of the bread that hath descended from the realms of eternity and holiness should you acquaint yourself with the indignities heaped upon the prophets of god and apprehend the true causes of the objections voiced by their oppressors you will surely appreciate the significance of their position moreover the more closely you observe the denials of those who have opposed the manifestations of the divine attributes the firmer will be your faith in the cause of god accordingly brief mention will be made in this tablet of divers accounts relative to the prophets of god that they may demonstrate the truth that throughout all ages and centuries the manifestations of power and glory have been subjected to such heinous cruelties that no pen dare describe them perchance this may enable few to cease to be perturbed by the clamor and protestations of the divines and the foolish of this age and cause them to strengthen their confidence and certainty among the prophets was noah for nine hundred and fifty years he prayerfully exhorted his people and summoned them to the haven of security and peace none however heeded his call each day they inflicted on his blessed person such pain and suffering that no one believed he could survive how frequently they denied him how malevolently they hinted their suspicion against him thus it hath been revealed “and as often as company of his people passed by him they derided him to them he said ‘though ye scoff at us now we will scoff at you hereafter even as ye scoff at us in the end ye shall know ’” long afterward he several times promised victory to his companions and fixed the hour thereof but when the hour struck the divine promise was not fulfilled this caused few among the small number of his followers to turn away from him and to this testify the records of the best known books these you must certainly have perused if not undoubtedly you will finally as stated in books and traditions there remained with him only forty or seventy two of his followers at last from the depth of his being he cried aloud “lord leave not upon the land single dweller from among the unbelievers and now consider and reflect moment upon the waywardness of this people what could have been the reason for such denial and avoidance on their part what could have induced them to refuse to put off the garment of denial and to adorn themselves with the robe of acceptance moreover what could have caused the nonfulfillment of the divine promise which led the seekers to reject that which they had accepted meditate profoundly that the secret of things unseen may be revealed unto you that you may inhale the sweetness of spiritual and imperishable fragrance and that you may acknowledge the truth that from time immemorial even unto eternity the almighty hath tried and will continue to try his servants so that light may be distinguished from darkness truth from falsehood right from wrong guidance from error happiness from misery and roses from thorns even as he hath revealed “do men think when they say ‘we believe’ they shall be let alone and not be put to proof and after noah the light of the countenance of húd shone forth above the horizon of creation for well nigh seven hundred years according to the sayings of men he exhorted the people to turn their faces and draw nearer unto the riḍván of the divine presence what showers of afflictions rained upon him until at last his adjurations bore the fruit of increased rebelliousness and his assiduous endeavors resulted in the willful blindness of his people “and their unbelief shall only increase for the unbelievers their own perdition and after him there appeared from the riḍván of the eternal the invisible the holy person of ṣáliḥ who again summoned the people to the river of everlasting life for over hundred years he admonished them to hold fast unto the commandments of god and eschew that which is forbidden his admonitions however yielded no fruit and his pleading proved of no avail several times he retired and lived in seclusion all this although that eternal beauty was summoning the people to no other than the city of god even as it is revealed “and unto the tribe ofthamúd we sent their brother ṣáliḥ ‘o my people said he ‘worship god ye have none other god beside him …’ they made reply ‘o ṣáliḥ our hopes were fixed on thee until now forbiddest thou us to worship that which our fathers worshipped truly we misdoubt that whereunto thou callest us as suspicious ’” all this proved fruitless until at last there went up great cry and all fell into utter perdition later the beauty of the countenance of the friend of god appeared from behind the veil and another standard of divine guidance was hoisted he invited the people of the earth to the light of righteousness the more passionately he exhorted them the fiercer waxed the envy and waywardness of the people except those who wholly detached themselves from all save god and ascended on the wings of certainty to the station which god hath exalted beyond the comprehension of men it is well known what host of enemies besieged him until at last the fires of envy and rebellion were kindled against him and after the episode of the fire came to pass he the lamp of god amongst men was as recorded in all books and chronicles expelled from his city and when his day was ended there came the turn of moses armed with the rod of celestial dominion adorned with the white hand of divine knowledge and proceeding from the párán of the love of god and wielding the serpent of power and everlasting majesty he shone forth from the sinai of light upon the world he summoned all the peoples and kindreds of the earth to the kingdom of eternity and invited them to partake of the fruit of the tree of faithfulness surely you are aware of the fierce opposition of pharaoh and his people and of the stones of idle fancy which the hands of infidels cast upon that blessed tree so much so that pharaoh and his people finally arose and exerted their utmost endeavor to extinguish with the waters of falsehood and denial the fire of that sacred tree oblivious of the truth that no earthly water can quench the flame of divine wisdom nor mortal blasts extinguish the lamp of everlasting dominion nay rather such water cannot but intensify the burning of the flame and such blasts cannot but ensure the preservation of the lamp were ye to observe with the eye of discernment and walk in the way of god’s holy will and pleasure how well hath believer of the kindred of pharaoh whose story is recounted by the all glorious in his book revealed unto his beloved one observed “and man of the family of pharaoh who was believer and concealed his faith said ‘will ye slay man because he saith my lord is god when he hath already come to you with signs from your lord if he be liar on him will be his lie but if he be man of truth part of what he threateneth will fall upon you in truth god guideth not him who is transgressor liar ’” finally so great was their iniquity that this selfsame believer was put to shameful death “the curse of god be upon the people of tyranny and now ponder upon these things what could have caused such contention and conflict why is it that the advent of every true manifestation of god hath been accompanied by such strife and tumult by such tyranny and upheaval this notwithstanding the fact that all the prophets of god whenever made manifest unto the peoples of the world have invariably foretold the coming of yet another prophet after them and have established such signs as would herald the advent of the future dispensation to this the records of all sacred books bear witness why then is it that despite the expectation of men in their quest of the manifestations of holiness and in spite of the signs recorded in the sacred books such acts of violence of oppression and cruelty should have been perpetrated in every age and cycle against all the prophets and chosen ones of god even as he hath revealed “as oft as an apostle cometh unto you with that which your souls desire not ye swell with pride accusing some of being impostors and slaying others reflect what could have been the motive for such deeds what could have prompted such behavior towards the revealers of the beauty of the all glorious whatever in days gone by hath been the cause of the denial and opposition of those people hath now led to the perversity of the people of this age to maintain that the testimony of providence was incomplete that it hath therefore been the cause of the denial of the people is but open blasphemy how far from the grace of the all bountiful and from his loving providence and tender mercies it is to single out soul from amongst all men for the guidance of his creatures and on one hand to withhold from him the full measure of his divine testimony and on the other inflict severe retribution on his people for having turned away from his chosen one nay the manifold bounties of the lord of all beings have at all times through the manifestations of his divine essence encompassed the earth and all that dwell therein not for moment hath his grace been withheld nor have the showers of his loving kindness ceased to rain upon mankind consequently such behavior can be attributed to naught save the petty mindedness of such souls as tread the valley of arrogance and pride are lost in the wilds of remoteness walk in the ways of their idle fancy and follow the dictates of the leaders of their faith their chief concern is mere opposition their sole desire is to ignore the truth unto every discerning observer it is evident and manifest that had these people in the days of each of the manifestations of the sun of truth sanctified their eyes their ears and their hearts from whatever they had seen heard and felt they surely would not have been deprived of beholding the beauty of god nor strayed far from the habitations of glory but having weighed the testimony of god by the standard of their own knowledge gleaned from the teachings of the leaders of their faith and found it at variance with their limited understanding they arose to perpetrate such unseemly acts leaders of religion in every age have hindered their people from attaining the shores of eternal salvation inasmuch as they held the reins of authority in their mighty grasp some for the lust of leadership others through want of knowledge and understanding have been the cause of the deprivation of the people by their sanction and authority every prophet of god hath drunk from the chalice of sacrifice and winged his flight unto the heights of glory what unspeakable cruelties they that have occupied the seats of authority and learning have inflicted upon the true monarchs of the world those gems of divine virtue content with transitory dominion they have deprived themselves of an everlasting sovereignty thus their eyes beheld not the light of the countenance of the well beloved nor did their ears hearken unto the sweet melodies of the bird of desire for this reason in all sacred books mention hath been made of the divines of every age thus he saith “o people of the book why disbelieve the signs of god to which ye yourselves have been witnesses and also he saith “o people of the book why clothe ye the truth with falsehood why wittingly hide the truth again he saith “say people of the book why repel believers from the way of god it is evident that by the “people of the book who have repelled their fellowmen from the straight path of god is meant none other than the divines of that age whose names and character have been revealed in the sacred books and alluded to in the verses and traditions recorded therein were you to observe with the eye of god with fixed and steady gaze born of the unerring eye of god scan for while the horizon of divine knowledge and contemplate those words of perfection which the eternal hath revealed that haply the mysteries of divine wisdom hidden ere now beneath the veil of glory and treasured within the tabernacle of his grace may be made manifest unto you the denials and protestations of these leaders of religion have in the main been due to their lack of knowledge and understanding those words uttered by the revealers of the beauty of the one true god setting forth the signs that should herald the advent of the manifestation to come they never understood nor fathomed hence they raised the standard of revolt and stirred up mischief and sedition it is obvious and manifest that the true meaning of the utterances of the birds of eternity is revealed to none except those that manifest the eternal being and the melodies of the nightingale of holiness can reach no ear save that of the denizens of the everlasting realm the copt of tyranny can never partake of the cup touched by the lips of the sept of justice and the pharaoh of unbelief can never hope to recognize the hand of the moses of truth even as he saith “none knoweth the meaning thereof except god and them that are well grounded in knowledge and yet they have sought the interpretation of the book from those that are wrapt in veils and have refused to seek enlightenment from the fountainhead of knowledge and when the days of moses were ended and the light of jesus shining forth from the dayspring of the spirit encompassed the world all the people of israel arose in protest against him they clamored that he whose advent the bible had foretold must needs promulgate and fulfill the laws of moses whereas this youthful nazarene who laid claim to the station of the divine messiah had annulled the law of divorce and of the sabbath day—the most weighty of all the laws of moses moreover what of the signs of the manifestation yet to come these people of israel are even unto the present day still expecting that manifestation which the bible hath foretold how many manifestations of holiness how many revealers of the light everlasting have appeared since the time of moses and yet israel wrapt in the densest veils of satanic fancy and false imaginings is still expectant that the idol of her own handiwork will appear with such signs as she herself hath conceived thus hath god laid hold of them for their sins hath extinguished in them the spirit of faith and tormented them with the flames of the nethermost fire and this for no other reason except that israel refused to apprehend the meaning of such words as have been revealed in the bible concerning the signs of the coming revelation as she never grasped their true significance and to outward seeming such events never came to pass she therefore remained deprived of recognizing the beauty of jesus and of beholding the face of god and they still await his coming from time immemorial even unto this day all the kindreds and peoples of the earth have clung to such fanciful and unseemly thoughts and thus have deprived themselves of the clear waters streaming from the springs of purity and holiness in unfolding these mysteries we have in our former tablets which were addressed to friend in the melodious language of ḥijáz cited few of the verses revealed unto the prophets of old and now responding to your request we again shall cite in these pages those same verses uttered this time in the wondrous accents of ‘iráq that haply the sore athirst in the wilds of remoteness may attain unto the ocean of the divine presence and they that languish in the wastes of separation be led unto the home of eternal reunion thus the mists of error may be dispelled and the all resplendent light of divine guidance dawn forth above the horizon of human hearts in god we put our trust and to him we cry for help that haply there may flow from this pen that which shall quicken the souls of men that they may all arise from their beds of heedlessness and hearken unto the rustling of the leaves of paradise from the tree which the hand of divine power hath by the permission of god planted in the riḍván of the all glorious to them that are endowed with understanding it is clear and manifest that when the fire of the love of jesus consumed the veils of jewish limitations and his authority was made apparent and partially enforced he the revealer of the unseen beauty addressing one day his disciples referred unto his passing and kindling in their hearts the fire of bereavement said unto them “i go away and come again unto you and in another place he said “i go and another will come who will tell you all that have not told you and will fulfill all that have said both these sayings have but one meaning were you to ponder upon the manifestations of the unity of god with divine insight every discerning observer will recognize that in the dispensation of the qur’án both the book and the cause of jesus were confirmed as to the matter of names muḥammad himself declared “i am jesus he recognized the truth of the signs prophecies and words of jesus and testified that they were all of god in this sense neither the person of jesus nor his writings hath differed from that of muḥammad and of his holy book inasmuch as both have championed the cause of god uttered his praise and revealed his commandments thus it is that jesus himself declared “i go away and come again unto you consider the sun were it to say now “i am the sun of yesterday it would speak the truth and should it bearing the sequence of time in mind claim to be other than that sun it still would speak the truth in like manner if it be said that all the days are but one and the same it is correct and true and if it be said with respect to their particular names and designations that they differ that again is true for though they are the same yet one doth recognize in each separate designation specific attribute particular character conceive accordingly the distinction variation and unity characteristic of the various manifestations of holiness that thou mayest comprehend the allusions made by the creator of all names and attributes to the mysteries of distinction and unity and discover the answer to thy question as to why that everlasting beauty should have at sundry times called himself by different names and titles afterwards the companions and disciples of jesus asked him concerning those signs that must needs signalize the return of his manifestation when they asked shall these things be several times they questioned that peerless beauty and every time he made reply he set forth special sign that should herald the advent of the promised dispensation to this testify the records of the four gospels this wronged one will cite but one of these instances thus conferring upon mankind for the sake of god such bounties as are yet concealed within the treasury of the hidden and sacred tree that haply mortal men may not remain deprived of their share of the immortal fruit and attain to dewdrop of the waters of everlasting life which from baghdád the “abode of peace are being vouchsafed unto all mankind we ask for neither meed nor reward “we nourish your souls for the sake of god we seek from you neither recompense nor thanks this is the food that conferreth everlasting life upon the pure in heart and the illumined in spirit this is the bread of which it is said “lord send down upon us thy bread from heaven this bread shall never be withheld from them that deserve it nor can it ever be exhausted it groweth everlastingly from the tree of grace it descendeth at all seasons from the heavens of justice and mercy even as he saith “seest thou not to what god likeneth good word to good tree its root firmly fixed and its branches reaching unto heaven yielding its fruit in all seasons the pity that man should deprive himself of this goodly gift this imperishable bounty this everlasting life it behooveth him to prize this food that cometh from heaven that perchance through the wondrous favors of the sun of truth the dead may be brought to life and withered souls be quickened by the infinite spirit make haste my brother that while there is yet time our lips may taste of the immortal draft for the breeze of life now blowing from the city of the well beloved cannot last and the streaming river of holy utterance must needs be stilled and the portals of the riḍván cannot forever remain open the day will surely come when the nightingale of paradise will have winged its flight away from its earthly abode unto its heavenly nest then will its melody be heard no more and the beauty of the rose cease to shine seize the time therefore ere the glory of the divine springtime hath spent itself and the bird of eternity ceased to warble its melody that thy inner hearing may not be deprived of hearkening unto its call this is my counsel unto thee and unto the beloved of god whosoever wisheth let him turn thereunto whosoever wisheth let him turn away god verily is independent of him and of that which he may see and witness these are the melodies sung by jesus son of mary in accents of majestic power in the riḍván of the gospel revealing those signs that must needs herald the advent of the manifestation after him in the first gospel according to matthew it is recorded and when they asked jesus concerning the signs of his coming he said unto them “immediately after the oppression of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of the earth shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory and he shall send his angels with great sound of trumpet rendered into the persian tongue the purport of these words is as follows when the oppression and afflictions that are to befall mankind will have come to pass then shall the sun be withheld from shining the moon from giving light the stars of heaven shall fall upon the earth and the pillars of the earth shall quake at that time the signs of the son of man shall appear in heaven that is the promised beauty and substance of life shall when these signs have appeared step forth out of the realm of the invisible into the visible world and he saith at that time all the peoples and kindreds that dwell on earth shall bewail and lament and they shall see that divine beauty coming from heaven riding upon the clouds with power grandeur and magnificence sending his angels with great sound of trumpet similarly in the three other gospels according to luke mark and john the same statements are recorded as we have referred at length to these in our tablets revealed in the arabic tongue we have made no mention of them in these pages and have confined ourselves to but one reference inasmuch as the christian divines have failed to apprehend the meaning of these words and did not recognize their object and purpose and have clung to the literal interpretation of the words of jesus they therefore became deprived of the streaming grace of the muḥammadan revelation and its showering bounties the ignorant among the christian community following the example of the leaders of their faith were likewise prevented from beholding the beauty of the king of glory inasmuch as those signs which were to accompany the dawn of the sun of the muḥammadan dispensation did not actually come to pass thus ages have passed and centuries rolled away and that most pure spirit hath repaired unto the retreats of its ancient sovereignty once more hath the eternal spirit breathed into the mystic trumpet and caused the dead to speed out of their sepulchers of heedlessness and error unto the realm of guidance and grace and yet that expectant community still crieth out when shall these things be when shall the promised one the object of our expectation be made manifest that we may arise for the triumph of his cause that we may sacrifice our substance for his sake that we may offer up our lives in his path in like manner have such false imaginings caused other communities to stray from the kawthar of the infinite mercy of providence and to be busied with their own idle thoughts beside this passage there is yet another verse in the gospel wherein he saith “heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away thus it is that the adherents of jesus maintained that the law of the gospel shall never be annulled and that whensoever the promised beauty is made manifest and all the signs are revealed he must needs reaffirm and establish the law proclaimed in the gospel so that there may remain in the world no faith but his faith this is their fundamental belief and their conviction is such that were person to be made manifest with all the promised signs and to promulgate that which is contrary to the letter of the law of the gospel they must assuredly renounce him refuse to submit to his law declare him an infidel and laugh him to scorn this is proved by that which came to pass when the sun of the muḥammadan revelation was revealed had they sought with humble mind from the manifestations of god in every dispensation the true meaning of these words revealed in the sacred books—words the misapprehension of which hath caused men to be deprived of the recognition of the sadratu’l muntahá the ultimate purpose—they surely would have been guided to the light of the sun of truth and would have discovered the mysteries of divine knowledge and wisdom this servant will now share with thee dewdrop out of the fathomless ocean of the truths treasured in these holy words that haply discerning hearts may comprehend all the allusions and the implications of the utterances of the manifestations of holiness so that the overpowering majesty of the word of god may not prevent them from attaining unto the ocean of his names and attributes nor deprive them of recognizing the lamp of god which is the seat of the revelation of his glorified essence as to the words—“immediately after the oppression of those days”—they refer to the time when men shall become oppressed and afflicted the time when the lingering traces of the sun of truth and the fruit of the tree of knowledge and wisdom will have vanished from the midst of men when the reins of mankind will have fallen into the grasp of the foolish and ignorant when the portals of divine unity and understanding—the essential and highest purpose in creation—will have been closed when certain knowledge will have given way to idle fancy and corruption will have usurped the station of righteousness such condition as this is witnessed in this day when the reins of every community have fallen into the grasp of foolish leaders who lead after their own whims and desire on their tongue the mention of god hath become an empty name in their midst his holy word dead letter such is the sway of their desires that the lamp of conscience and reason hath been quenched in their hearts and this although the fingers of divine power have unlocked the portals of the knowledge of god and the light of divine knowledge and heavenly grace hath illumined and inspired the essence of all created things in such wise that in each and every thing door of knowledge hath been opened and within every atom traces of the sun have been made manifest and yet in spite of all these manifold revelations of divine knowledge which have encompassed the world they still vainly imagine the door of knowledge to be closed and the showers of mercy to be stilled clinging unto idle fancy they have strayed far from the ‘urvatu’l vuthqá of divine knowledge their hearts seem not to be inclined to knowledge and the door thereof neither think they of its manifestations inasmuch as in idle fancy they have found the door that leadeth unto earthly riches whereas in the manifestation of the revealer of knowledge they find naught but the call to self sacrifice they therefore naturally hold fast unto the former and flee from the latter though they recognize in their hearts the law of god to be one and the same yet from every direction they issue new command and in every season proclaim fresh decree no two are found to agree on one and the same law for they seek no god but their own desire and tread no path but the path of error in leadership they have recognized the ultimate object of their endeavor and account pride and haughtiness as the highest attainments of their heart’s desire they have placed their sordid machinations above the divine decree have renounced resignation unto the will of god busied themselves with selfish calculation and walked in the way of the hypocrite with all their power and strength they strive to secure themselves in their petty pursuits fearful lest the least discredit undermine their authority or blemish the display of their magnificence were the eye to be anointed and illumined with the collyrium of the knowledge of god it would surely discover that number of voracious beasts have gathered and preyed upon the carrion of the souls of men what “oppression” is greater than that which hath been recounted what “oppression” is more grievous than that soul seeking the truth and wishing to attain unto the knowledge of god should know not where to go for it and from whom to seek it for opinions have sorely differed and the ways unto the attainment of god have multiplied this “oppression” is the essential feature of every revelation unless it cometh to pass the sun of truth will not be made manifest for the break of the morn of divine guidance must needs follow the darkness of the night of error for this reason in all chronicles and traditions reference hath been made unto these things namely that iniquity shall cover the surface of the earth and darkness shall envelop mankind as the traditions referred to are well known and as the purpose of this servant is to be brief he will refrain from quoting the text of these traditions were this “oppression” which literally meaneth pressure to be interpreted that the earth is to become contracted or were men’s idle fancy to conceive similar calamities to befall mankind it is clear and manifest that no such happenings can ever come to pass they will assuredly protest that this prerequisite of divine revelation hath not been made manifest such hath been and still is their contention whereas by “oppression” is meant the want of capacity to acquire spiritual knowledge and apprehend the word of god by it is meant that when the daystar of truth hath set and the mirrors that reflect his light have departed mankind will become afflicted with “oppression” and hardship knowing not whither to turn for guidance thus we instruct thee in the interpretation of the traditions and reveal unto thee the mysteries of divine wisdom that haply thou mayest comprehend the meaning thereof and be of them that have quaffed the cup of divine knowledge and understanding and now concerning his words—“the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give light and the stars shall fall from heaven by the terms “sun” and “moon mentioned in the writings of the prophets of god is not meant solely the sun and moon of the visible universe nay rather manifold are the meanings they have intended for these terms in every instance they have attached to them particular significance thus by the “sun” in one sense is meant those suns of truth who rise from the dayspring of ancient glory and fill the world with liberal effusion of grace from on high these suns of truth are the universal manifestations of god in the worlds of his attributes and names even as the visible sun that assisteth as decreed by god the true one the adored in the development of all earthly things such as the trees the fruits and colors thereof the minerals of the earth and all that may be witnessed in the world of creation so do the divine luminaries by their loving care and educative influence cause the trees of divine unity the fruits of his oneness the leaves of detachment the blossoms of knowledge and certitude and the myrtles of wisdom and utterance to exist and be made manifest thus it is that through the rise of these luminaries of god the world is made new the waters of everlasting life stream forth the billows of loving kindness surge the clouds of grace are gathered and the breeze of bounty bloweth upon all created things it is the warmth that these luminaries of god generate and the undying fires they kindle which cause the light of the love of god to burn fiercely in the heart of humanity it is through the abundant grace of these symbols of detachment that the spirit of life everlasting is breathed into the bodies of the dead assuredly the visible sun is but sign of the splendor of that daystar of truth that sun which can never have peer likeness or rival through him all things live move and have their being through his grace they are made manifest and unto him they all return from him all things have sprung and unto the treasuries of his revelation they all have repaired from him all created things did proceed and to the depositories of his law they did revert that these divine luminaries seem to be confined at times to specific designations and attributes as you have observed and are now observing is due solely to the imperfect and limited comprehension of certain minds otherwise they have been at all times and will through eternity continue to be exalted above every praising name and sanctified from every descriptive attribute the quintessence of every name can hope for no access unto their court of holiness and the highest and purest of all attributes can never approach their kingdom of glory immeasurably high are the prophets of god exalted above the comprehension of men who can never know them except by their own selves far be it from his glory that his chosen ones should be magnified by any other than their own persons glorified are they above the praise of men exalted are they above human understanding the term “suns” hath many time been applied in the writings of the “immaculate souls” unto the prophets of god those luminous emblems of detachment among those writings are the following words recorded in the “prayer of nudbih” “whither are gone the resplendent suns whereunto have departed those shining moons and sparkling stars thus it hath become evident that the terms “sun “moon and “stars” primarily signify the prophets of god the saints and their companions those luminaries the light of whose knowledge hath shed illumination upon the worlds of the visible and the invisible in another sense by these terms is intended the divines of the former dispensation who live in the days of the subsequent revelations and who hold the reins of religion in their grasp if these divines be illumined by the light of the latter revelation they will be acceptable unto god and will shine with light everlasting otherwise they will be declared as darkened even though to outward seeming they be leaders of men inasmuch as belief and unbelief guidance and error felicity and misery light and darkness are all dependent upon the sanction of him who is the daystar of truth whosoever among the divines of every age receiveth in the day of reckoning the testimony of faith from the source of true knowledge he verily becometh the recipient of learning of divine favor and of the light of true understanding otherwise he is branded as guilty of folly denial blasphemy and oppression it is evident and manifest unto every discerning observer that even as the light of the star fadeth before the effulgent splendor of the sun so doth the luminary of earthly knowledge of wisdom and understanding vanish into nothingness when brought face to face with the resplendent glories of the sun of truth the daystar of divine enlightenment that the term “sun” hath been applied to the leaders of religion is due to their lofty position their fame and renown such are the universally recognized divines of every age who speak with authority and whose fame is securely established if they be in the likeness of the sun of truth they will surely be accounted as the most exalted of all luminaries otherwise they are to be recognized as the focal centers of hellish fire even as he saith “verily the sun and the moon are both condemned to the torment of infernal fire you are no doubt familiar with the interpretation of the term “sun” and “moon” mentioned in this verse no need therefore to refer unto it and whosoever is of the element of this “sun” and “moon that is followeth the example of these leaders in setting his face towards falsehood and in turning away from the truth he undoubtedly cometh out of infernal gloom and returneth thereunto and now seeker it behooveth us firmly to cling unto the ‘urvatu’l vuthqá that perchance we may leave behind the darksome night of error and embrace the dawning light of divine guidance shall we not flee from the face of denial and seek the sheltering shadow of certitude shall we not free ourselves from the horror of satanic gloom and hasten towards the rising light of the heavenly beauty in such wise we bestow upon you the fruit of the tree of divine knowledge that ye may gladly and joyously abide in the riḍván of divine wisdom in another sense by the terms “sun “moon and “stars” are meant such laws and teachings as have been established and proclaimed in every dispensation such as the laws of prayer and fasting these have according to the law of the qur’án been regarded when the beauty of the prophet muḥammad had passed beyond the veil as the most fundamental and binding laws of his dispensation to this testify the texts of the traditions and chronicles which on account of their being widely known need not be referred to here nay rather in every dispensation the law concerning prayer hath been emphasized and universally enforced to this testify the recorded traditions ascribed to the lights that have emanated from the daystar of truth the essence of the prophet muḥammad the traditions established the fact that in all dispensations the law of prayer hath constituted fundamental element of the revelation of all the prophets of god—a law the form and the manner of which hath been adapted to the varying requirements of every age inasmuch as every subsequent revelation hath abolished the manners habits and teachings that have been clearly specifically and firmly established by the former dispensation these have accordingly been symbolically expressed in terms of “sun” and “moon “that he might prove you which of you excel in deeds moreover in the traditions the terms “sun” and “moon” have been applied to prayer and fasting even as it is said “fasting is illumination prayer is light one day well known divine came to visit us while we were conversing with him he referred to the above quoted tradition he said “inasmuch as fasting causeth the heat of the body to increase it hath therefore been likened unto the light of the sun and as the prayer of the night season refresheth man it hath been compared unto the radiance of the moon thereupon we realized that that poor man had not been favored with single drop of the ocean of true understanding and had strayed far from the burning bush of divine wisdom we then politely observed to him saying “the interpretation your honor hath given to this tradition is the one current amongst the people could it not be interpreted differently he asked us “what could it be we made reply “muḥammad the seal of the prophets and the most distinguished of god’s chosen ones hath likened the dispensation of the qur’án unto heaven by reason of its loftiness its paramount influence its majesty and the fact that it comprehendeth all religions and as the sun and moon constitute the brightest and most prominent luminaries in the heavens similarly in the heaven of the religion of god two shining orbs have been ordained—fasting and prayer ‘islám is heaven fasting is its sun prayer its moon ’” this is the purpose underlying the symbolic words of the manifestations of god consequently the application of the terms “sun” and “moon” to the things already mentioned hath been demonstrated and justified by the text of the sacred verses and the recorded traditions hence it is clear and manifest that by the words “the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven” is intended the waywardness of the divines and the annulment of laws firmly established by divine revelation all of which in symbolic language have been foreshadowed by the manifestation of god none except the righteous shall partake of this cup none but the godly can share therein “the righteous shall drink of cup tempered at the camphor fountain it is unquestionable that in every succeeding revelation the “sun” and “moon” of the teachings laws commandments and prohibitions which have been established in the preceding dispensation and which have overshadowed the people of that age become darkened that is are exhausted and cease to exert their influence consider now had the people of the gospel recognized the meaning of the symbolic terms “sun” and “moon had they sought unlike the froward and perverse enlightenment from him who is the revealer of divine knowledge they would have surely comprehended the purpose of these terms and would not have become afflicted and oppressed by the darkness of their selfish desires yea but since they have failed to acquire true knowledge from its very source they have perished in the perilous vale of waywardness and misbelief they still have not awakened to perceive that all the signs foretold have been made manifest that the promised sun hath risen above the horizon of divine revelation and that the “sun” and “moon” of the teachings the laws and learning of former dispensation have darkened and set and now with fixed gaze and steady wings enter thou the way of certitude and truth “say it is god then leave them to entertain themselves with their cavilings thus wilt thou be accounted of those companions of whom he saith “they that say ‘our lord is god and continue steadfast in his way upon them verily shall the angels descend then shalt thou witness all these mysteries with thine own eyes my brother take thou the step of the spirit so that swift as the twinkling of an eye thou mayest flash through the wilds of remoteness and bereavement attain the riḍván of everlasting reunion and in one breath commune with the heavenly spirits for with human feet thou canst never hope to traverse these immeasurable distances nor attain thy goal peace be upon him whom the light of truth guideth unto all truth and who in the name of god standeth in the path of his cause upon the shore of true understanding this is the meaning of the sacred verse “but nay swear by the lord of the easts and the wests inasmuch as the “suns” referred to have each their own particular rising and setting place and as the commentators of the qur’án have failed to grasp the symbolic meaning of these “suns they therefore were at pains to interpret the above quoted verse some of them maintained that owing to the fact that the sun each day rises from different point the terms “easts” and “wests” have been mentioned in the plural others have written that by this verse the four seasons of the year are intended inasmuch as the dawning and setting points of the sun vary with the change of the seasons such is the depth of their understanding nonetheless they persist in imputing error and folly to those gems of knowledge those irreproachable and purest symbols of wisdom in like manner strive thou to comprehend from these lucid these powerful conclusive and unequivocal statements the meaning of the “cleaving of the heaven”—one of the signs that must needs herald the coming of the last hour the day of resurrection as he hath said “when the heaven shall be cloven asunder by “heaven” is meant the heaven of divine revelation which is elevated with every manifestation and rent asunder with every subsequent one by “cloven asunder” is meant that the former dispensation is superseded and annulled swear by god that this heaven being cloven asunder is to the discerning an act mightier than the cleaving of the skies ponder while that divine revelation which for years hath been securely established beneath whose shadow all who have embraced it have been reared and nurtured by the light of whose law generations of men have been disciplined the excellency of whose word men have heard recounted by their fathers in such wise that human eye hath beheld naught but the pervading influence of its grace and mortal ear hath heard naught but the resounding majesty of its command—what act is mightier than that such revelation should by the power of god be “cloven asunder” and be abolished at the appearance of one soul reflect is this mightier act than that which these abject and foolish men have imagined the “cleaving of the heaven” to mean moreover consider the hardships and the bitterness of the lives of those revealers of the divine beauty reflect how single handed and alone they faced the world and all its peoples and promulgated the law of god no matter how severe the persecutions inflicted upon those holy those precious and tender souls they still remained in the plenitude of their power patient and despite their ascendancy they suffered and endured in like manner endeavor to comprehend the meaning of the “changing of the earth know thou that upon whatever hearts the bountiful showers of mercy raining from the “heaven” of divine revelation have fallen the earth of those hearts hath verily been changed into the earth of divine knowledge and wisdom what myrtles of unity hath the soil of their hearts produced what blossoms of true knowledge and wisdom hath their illumined bosoms yielded were the earth of their hearts to remain unchanged how could such souls who have not been taught one letter have seen no teacher and entered no school utter such words and display such knowledge as none can apprehend methinks they have been molded from the clay of infinite knowledge and kneaded with the water of divine wisdom therefore hath it been said “knowledge is light which god casteth into the heart of whomsoever he willeth it is this kind of knowledge which is and hath ever been praiseworthy and not the limited knowledge that hath sprung forth from veiled and obscured minds this limited knowledge they even stealthily borrow one from the other and vainly pride themselves therein would that the hearts of men could be cleansed from these manmade limitations and obscure thoughts imposed upon them haply they may be illumined by the light of the sun of true knowledge and comprehend the mysteries of divine wisdom consider now were the parched and barren soil of these hearts to remain unchanged how could they ever become the recipients of the revelation of the mysteries of god and the revealers of the divine essence thus hath he said “on the day when the earth shall be changed into another earth the breeze of the bounty of the king of creation hath caused even the physical earth to be changed were ye to ponder in your hearts the mysteries of divine revelation and now comprehend the meaning of this verse “the whole earth shall on the resurrection day be but his handful and in his right hand shall the heavens be folded together praise be to him and high be he uplifted above the partners they join with him and now be fair in thy judgment were this verse to have the meaning which men suppose it to have of what profit one may ask could it be to man moreover it is evident and manifest that no such hand as could be seen by human eye could accomplish such deeds or could possibly be ascribed to the exalted essence of the one true god nay to acknowledge such thing is naught but sheer blasphemy an utter perversion of the truth and should it be supposed that by this verse are meant the manifestations of god who will be called upon on the day of judgment to perform such deeds this too seemeth far from the truth and is surely of no profit on the contrary by the term “earth” is meant the earth of understanding and knowledge and by “heavens” the heavens of divine revelation reflect thou how in one hand he hath by his mighty grasp turned the earth of knowledge and understanding previously unfolded into mere handful and on the other spread out new and highly exalted earth in the hearts of men thus causing the freshest and loveliest blossoms and the mightiest and loftiest trees to spring forth from the illumined bosom of man in like manner reflect how the elevated heavens of the dispensations of the past have in the right hand of power been folded together how the heavens of divine revelation have been raised by the command of god and been adorned by the sun the moon and stars of his wondrous commandments such are the mysteries of the word of god which have been unveiled and made manifest that haply thou mayest apprehend the morning light of divine guidance mayest quench by the power of reliance and renunciation the lamp of idle fancy of vain imaginings of hesitation and doubt and mayest kindle in the inmost chamber of thine heart the newborn light of divine knowledge and certitude know verily that the purpose underlying all these symbolic terms and abstruse allusions which emanate from the revealers of god’s holy cause hath been to test and prove the peoples of the world that thereby the earth of the pure and illuminated hearts may be known from the perishable and barren soil from time immemorial such hath been the way of god amidst his creatures and to this testify the records of the sacred books and likewise reflect upon the revealed verse concerning the “qiblih when muḥammad the sun of prophethood had fled from the dayspring of baṭḥá unto yathrib he continued to turn his face while praying unto jerusalem the holy city until the time when the jews began to utter unseemly words against him—words which if mentioned would ill befit these pages and would weary the reader muḥammad strongly resented these words whilst wrapt in meditation and wonder he was gazing toward heaven he heard the kindly voice of gabriel saying “we behold thee from above turning thy face to heaven but we will have thee turn to qiblih which shall please thee ”⁠ on subsequent day when the prophet together with his companions was offering the noontide prayer and had already performed two of the prescribed rak‘ats the voice of gabriel was heard again “turn thou thy face towards the sacred mosque in the midst of that same prayer muḥammad suddenly turned his face away from jerusalem and faced the ka‘bih whereupon profound dismay seized suddenly the companions of the prophet their faith was shaken severely so great was their alarm that many of them discontinuing their prayer apostatized their faith verily god caused not this turmoil but to test and prove his servants otherwise he the ideal king could easily have left the qiblih unchanged and could have caused jerusalem to remain the point of adoration unto his dispensation thereby withholding not from that holy city the distinction of acceptance which had been conferred upon it none of the many prophets sent down since moses was made manifest as messengers of the word of god such as david jesus and others among the more exalted manifestations who have appeared during the intervening period between the revelations of moses and muḥammad ever altered the law of the qiblih these messengers of the lord of creation have one and all directed their peoples to turn unto the same direction in the eyes of god the ideal king all the places of the earth are one and the same excepting that place which in the days of his manifestations he doth appoint for particular purpose even as he hath revealed “the east and west are god’s therefore whichever way ye turn there is the face of god notwithstanding the truth of these facts why should the qiblih have been changed thus casting such dismay amongst the people causing the companions of the prophet to waver and throwing so great confusion into their midst yea such things as throw consternation into the hearts of all men come to pass only that each soul may be tested by the touchstone of god that the true may be known and distinguished from the false thus hath he revealed after the breach amongst the people “we did not appoint that which thou wouldst have to be the qiblih but that we might know him who followeth the apostle from him who turneth on his heels “affrighted asses fleeing from lion were you to ponder but for while these utterances in your heart you would surely find the portals of understanding unlocked before your face and would behold all knowledge and the mysteries thereof unveiled before your eyes such things take place only that the souls of men may develop and be delivered from the prison cage of self and desire otherwise that ideal king hath throughout eternity been in his essence independent of the comprehension of all beings and will continue forever in his own being to be exalted above the adoration of every soul single breeze of his affluence doth suffice to adorn all mankind with the robe of wealth and one drop out of the ocean of his bountiful grace is enough to confer upon all beings the glory of everlasting life but inasmuch as the divine purpose hath decreed that the true should be known from the false and the sun from the shadow he hath therefore in every season sent down upon mankind the showers of tests from his realm of glory were men to meditate upon the lives of the prophets of old so easily would they come to know and understand the ways of these prophets that they would cease to be veiled by such deeds and words as are contrary to their own worldly desires and thus consume every intervening veil with the fire burning in the bush of divine knowledge and abide secure upon the throne of peace and certitude for instance consider moses son of ‘imrán one of the exalted prophets and author of divinely revealed book whilst passing one day through the market in his early days ere his ministry was proclaimed he saw two men engaged in fighting one of them asked the help of moses against his opponent whereupon moses intervened and slew him to this testifieth the record of the sacred book should the details be cited they will lengthen and interrupt the course of the argument the report of this incident spread throughout the city and moses was full of fear as is witnessed by the text of the book and when the warning “o moses of truth the chiefs take counsel to slay thee” reached his ears he went forth from the city and sojourned in midian in the service of shoeb while returning moses entered the holy vale situate in the wilderness of sinai and there beheld the vision of the king of glory from the “tree that belongeth neither to the east nor to the west there he heard the soul stirring voice of the spirit speaking from out of the kindled fire bidding him to shed upon pharaonic souls the light of divine guidance so that liberating them from the shadows of the valley of self and desire he might enable them to attain the meads of heavenly delight and delivering them through the salsabíl of renunciation from the bewilderment of remoteness cause them to enter the peaceful city of the divine presence when moses came unto pharaoh and delivered unto him as bidden by god the divine message pharaoh spoke insultingly saying “art thou not he that committed murder and became an infidel thus recounted the lord of majesty as having been said by pharaoh unto moses “what deed is that which thou hast done thou art one of the ungrateful he said ‘i did it indeed and was one of those who erred and fled from you when feared you but my lord hath given me wisdom and hath made me one of his apostles ’” and now ponder in thy heart the commotion which god stirreth up reflect upon the strange and manifold trials with which he doth test his servants consider how he hath suddenly chosen from among his servants and entrusted with the exalted mission of divine guidance him who was known as guilty of homicide who himself had acknowledged his cruelty and who for well nigh thirty years had in the eyes of the world been reared in the home of pharaoh and been nourished at his table was not god the omnipotent king able to withhold the hand of moses from murder so that manslaughter should not be attributed unto him causing bewilderment and aversion among the people likewise reflect upon the state and condition of mary so deep was the perplexity of that most beauteous countenance so grievous her case that she bitterly regretted she had ever been born to this beareth witness the text of the sacred verse wherein it is mentioned that after mary had given birth to jesus she bemoaned her plight and cried out “o would that had died ere this and been thing forgotten forgotten quite swear by god such lamenting consumeth the heart and shaketh the being such consternation of soul such despondency could have been caused by no other than the censure of the enemy and the cavilings of the infidel and perverse reflect what answer could mary have given to the people around her how could she claim that babe whose father was unknown had been conceived of the holy ghost therefore did mary that veiled and immortal countenance take up her child and return unto her home no sooner had the eyes of the people fallen upon her than they raised their voice saying “o sister of aaron thy father was not man of wickedness nor unchaste thy mother and now meditate upon this most great convulsion this grievous test notwithstanding all these things god conferred upon that essence of the spirit who was known amongst the people as fatherless the glory of prophethood and made him his testimony unto all that are in heaven and on earth behold how contrary are the ways of the manifestations of god as ordained by the king of creation to the ways and desires of men as thou comest to comprehend the essence of these divine mysteries thou wilt grasp the purpose of god the divine charmer the best beloved thou wilt regard the words and the deeds of that almighty sovereign as one and the same in such wise that whatsoever thou dost behold in his deeds the same wilt thou find in his sayings and whatsoever thou dost read in his sayings that wilt thou recognize in his deeds thus it is that outwardly such deeds and words are the fire of vengeance unto the wicked and inwardly the waters of mercy unto the righteous were the eye of the heart to open it would surely perceive that the words revealed from the heaven of the will of god are at one with and the same as the deeds that have emanated from the kingdom of divine power and now take heed brother if such things be revealed in this dispensation and such incidents come to pass at the present time what would the people do swear by him who is the true educator of mankind and the revealer of the word of god that the people would instantly and unquestionably pronounce him an infidel and would sentence him to death how far are they from hearkening unto the voice that declareth lo jesus hath appeared out of the breath of the holy ghost and moses summoned to divinely appointed task were myriad voices to be raised no ear would listen if we said that upon fatherless child hath been conferred the mission of prophethood or that murderer hath brought from the flame of the burning bush the message of “verily verily am god if the eye of justice be opened it will readily recognize in the light of that which hath been mentioned that he who is the cause and ultimate purpose of all these things is made manifest in this day though similar events have not occurred in this dispensation yet the people still cling to such vain imaginings as are cherished by the reprobate how grievous the charges brought against him how severe the persecutions inflicted upon him—charges and persecutions the like of which men have neither seen nor heard great god when the stream of utterance reached this stage we beheld and lo the sweet savors of god were being wafted from the dayspring of revelation and the morning breeze was blowing out of the sheba of the eternal its tidings rejoiced anew the heart and imparted immeasurable gladness to the soul it made all things new and brought unnumbered and inestimable gifts from the unknowable friend the robe of human praise can never hope to match its noble stature and its shining figure the mantle of utterance can never fit without word it unfoldeth the inner mysteries and without speech it revealeth the secrets of the divine sayings it teacheth lamentation and moaning to the nightingales warbling upon the bough of remoteness and bereavement instructeth them in the art of love’s ways and showeth them the secret of heart surrender to the flowers of the riḍván of heavenly reunion it revealeth the endearments of the impassioned lover and unveileth the charm of the fair upon the anemones of the garden of love it bestoweth the mysteries of truth and within the breasts of lovers it entrusteth the symbols of the innermost subtleties at this hour so liberal is the outpouring of its grace that the holy spirit itself is envious it hath imparted to the drop the waves of the sea and endowed the mote with the splendor of the sun so great are the overflowings of its bounty that the foulest beetle hath sought the perfume of the musk and the bat the light of the sun it hath quickened the dead with the breath of life and caused them to speed out of the sepulchers of their mortal bodies it hath established the ignorant upon the seats of learning and elevated the oppressor to the throne of justice the universe is pregnant with these manifold bounties awaiting the hour when the effects of its unseen gifts will be made manifest in this world when the languishing and sore athirst will attain the living kawthar of their well beloved and the erring wanderer lost in the wilds of remoteness and nothingness will enter the tabernacle of life and attain reunion with his heart’s desire in the soil of whose heart will these holy seeds germinate from the garden of whose soul will the blossoms of the invisible realities spring forth verily say so fierce is the blaze of the bush of love burning in the sinai of the heart that the streaming waters of holy utterance can never quench its flame oceans can never allay this leviathan’s burning thirst and this phoenix of the undying fire can abide nowhere save in the glow of the countenance of the well beloved therefore brother kindle with the oil of wisdom the lamp of the spirit within the innermost chamber of thy heart and guard it with the globe of understanding that the breath of the infidel may extinguish not its flame nor dim its brightness thus have we illuminated the heavens of utterance with the splendors of the sun of divine wisdom and understanding that thy heart may find peace that thou mayest be of those who on the wings of certitude have soared unto the heaven of the love of their lord the all merciful and now concerning his words “and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven by these words it is meant that when the sun of the heavenly teachings hath been eclipsed the stars of the divinely established laws have fallen and the moon of true knowledge—the educator of mankind—hath been obscured when the standards of guidance and felicity have been reversed and the morn of truth and righteousness hath sunk in night then shall the sign of the son of man appear in heaven by “heaven” is meant the visible heaven inasmuch as when the hour draweth nigh on which the daystar of the heaven of justice shall be made manifest and the ark of divine guidance shall sail upon the sea of glory star will appear in the heaven heralding unto its people the advent of that most great light in like manner in the invisible heaven star shall be made manifest who unto the peoples of the earth shall act as harbinger of the break of that true and exalted morn these twofold signs in the visible and the invisible heaven have announced the revelation of each of the prophets of god as is commonly believed among the prophets was abraham the friend of god ere he manifested himself nimrod dreamed dream thereupon he summoned the soothsayers who informed him of the rise of star in the heaven likewise there appeared herald who announced throughout the land the coming of abraham after him came moses he who held converse with god the soothsayers of his time warned pharaoh in these terms “a star hath risen in the heaven and lo it foreshadoweth the conception of child who holdeth your fate and the fate of your people in his hand in like manner there appeared sage who in the darkness of the night brought tidings of joy unto the people of israel imparting consolation to their souls and assurance to their hearts to this testify the records of the sacred books were the details to be mentioned this epistle would swell into book moreover it is not our wish to relate the stories of the days that are past god is our witness that what we even now mention is due solely to our tender affection for thee that haply the poor of the earth may attain the shores of the sea of wealth the ignorant be led unto the ocean of divine knowledge and they that thirst for understanding partake of the salsabíl of divine wisdom otherwise this servant regardeth the consideration of such records grave mistake and grievous transgression in like manner when the hour of the revelation of jesus drew nigh few of the magi aware that the star of jesus had appeared in heaven sought and followed it till they came unto the city which was the seat of the kingdom of herod the sway of his sovereignty in those days embraced the whole of that land these magi said “where is he that is born king of the jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him when they had searched they found out that in bethlehem in the land of judea the child had been born this was the sign that was manifested in the visible heaven as to the sign in the invisible heaven—the heaven of divine knowledge and understanding—it was yaḥyá son of zachariah who gave unto the people the tidings of the manifestation of jesus even as he hath revealed “god announceth yaḥyá to thee who shall bear witness unto the word from god and great one and chaste by the term “word” is meant jesus whose coming yaḥyá foretold moreover in the heavenly scriptures it is written “john the baptist was preaching in the wilderness of judea and saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand by john is meant yaḥyá likewise ere the beauty of muḥammad was unveiled the signs of the visible heaven were made manifest as to the signs of the invisible heaven there appeared four men who successively announced unto the people the joyful tidings of the rise of that divine luminary rúz bih later named salmán was honored by being in their service as the end of one of these approached he would send rúz bih unto the other until the fourth who feeling his death to be nigh addressed rúz bih saying “o rúz bih when thou hast taken up my body and buried it go to ḥijáz for there the daystar of muḥammad will arise happy art thou for thou shalt behold his face and now concerning this wondrous and most exalted cause know thou verily that many an astronomer hath announced the appearance of its star in the visible heaven likewise there appeared on earth aḥmad and káẓim those twin resplendent lights—may god sanctify their resting place from all that we have stated it hath become clear and manifest that before the revelation of each of the mirrors reflecting the divine essence the signs heralding their advent must needs be revealed in the visible heaven as well as in the invisible wherein is the seat of the sun of knowledge of the moon of wisdom and of the stars of understanding and utterance the sign of the invisible heaven must needs be revealed in the person of that perfect man who before each manifestation appeareth educateth and prepareth the souls of men for the advent of the divine luminary the light of the unity of god amongst men and now with reference to his words “and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory these words signify that in those days men will lament the loss of the sun of the divine beauty of the moon of knowledge and of the stars of divine wisdom thereupon they will behold the countenance of the promised one the adored beauty descending from heaven and riding upon the clouds by this is meant that the divine beauty will be made manifest from the heaven of the will of god and will appear in the form of the human temple the term “heaven” denoteth loftiness and exaltation inasmuch as it is the seat of the revelation of those manifestations of holiness the daysprings of ancient glory these ancient beings though delivered from the womb of their mother have in reality descended from the heaven of the will of god though they be dwelling on this earth yet their true habitations are the retreats of glory in the realms above whilst walking amongst mortals they soar in the heaven of the divine presence without feet they tread the path of the spirit and without wings they rise unto the exalted heights of divine unity with every fleeting breath they cover the immensity of space and at every moment traverse the kingdoms of the visible and the invisible upon their thrones is written “nothing whatsoever keepeth him from being occupied with any other thing” and on their seats is inscribed “verily his ways differ every day they are sent forth through the transcendent power of the ancient of days and are raised up by the exalted will of god the most mighty king this is what is meant by the words “coming in the clouds of heaven in the utterances of the divine luminaries the term “heaven” hath been applied to many and divers things such as the “heaven of command the “heaven of will the “heaven of the divine purpose the “heaven of divine knowledge the “heaven of certitude the “heaven of utterance the “heaven of revelation the “heaven of concealment and the like in every instance he hath given the term “heaven” special meaning the significance of which is revealed to none save those that have been initiated into the divine mysteries and have drunk from the chalice of immortal life for example he saith “the heaven hath sustenance for you and it containeth that which you are promised” whereas it is the earth that yieldeth such sustenance likewise it hath been said “the names come down from heaven” whereas they proceed out of the mouth of men wert thou to cleanse the mirror of thy heart from the dust of malice thou wouldst apprehend the meaning of the symbolic terms revealed by the all embracing word of god made manifest in every dispensation and wouldst discover the mysteries of divine knowledge not however until thou consumest with the flame of utter detachment those veils of idle learning that are current amongst men canst thou behold the resplendent morn of true knowledge know verily that knowledge is of two kinds divine and satanic the one welleth out from the fountain of divine inspiration the other is but reflection of vain and obscure thoughts the source of the former is god himself the motive force of the latter the whisperings of selfish desire the one is guided by the principle “fear ye god god will teach you” the other is but confirmation of the truth “knowledge is the most grievous veil between man and his creator the former bringeth forth the fruit of patience of longing desire of true understanding and love whilst the latter can yield naught but arrogance vainglory and conceit from the sayings of those masters of holy utterance who have expounded the meaning of true knowledge the odor of these dark teachings which have obscured the world can in no wise be detected the tree of such teachings can yield no result except iniquity and rebellion and beareth no fruit but hatred and envy its fruit is deadly poison its shadow consuming fire how well hath it been said “cling unto the robe of the desire of thy heart and put thou away all shame bid the worldly wise be gone however great their name the heart must needs therefore be cleansed from the idle sayings of men and sanctified from every earthly affection so that it may discover the hidden meaning of divine inspiration and become the treasury of the mysteries of divine knowledge thus hath it been said “he that treadeth the snow white path and followeth in the footsteps of the crimson pillar shall never attain unto his abode unless his hands are empty of those worldly things cherished by men this is the prime requisite of whosoever treadeth this path ponder thereon that with eyes unveiled thou mayest perceive the truth of these words we have digressed from the purpose of our argument although whatsoever is mentioned serveth only to confirm our purpose by god however great our desire to be brief yet we feel we cannot restrain our pen notwithstanding all that we have mentioned how innumerable are the pearls which have remained unpierced in the shell of our heart how many the ḥúrís of inner meaning that are as yet concealed within the chambers of divine wisdom none hath yet approached them —ḥúrís “whom no man nor spirit hath touched before notwithstanding all that hath been said it seemeth as if not one letter of our purpose hath been uttered nor single sign divulged concerning our object when will faithful seeker be found who will don the garb of pilgrimage attain the ka‘bih of the heart’s desire and without ear or tongue discover the mysteries of divine utterance by these luminous these conclusive and lucid statements the meaning of “heaven” in the aforementioned verse hath thus been made clear and evident and now regarding his words that the son of man shall “come in the clouds of heaven by the term “clouds” is meant those things that are contrary to the ways and desires of men even as he hath revealed in the verse already quoted “as oft as an apostle cometh unto you with that which your souls desire not ye swell with pride accusing some of being impostors and slaying others these “clouds” signify in one sense the annulment of laws the abrogation of former dispensations the repeal of rituals and customs current amongst men the exalting of the illiterate faithful above the learned opposers of the faith in another sense they mean the appearance of that immortal beauty in the image of mortal man with such human limitations as eating and drinking poverty and riches glory and abasement sleeping and waking and such other things as cast doubt in the minds of men and cause them to turn away all such veils are symbolically referred to as “clouds these are the “clouds” that cause the heavens of the knowledge and understanding of all that dwell on earth to be cloven asunder even as he hath revealed “on that day shall the heaven be cloven by the clouds even as the clouds prevent the eyes of men from beholding the sun so do these things hinder the souls of men from recognizing the light of the divine luminary to this beareth witness that which hath proceeded out of the mouth of the unbelievers as revealed in the sacred book “and they have said ‘what manner of apostle is this he eateth food and walketh the streets unless an angel be sent down and take part in his warnings we will not believe ’” other prophets similarly have been subject to poverty and afflictions to hunger and to the ills and chances of this world as these holy persons were subject to such needs and wants the people were consequently lost in the wilds of misgivings and doubts and were afflicted with bewilderment and perplexity how they wondered could such person be sent down from god assert his ascendancy over all the peoples and kindreds of the earth and claim himself to be the goal of all creation—even as he hath said “but for thee would not have created all that are in heaven and on earth”—and yet be subject to such trivial things you must undoubtedly have been informed of the tribulations the poverty the ills and the degradation that have befallen every prophet of god and his companions you must have heard how the heads of their followers were sent as presents unto different cities how grievously they were hindered from that whereunto they were commanded each and every one of them fell prey to the hands of the enemies of his cause and had to suffer whatsoever they decreed it is evident that the changes brought about in every dispensation constitute the dark clouds that intervene between the eye of man’s understanding and the divine luminary which shineth forth from the dayspring of the divine essence consider how men for generations have been blindly imitating their fathers and have been trained according to such ways and manners as have been laid down by the dictates of their faith were these men therefore to discover suddenly that man who hath been living in their midst who with respect to every human limitation hath been their equal had risen to abolish every established principle imposed by their faith—principles by which for centuries they have been disciplined and every opposer and denier of which they have come to regard as infidel profligate and wicked—they would of certainty be veiled and hindered from acknowledging his truth such things are as “clouds” that veil the eyes of those whose inner being hath not tasted the salsabíl of detachment nor drunk from the kawthar of the knowledge of god such men when acquainted with these circumstances become so veiled that without the least question they pronounce the manifestation of god an infidel and sentence him to death you must have heard of such things taking place all down the ages and are now observing them in these days it behooveth us therefore to make the utmost endeavor that by god’s invisible assistance these dark veils these clouds of heaven sent trials may not hinder us from beholding the beauty of his shining countenance and that we may recognize him only by his own self and should we ask for testimony of his truth we should content ourselves with one and only one that thereby we may attain unto him who is the fountainhead of infinite grace and in whose presence all the world’s abundance fadeth into nothingness that we may cease to cavil at him every day and to cleave unto our own idle fancy gracious god notwithstanding the warning which in marvelously symbolic language and subtle allusions hath been uttered in days past and which was intended to awaken the peoples of the world and to prevent them from being deprived of their share of the billowing ocean of god’s grace yet such things as have already been witnessed have come to pass reference to these things hath also been made in the qur’án as witnessed by this verse “what can such expect but that god should come down to them overshadowed with clouds number of the divines who hold firmly to the letter of the word of god have come to regard this verse as one of the signs of that expected resurrection which is born of their idle fancy this notwithstanding the fact that similar references have been made in most of the heavenly books and have been recorded in all the passages connected with the signs of the coming manifestation likewise he saith “on the day when the heaven shall give out palpable smoke which shall enshroud mankind this will be an afflictive torment the all glorious hath decreed these very things that are contrary to the desires of wicked men to be the touchstone and standard whereby he proveth his servants that the just may be known from the wicked and the faithful distinguished from the infidel the symbolic term “smoke” denotes grave dissensions the abrogation and demolition of recognized standards and the utter destruction of their narrow minded exponents what smoke more dense and overpowering than the one which hath now enshrouded all the peoples of the world which hath become torment unto them and from which they hopelessly fail to deliver themselves however much they strive so fierce is this fire of self burning within them that at every moment they seem to be afflicted with fresh torments the more they are told that this wondrous cause of god this revelation from the most high hath been made manifest to all mankind and is waxing greater and stronger every day the fiercer groweth the blaze of the fire in their hearts the more they observe the indomitable strength the sublime renunciation the unwavering constancy of god’s holy companions who by the aid of god are growing nobler and more glorious every day the deeper the dismay which ravageth their souls in these days praise be to god the power of his word hath obtained such ascendancy over men that they dare breathe no word were they to encounter one of the companions of god who if he could would freely and joyously offer up ten thousand lives as sacrifice for his beloved so great would be their fear that they forthwith would profess their faith in him whilst privily they would vilify and execrate his name even as he hath revealed “and when they meet you they say ‘we believe’ but when they are apart they bite their fingers’ ends at you out of wrath say ‘die in your wrath god truly knoweth the very recesses of your breasts ere long thine eyes will behold the standards of divine power unfurled throughout all regions and the signs of his triumphant might and sovereignty manifest in every land as most of the divines have failed to apprehend the meaning of these verses and have not grasped the significance of the day of resurrection they therefore have foolishly interpreted these verses according to their idle and faulty conception the one true god is my witness little perception is required to enable them to gather from the symbolic language of these two verses all that we have purposed to propound and thus to attain through the grace of the all merciful the resplendent morn of certitude such are the strains of celestial melody which the immortal bird of heaven warbling upon the sadrih of bahá poureth out upon thee that by the permission of god thou mayest tread the path of divine knowledge and wisdom and now concerning his words “and he shall send his angels …” by “angels” is meant those who reinforced by the power of the spirit have consumed with the fire of the love of god all human traits and limitations and have clothed themselves with the attributes of the most exalted beings and of the cherubim that holy man ṣádiq in his eulogy of the cherubim saith “there stand company of our fellow shí‘ihs behind the throne divers and manifold are the interpretations of the words “behind the throne in one sense they indicate that no trueshí‘ihs exist even as he hath said in another passage “a true believer is likened unto the philosopher’s stone addressing subsequently his listener he saith “hast thou ever seen the philosopher’s stone reflect how this symbolic language more eloquent than any speech however direct testifieth to the nonexistence of true believer such is the testimony of ṣádiq and now consider how unfair and numerous are those who although they themselves have failed to inhale the fragrance of belief have condemned as infidels those by whose word belief itself is recognized and established and now inasmuch as these holy beings have sanctified themselves from every human limitation have become endowed with the attributes of the spiritual and have been adorned with the noble traits of the blessed they therefore have been designated as “angels such is the meaning of these verses every word of which hath been expounded by the aid of the most lucid texts the most convincing arguments and the best established evidences as the adherents of jesus have never understood the hidden meaning of these words and as the signs which they and the leaders of their faith have expected have failed to appear they therefore refused to acknowledge even until now the truth of those manifestations of holiness that have since the days of jesus been made manifest they have thus deprived themselves of the outpourings of god’s holy grace and of the wonders of his divine utterance such is their low estate in this the day of resurrection they have even failed to perceive that were the signs of the manifestation of god in every age to appear in the visible realm in accordance with the text of established traditions none could possibly deny or turn away nor would the blessed be distinguished from the miserable and the transgressor from the god fearing judge fairly were the prophecies recorded in the gospel to be literally fulfilled were jesus son of mary accompanied by angels to descend from the visible heaven upon the clouds who would dare to disbelieve who would dare to reject the truth and wax disdainful nay such consternation would immediately seize all the dwellers of the earth that no soul would feel able to utter word much less to reject or accept the truth it was owing to their misunderstanding of these truths that many christian divine hath objected to muḥammad and voiced his protest in such words “if thou art in truth the promised prophet why then art thou not accompanied by those angels our sacred books foretold and which must needs descend with the promised beauty to assist him in his revelation and act as warners unto his people even as the all glorious hath recorded their statement “why hath not an angel been sent down to him so that he should have been warner with him such objections and differences have persisted in every age and century the people have always busied themselves with such specious discourses vainly protesting “wherefore hath not this or that sign appeared such ills befell them only because they have clung to the ways of the divines of the age in which they lived and blindly imitated them in accepting or denying these essences of detachment these holy and divine beings these leaders owing to their immersion in selfish desires and their pursuit of transitory and sordid things have regarded these divine luminaries as being opposed to the standards of their knowledge and understanding and the opponents of their ways and judgments as they have literally interpreted the word of god and the sayings and traditions of the letters of unity and expounded them according to their own deficient understanding they have therefore deprived themselves and all their people of the bountiful showers of the grace and mercies of god and yet they bear witness to this well known tradition “verily our word is abstruse bewilderingly abstruse in another instance it is said “our cause is sorely trying highly perplexing none can bear it except favorite of heaven or an inspired prophet or he whose faith god hath tested these leaders of religion admit that none of these three specified conditions is applicable to them the first two conditions are manifestly beyond their reach as to the third it is evident that at no time have they been proof against those tests that have been sent by god and that when the divine touchstone appeared they have shown themselves to be naught but dross great god notwithstanding their acceptance of the truth of this tradition these divines who are still doubtful of and dispute about the theological obscurities of their faith yet claim to be the exponents of the subtleties of the law of god and the expounders of the essential mysteries of his holy word they confidently assert that such traditions as indicate the advent of the expected qá’im have not yet been fulfilled whilst they themselves have failed to inhale the fragrance of the meaning of these traditions and are still oblivious of the fact that all the signs foretold have come to pass that the way of god’s holy cause hath been revealed and the concourse of the faithful swift as lightning are even now passing upon that way whilst these foolish divines wait expecting to witness the signs foretold say ye foolish ones wait ye even as those before you are waiting were they to be questioned concerning those signs that must needs herald the revelation and rise of the sun of the muḥammadan dispensation to which we have already referred none of which have been literally fulfilled and were it to be said to them “wherefore have ye rejected the claims advanced by christians and the peoples of other faiths and regard them as infidels knowing not what answer to give they will reply “these books have been corrupted and are not and never have been of god reflect the words of the verses themselves eloquently testify to the truth that they are of god similar verse hath been also revealed in the qur’án were ye of them that comprehend verily say throughout all this period they have utterly failed to comprehend what is meant by corrupting the text yea in the writings and utterances of the mirrors reflecting the sun of the muḥammadan dispensation mention hath been made of “modification by the exalted beings” and “alteration by the disdainful such passages however refer only to particular cases among them is the story of ibn ṣúríyá when the people ofkhaybar asked the focal center of the muḥammadan revelation concerning the penalty of adultery committed between married man and married woman muḥammad answered and said “the law of god is death by stoning whereupon they protested saying “no such law hath been revealed in the pentateuch muḥammad answered and said “whom do ye regard among your rabbis as being recognized authority and having sure knowledge of the truth they agreed upon ibn súríyá thereupon muḥammad summoned him and said “i adjure thee by god who clove the sea for you caused manna to descend upon you and the cloud to overshadow you who delivered you from pharaoh and his people and exalted you above all human beings to tell us what moses hath decreed concerning adultery between married man and married woman he made reply “o muḥammad death by stoning is the law muḥammad observed “why is it then that this law is annulled and hath ceased to operate among the jews he answered and said “when nebuchadnezzar delivered jerusalem to the flames and put the jews to death only few survived the divines of that age considering the extremely limited number of the jews and the multitude of the amalekites took counsel together and came to the conclusion that were they to enforce the law of the pentateuch every survivor who hath been delivered from the hand of nebuchadnezzar would have to be put to death according to the verdict of the book owing to such considerations they totally repealed the penalty of death meanwhile gabriel inspired muḥammad’s illumined heart with these words “they pervert the text of the word of god this is one of the instances that have been referred to verily by “perverting” the text is not meant that which these foolish and abject souls have fancied even as some maintain that jewish and christian divines have effaced from the book such verses as extol and magnify the countenance of muḥammad and instead thereof have inserted the contrary how utterly vain and false are these words can man who believeth in book and deemeth it to be inspired by god mutilate it moreover the pentateuch had been spread over the surface of the earth and was not confined to mecca and medina so that they could privily corrupt and pervert its text nay rather by corruption of the text is meant that in which all muslim divines are engaged today that is the interpretation of god’s holy book in accordance with their idle imaginings and vain desires and as the jews in the time of muḥammad interpreted those verses of the pentateuch that referred to his manifestation after their own fancy and refused to be satisfied with his holy utterance the charge of “perverting” the text was therefore pronounced against them likewise it is clear how in this day the people of the qur’án have perverted the text of god’s holy book concerning the signs of the expected manifestation and interpreted it according to their inclination and desires in yet another instance he saith “a part of them heard the word of god and then after they had understood it distorted it and knew that they did so this verse too doth indicate that the meaning of the word of god hath been perverted not that the actual words have been effaced to the truth of this testify they that are sound of mind again in another instance he saith “woe unto those who with their own hands transcribe the book corruptly and then say ‘this is from god that they may sell it for some mean price this verse was revealed with reference to the divines and leaders of the jewish faith these divines in order to please the rich acquire worldly emoluments and give vent to their envy and misbelief wrote number of treatises refuting the claims of muḥammad supporting their arguments with such evidences as it would be improper to mention and claimed that these arguments were derived from the text of the pentateuch the same may be witnessed today consider how abundant are the denunciations written by the foolish divines of this age against this most wondrous cause how vain their imaginings that these calumnies are in conformity with the verses of god’s sacred book and in consonance with the utterances of men of discernment our purpose in relating these things is to warn you that were they to maintain that those verses wherein the signs referred to in the gospel are mentioned have been perverted were they to reject them and cling instead to other verses and traditions you should know that their words were utter falsehood and sheer calumny yea “corruption” of the text in the sense we have referred to hath been actually effected in particular instances few of these we have mentioned that it may become manifest to every discerning observer that unto few untutored holy men hath been given the mastery of human learning so that the malevolent opposer may cease to contend that certain verse doth indicate “corruption” of the text and insinuate that we through lack of knowledge have made mention of such things moreover most of the verses that indicate “corruption” of the text have been revealed with reference to the jewish people were ye to explore the isles of qur’ánic revelation we have also heard number of the foolish of the earth assert that the genuine text of the heavenly gospel doth not exist amongst the christians that it hath ascended unto heaven how grievously they have erred how oblivious of the fact that such statement imputeth the gravest injustice and tyranny to gracious and loving providence how could god when once the daystar of the beauty of jesus had disappeared from the sight of his people and ascended unto the fourth heaven cause his holy book his most great testimony amongst his creatures to disappear also what would be left to that people to cling to from the setting of the daystar of jesus until the rise of the sun of the muḥammadan dispensation what law could be their stay and guide how could such people be made the victims of the avenging wrath of god the omnipotent avenger how could they be afflicted with the scourge of chastisement by the heavenly king above all how could the flow of the grace of the all bountiful be stayed how could the ocean of his tender mercies be stilled we take refuge with god from that which his creatures have fancied about him exalted is he above their comprehension dear friend now when the light of god’s everlasting morn is breaking when the radiance of his holy words “god is the light of the heavens and of the earth” is shedding illumination upon all mankind when the inviolability of his tabernacle is being proclaimed by his sacred utterance “god hath willed to perfect his light” and the hand of omnipotence bearing his testimony “in his grasp he holdeth the kingdom of all things is being outstretched unto all the peoples and kindreds of the earth it behooveth us to gird up the loins of endeavor that haply by the grace and bounty of god we may enter the celestial city “verily we are god’s and abide within the exalted habitation “and unto him we do return it is incumbent upon thee by the permission of god to cleanse the eye of thine heart from the things of the world that thou mayest realize the infinitude of divine knowledge and mayest behold truth so clearly that thou wilt need no proof to demonstrate his reality nor any evidence to bear witness unto his testimony affectionate seeker shouldst thou soar in the holy realm of the spirit thou wouldst recognize god manifest and exalted above all things in such wise that thine eyes would behold none else but him “god was alone there was none else besides him so lofty is this station that no testimony can bear it witness neither evidence do justice to its truth wert thou to explore the sacred domain of truth thou wilt find that all things are known only by the light of his recognition that he hath ever been and will continue forever to be known through himself and if thou dwellest in the land of testimony content thyself with that which he himself hath revealed “is it not enough for them that we have sent down unto thee the book this is the testimony which he himself hath ordained greater proof than this there is none nor ever will be “this proof is his word his own self the testimony of his truth and now we beseech the people of the bayán all the learned the sages the divines and witnesses amongst them not to forget the wishes and admonitions revealed in their book let them at all times fix their gaze upon the essentials of his cause lest when he who is the quintessence of truth the inmost reality of all things the source of all light is made manifest they cling unto certain passages of the book and inflict upon him that which was inflicted in the dispensation of the qur’án for verily powerful is he the king of divine might to extinguish with one letter of his wondrous words the breath of life in the whole of the bayán and the people thereof and with one letter bestow upon them new and everlasting life and cause them to arise and speed out of the sepulchers of their vain and selfish desires take heed and be watchful and remember that all things have their consummation in belief in him in attainment unto his day and in the realization of his divine presence “there is no piety in turning your faces toward the east or toward the west but he is pious who believeth in god and the last day give ear people of the bayán unto the truth whereunto we have admonished you that haply ye may seek the shelter of the shadow extended in the day of god upon all mankind end of part one verily he who is the daystar of truth and revealer of the supreme being holdeth for all time undisputed sovereignty over all that is in heaven and on earth though no man be found on earth to obey him he verily is independent of all earthly dominion though he be utterly destitute thus we reveal unto thee the mysteries of the cause of god and bestow upon thee the gems of divine wisdom that haply thou mayest soar on the wings of renunciation to those heights that are veiled from the eyes of men thesignificance and essential purpose underlying these words is to reveal and demonstrate unto the pure in heart and the sanctified in spirit that they who are the luminaries of truth and the mirrors reflecting the light of divine unity in whatever age and cycle they are sent down from their invisible habitations of ancient glory unto this world to educate the souls of men and endue with grace all created things are invariably endowed with an all compelling power and invested with invincible sovereignty for these hidden gems these concealed and invisible treasures in themselves manifest and vindicate the reality of these holy words “verily god doeth whatsoever he willeth and ordaineth whatsoever he pleaseth to every discerning and illumined heart it is evident that god the unknowable essence the divine being is immensely exalted beyond every human attribute such as corporeal existence ascent and descent egress and regress far be it from his glory that human tongue should adequately recount his praise or that human heart comprehend his fathomless mystery he is and hath ever been veiled in the ancient eternity of his essence and will remain in his reality everlastingly hidden from the sight of men “no vision taketh in him but he taketh in all vision he is the subtile the all perceiving no tie of direct intercourse can possibly bind him to his creatures he standeth exalted beyond and above all separation and union all proximity and remoteness no sign can indicate his presence or his absence inasmuch as by word of his command all that are in heaven and on earth have come to exist and by his wish which is the primal will itself all have stepped out of utter nothingness into the realm of being the world of the visible gracious god how could there be conceived any existing relationship or possible connection between his word and they that are created of it the verse “god would have you beware of himself” unmistakably beareth witness to the reality of our argument and the words “god was alone there was none else besides him” are sure testimony of its truth all the prophets of god and their chosen ones all the divines the sages and the wise of every generation unanimously recognize their inability to attain unto the comprehension of that quintessence of all truth and confess their incapacity to grasp him who is the inmost reality of all things the door of the knowledge of the ancient of days being thus closed in the face of all beings the source of infinite grace according to his saying “his grace hath transcended all things my grace hath encompassed them all” hath caused those luminous gems of holiness to appear out of the realm of the spirit in the noble form of the human temple and be made manifest unto all men that they may impart unto the world the mysteries of the unchangeable being and tell of the subtleties of his imperishable essence these sanctified mirrors these daysprings of ancient glory are one and all the exponents on earth of him who is the central orb of the universe its essence and ultimate purpose from him proceed their knowledge and power from him is derived their sovereignty the beauty of their countenance is but reflection of his image and their revelation sign of his deathless glory they are the treasuries of divine knowledge and the repositories of celestial wisdom through them is transmitted grace that is infinite and by them is revealed the light that can never fade even as he hath said “there is no distinction whatsoever between thee and them except that they are thy servants and are created of thee this is the significance of the tradition “i am he himself and he is myself the traditions and sayings that bear direct reference to our theme are divers and manifold we have refrained from quoting them for the sake of brevity nay whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth is direct evidence of the revelation within it of the attributes and names of god inasmuch as within every atom are enshrined the signs that bear eloquent testimony to the revelation of that most great light methinks but for the potency of that revelation no being could ever exist how resplendent the luminaries of knowledge that shine in an atom and how vast the oceans of wisdom that surge within drop to supreme degree is this true of man who among all created things hath been invested with the robe of such gifts and hath been singled out for the glory of such distinction for in him are potentially revealed all the attributes and names of god to degree that no other created being hath excelled or surpassed all these names and attributes are applicable to him even as he hath said “man is my mystery and am his mystery manifold are the verses that have been repeatedly revealed in all the heavenly books and the holy scriptures expressive of this most subtle and lofty theme even as he hath revealed “we will surely show them our signs in the world and within themselves again he saith “and also in your own selves will ye not then behold the signs of god and yet again he revealeth “and be ye not like those who forget god and whom he hath therefore caused to forget their own selves in this connection he who is the eternal king—may the souls of all that dwell within the mystic tabernacle be sacrifice unto him—hath spoken “he hath known god who hath known himself swear by god esteemed and honored friend shouldst thou ponder these words in thine heart thou wilt of certainty find the doors of divine wisdom and infinite knowledge flung open before thy face from that which hath been said it becometh evident that all things in their inmost reality testify to the revelation of the names and attributes of god within them each according to its capacity indicateth and is expressive of the knowledge of god so potent and universal is this revelation that it hath encompassed all things visible and invisible thus hath he revealed “hath aught else save thee power of revelation which is not possessed by thee that it could have manifested thee blind is the eye which doth not perceive thee likewise hath the eternal king spoken “no thing have perceived except that perceived god within it god before it or god after it also in the tradition of kumayl it is written “behold light hath shone forth out of the morn of eternity and lo its waves have penetrated the inmost reality of all men man the noblest and most perfect of all created things excelleth them all in the intensity of this revelation and is fuller expression of its glory and of all men the most accomplished the most distinguished and the most excellent are the manifestations of the sun of truth nay all else besides these manifestations live by the operation of their will and move and have their being through the outpourings of their grace “but for thee would have not created the heavens nay all in their holy presence fade into utter nothingness and are thing forgotten human tongue can never befittingly sing their praise and human speech can never unfold their mystery these tabernacles of holiness these primal mirrors which reflect the light of unfading glory are but expressions of him who is the invisible of the invisibles by the revelation of these gems of divine virtue all the names and attributes of god such as knowledge and power sovereignty and dominion mercy and wisdom glory bounty and grace are made manifest these attributes of god are not and have never been vouchsafed specially unto certain prophets and withheld from others nay all the prophets of god his well favored his holy and chosen messengers are without exception the bearers of his names and the embodiments of his attributes they only differ in the intensity of their revelation and the comparative potency of their light even as he hath revealed “some of the apostles we have caused to excel the others it hath therefore become manifest and evident that within the tabernacles of these prophets and chosen ones of god the light of his infinite names and exalted attributes hath been reflected even though the light of some of these attributes may or may not be outwardly revealed from these luminous temples to the eyes of men that certain attribute of god hath not been outwardly manifested by these essences of detachment doth in no wise imply that they who are the daysprings of god’s attributes and the treasuries of his holy names did not actually possess it therefore these illuminated souls these beauteous countenances have each and every one of them been endowed with all the attributes of god such as sovereignty dominion and the like even though to outward seeming they be shorn of all earthly majesty to every discerning eye this is evident and manifest it requireth neither proof nor evidence yea inasmuch as the peoples of the world have failed to seek from the luminous and crystal springs of divine knowledge the inner meaning of god’s holy words they therefore have languished stricken and sore athirst in the vale of idle fancy and waywardness they have strayed far from the fresh and thirst subduing waters and gathered round the salt that burneth bitterly concerning them the dove of eternity hath spoken “and if they see the path of righteousness they will not take it for their path but if they see the path of error for their path will they take it this because they treated our signs as lies and were heedless of them to this testifieth that which hath been witnessed in this wondrous and exalted dispensation myriads of holy verses have descended from the heaven of might and grace yet no one hath turned thereunto nor ceased to cling to those words of men not one letter of which they that have spoken them comprehend for this reason the people have doubted incontestable truths such as these and caused themselves to be deprived of the riḍván of divine knowledge and the eternal meads of celestial wisdom and now to resume our argument concerning the question why is it that the sovereignty of the qá’im affirmed in the text of recorded traditions and handed down by the shining stars of the muḥammadan dispensation hath not in the least been made manifest nay the contrary hath come to pass have not his disciples and companions been afflicted of men are they not still the victims of the fierce opposition of their enemies are they not today leading the life of abased and impotent mortals yea the sovereignty attributed to the qá’im and spoken of in the scriptures is reality the truth of which none can doubt this sovereignty however is not the sovereignty which the minds of men have falsely imagined moreover the prophets of old each and every one whenever announcing to the people of their day the advent of the coming revelation have invariably and specifically referred to that sovereignty with which the promised manifestation must needs be invested this is attested by the records of the scriptures of the past this sovereignty hath not been solely and exclusively attributed to the qá’im nay rather the attribute of sovereignty and all other names and attributes of god have been and will ever be vouchsafed unto all the manifestations of god before and after him inasmuch as these manifestations as it hath already been explained are the embodiments of the attributes of god the invisible and the revealers of the divine mysteries furthermore by sovereignty is meant the all encompassing all pervading power which is inherently exercised by the qá’im whether or not he appear to the world clothed in the majesty of earthly dominion this is solely dependent upon the will and pleasure of the qá’im himself you will readily recognize that the terms sovereignty wealth life death judgment and resurrection spoken of by the scriptures of old are not what this generation hath conceived and vainly imagined nay by sovereignty is meant that sovereignty which in every dispensation resideth within and is exercised by the person of the manifestation the daystar of truth that sovereignty is the spiritual ascendancy which he exerciseth to the fullest degree over all that is in heaven and on earth and which in due time revealeth itself to the world in direct proportion to its capacity and spiritual receptiveness even as the sovereignty of muḥammad the messenger of god is today apparent and manifest amongst the people you are well aware of what befell his faith in the early days of his dispensation what woeful sufferings did the hand of the infidel and erring the divines of that age and their associates inflict upon that spiritual essence that most pure and holy being how abundant the thorns and briars which they have strewn over his path it is evident that wretched generation in their wicked and satanic fancy regarded every injury to that immortal being as means to the attainment of an abiding felicity inasmuch as the recognized divines of that age such as ‘abdu’lláh ubayy abú ‘ámir the hermit ka‘b ibn ashraf and naḍr ibn ḥárith all treated him as an impostor and pronounced him lunatic and calumniator such sore accusations they brought against him that in recounting them god forbiddeth the ink to flow our pen to move or the page to bear them these malicious imputations provoked the people to arise and torment him and how fierce that torment if the divines of the age be its chief instigators if they denounce him to their followers cast him out from their midst and declare him miscreant hath not the same befallen this servant and been witnessed by all for this reason did muḥammad cry out “no prophet of god hath suffered such harm as have suffered and in the qur’án are recorded all the calumnies and reproaches uttered against him as well as all the afflictions which he suffered refer ye thereunto that haply ye may be informed of that which hath befallen his revelation so grievous was his plight that for time all ceased to hold intercourse with him and his companions whoever associated with him fell victim to the relentless cruelty of his enemies we shall cite in this connection only one verse of that book shouldst thou observe it with discerning eye thou wilt all the remaining days of thy life lament and bewail the injury of muḥammad that wronged and oppressed messenger of god that verse was revealed at time when muḥammad languished weary and sorrowful beneath the weight of the opposition of the people and of their unceasing torture in the midst of his agony the voice of gabriel calling from the sadratu’l muntahá was heard saying “but if their opposition be grievous to thee—if thou canst seek out an opening into the earth or ladder into heaven the implication of this utterance is that his case had no remedy that they would not withhold their hands from him unless he should hide himself beneath the depths of the earth or take his flight unto heaven consider how great is the change today behold how many are the sovereigns who bow the knee before his name how numerous the nations and kingdoms who have sought the shelter of his shadow who bear allegiance to his faith and pride themselves therein from the pulpit top there ascendeth today the words of praise which in utter lowliness glorify his blessed name and from the heights of minarets there resoundeth the call that summoneth the concourse of his people to adore him even those kings of the earth who have refused to embrace his faith and to put off the garment of unbelief nonetheless confess and acknowledge the greatness and overpowering majesty of that daystar of loving kindness such is his earthly sovereignty the evidences of which thou dost on every side behold this sovereignty must needs be revealed and established either in the lifetime of every manifestation of god or after his ascension unto his true habitation in the realms above what thou dost witness today is but confirmation of this truth that spiritual ascendancy however which is primarily intended resideth within and revolveth around them from eternity even unto eternity it can never for moment be divorced from them its dominion hath encompassed all that is in heaven and on earth the following is an evidence of the sovereignty exercised by muḥammad the daystar of truth hast thou not heard how with one single verse he hath sundered light from darkness the righteous from the ungodly and the believing from the infidel all the signs and allusions concerning the day of judgment which thou hast heard such as the raising of the dead the day of reckoning the last judgment and others have been made manifest through the revelation of that verse these revealed words were blessing to the righteous who on hearing them exclaimed “o god our lord we have heard and obeyed they were curse to the people of iniquity who on hearing them affirmed “we have heard and rebelled those words sharp as the sword of god have separated the faithful from the infidel and severed father from son thou hast surely witnessed how they that have confessed their faith in him and they that rejected him have warred against each other and sought one another’s property how many fathers have turned away from their sons how many lovers have shunned their beloved so mercilessly trenchant was this wondrous sword of god that it cleft asunder every relationship on the other hand consider the welding power of his word observe how those in whose midst the satan of self had for years sown the seeds of malice and hate became so fused and blended through their allegiance to this wondrous and transcendent revelation that it seemed as if they had sprung from the same loins such is the binding force of the word of god which uniteth the hearts of them that have renounced all else but him who have believed in his signs and quaffed from the hand of glory the kawthar of god’s holy grace furthermore how numerous are those peoples of divers beliefs of conflicting creeds and opposing temperaments who through the reviving fragrance of the divine springtime breathing from the riḍván of god have been arrayed with the new robe of divine unity and have drunk from the cup of his singleness this is the significance of the well known words “the wolf and the lamb shall feed together behold the ignorance and folly of those who like the nations of old are still expecting to witness the time when these beasts will feed together in one pasture such is their low estate methinks never have their lips touched the cup of understanding neither have their feet trodden the path of justice besides of what profit would it be to the world were such thing to take place how well hath he spoken concerning them “hearts have they with which they understand not and eyes have they with which they see not consider how with this one verse which hath descended from the heaven of the will of god the world and all that is therein have been brought to reckoning with him whosoever acknowledged his truth and turned unto him his good works outweighed his misdeeds and all his sins were remitted and forgiven thereby is the truth of these words concerning him made manifest “swift is he in reckoning thus god turneth iniquity into righteousness were ye to explore the realms of divine knowledge and fathom the mysteries of his wisdom in like manner whosoever partook of the cup of love obtained his portion of the ocean of eternal grace and of the showers of everlasting mercy and entered into the life of faith—the heavenly and everlasting life but he that turned away from that cup was condemned to eternal death by the terms “life” and “death spoken of in the scriptures is intended the life of faith and the death of unbelief the generality of the people owing to their failure to grasp the meaning of these words rejected and despised the person of the manifestation deprived themselves of the light of his divine guidance and refused to follow the example of that immortal beauty when the light of qur’ánic revelation was kindled within the chamber of muḥammad’s holy heart he passed upon the people the verdict of the last day the verdict of resurrection of judgment of life and of death thereupon the standards of revolt were hoisted and the doors of derision opened thus hath he the spirit of god recorded as spoken by the infidels “and if thou shouldst say ‘after death ye shall surely be raised again the infidels will certainly exclaim ‘this is nothing but manifest sorcery ’” again he speaketh “if ever thou dost marvel marvelous surely is their saying ‘what when we have become dust shall we be restored in new creation ’” thus in another passage he wrathfully exclaimeth “are we wearied out with the first creation yet are they in doubt with regard to new creation as the commentators of the qur’án and they that follow the letter thereof misapprehended the inner meaning of the words of god and failed to grasp their essential purpose they sought to demonstrate that according to the rules of grammar whenever the term “idhá” meaning “if” or “when” precedeth the past tense it invariably hath reference to the future later they were sore perplexed in attempting to explain those verses of the book wherein that term did not actually occur even as he hath revealed “and there was blast on the trumpet—lo it is the threatened day and every soul is summoned to reckoning—with him an impeller and witness in explaining this and similar verses they have in some cases argued that the term “idhá” is implied in other instances they have idly contended that whereas the day of judgment is inevitable it hath therefore been referred to as an event not of the future but of the past how vain their sophistry how grievous their blindness they refuse to recognize the trumpet blast which so explicitly in this text was sounded through the revelation of muḥammad they deprive themselves of the regenerating spirit of god that breathed into it and foolishly expect to hear the trumpet sound of the seraph of god who is but one of his servants hath not the seraph himself the angel of the judgment day and his like been ordained by muḥammad’s own utterance say what will ye give that which is for your good in exchange for that which is evil wretched is that which ye have falsely exchanged surely ye are people evil in grievous loss nay by “trumpet” is meant the trumpet call of muḥammad’s revelation which was sounded in the heart of the universe and by “resurrection” is meant his own rise to proclaim the cause of god he bade the erring and wayward arise and speed out of the sepulchers of their bodies arrayed them with the beauteous robe of faith and quickened them with the breath of new and wondrous life thus at the hour when muḥammad that divine beauty purposed to unveil one of the mysteries hidden in the symbolic terms “resurrection “judgment “paradise and “hell gabriel the voice of inspiration was heard saying “erelong will they wag their heads at thee and say ‘when shall this be say ‘perchance it is nigh ’” the implications of this verse alone suffice the peoples of the world were they to ponder it in their hearts gracious god how far have that people strayed from the way of god although the day of resurrection was ushered in through the revelation of muḥammad although his light and tokens had encompassed the earth and all that is therein yet that people derided him gave themselves up to those idols which the divines of that age in their vain and idle fancy had conceived and deprived themselves of the light of heavenly grace and of the showers of divine mercy yea the abject beetle can never scent the fragrance of holiness and the bat of darkness can never face the splendor of the sun such things have come to pass in the days of every manifestation of god even as jesus said “ye must be born again again he saith “except man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit the purport of these words is that whosoever in every dispensation is born of the spirit and is quickened by the breath of the manifestation of holiness he verily is of those that have attained unto “life” and “resurrection” and have entered into the “paradise” of the love of god and whosoever is not of them is condemned to “death” and “deprivation to the “fire” of unbelief and to the “wrath” of god in all the scriptures the books and chronicles the sentence of death of fire of blindness of want of understanding and hearing hath been pronounced against those whose lips have tasted not the ethereal cup of true knowledge and whose hearts have been deprived of the grace of the holy spirit in their day even as it hath been previously recorded “hearts have they with which they understand not in another passage of the gospel it is written “and it came to pass that on certain day the father of one of the disciples of jesus had died that disciple reporting the death of his father unto jesus asked for leave to go and bury him whereupon jesus that essence of detachment answered and said “let the dead bury their dead in like manner two of the people of kúfih went to ‘alí the commander of the faithful one owned house and wished to sell it the other was to be the purchaser they had agreed that this transaction should be effected and the contract be written with the knowledge of ‘alí he the exponent of the law of god addressing the scribe said “write thou ‘a dead man hath bought from another dead man house that house is bounded by four limits one extendeth toward the tomb the other to the vault of the grave the third to the ṣiráṭ the fourth to either paradise or hell ’” reflect had these two souls been quickened by the trumpet call of ‘alí had they risen from the grave of error by the power of his love the judgment of death would certainly not have been pronounced against them in every age and century the purpose of the prophets of god and their chosen ones hath been no other but to affirm the spiritual significance of the terms “life “resurrection and “judgment if one will ponder but for while this utterance of ‘alí in his heart one will surely discover all mysteries hidden in the terms “grave “tomb “ṣiráṭ “paradise” and “hell but oh how strange and pitiful behold all the people are imprisoned within the tomb of self and lie buried beneath the nethermost depths of worldly desire wert thou to attain to but dewdrop of the crystal waters of divine knowledge thou wouldst readily realize that true life is not the life of the flesh but the life of the spirit for the life of the flesh is common to both men and animals whereas the life of the spirit is possessed only by the pure in heart who have quaffed from the ocean of faith and partaken of the fruit of certitude this life knoweth no death and this existence is crowned by immortality even as it hath been said “he who is true believer liveth both in this world and in the world to come if by “life” be meant this earthly life it is evident that death must needs overtake it similarly the records of all the scriptures bear witness to this lofty truth and this most exalted word moreover this verse of the qur’án revealed concerning ḥamzih the “prince of martyrs and abú jahl is luminous evidence and sure testimony of the truth of our saying “shall the dead whom we have quickened and for whom we have ordained light whereby he may walk among men be like him whose likeness is in the darkness whence he will not come forth this verse descended from the heaven of the primal will at time when ḥamzih had already been invested with the sacred mantle of faith and abú jahl had waxed relentless in his opposition and unbelief from the wellspring of omnipotence and the source of eternal holiness there came the judgment that conferred everlasting life upon ḥamzih and condemned abú jahl to eternal damnation this was the signal that caused the fires of unbelief to glow with the hottest flame in the heart of the infidels and provoked them openly to repudiate his truth they loudly clamored “when did ḥamzih die when was he risen at what hour was such life conferred upon him as they understood not the significance of these noble sayings nor sought enlightenment from the recognized expounders of the faith that these might confer sprinkling of the kawthar of divine knowledge upon them therefore such fires of mischief were kindled amongst men thou dost witness today how notwithstanding the radiant splendor of the sun of divine knowledge all the people whether high or low have clung to the ways of those abject manifestations of the prince of darkness they continually appeal to them for aid in unraveling the intricacies of their faith and owing to lack of knowledge they make such replies as can in no wise damage their fame and fortune it is evident that these souls vile and miserable as the beetle itself have had no portion of the musk laden breeze of eternity and have never entered the riḍván of heavenly delight how therefore can they impart unto others the imperishable fragrance of holiness such is their way and such will it remain forever only those will attain to the knowledge of the word of god that have turned unto him and repudiated the manifestations of satan thus god hath reaffirmed the law of the day of his revelation and inscribed it with the pen of power upon the mystic tablet hidden beneath the veil of celestial glory wert thou to heed these words wert thou to ponder their outward and inner meaning in thy heart thou wouldst seize the significance of all the abstruse problems which in this day have become insuperable barriers between men and the knowledge of the day of judgment then wilt thou have no more questions to perplex thee we fain would hope that god willing thou wilt not return deprived and still athirst from the shores of the ocean of divine mercy nor come back destitute from the imperishable sanctuary of thy heart’s desire let it now be seen what thy search and endeavors will achieve to resume our purpose in setting forth these truths hath been to demonstrate the sovereignty of him who is the king of kings be fair is this sovereignty which through the utterance of one word hath manifested such pervading influence ascendancy and awful majesty is this sovereignty superior or is the worldly dominion of these kings of the earth who despite their solicitude for their subjects and their help of the poor are assured only of an outward and fleeting allegiance while in the hearts of men they inspire neither affection nor respect hath not that sovereignty through the potency of one word subdued quickened and revitalized the whole world what can the lowly dust compare with him who is the lord of lords what tongue dare utter the immensity of difference that lieth between them nay all comparison falleth short in attaining the hallowed sanctuary of his sovereignty were man to reflect he would surely perceive that even the servant of his threshold ruleth over all created things this hath already been witnessed and will in future be made manifest this is but one of the meanings of the spiritual sovereignty which we have set forth in accordance with the capacity and receptiveness of the people for he the mover of all beings that glorified countenance is the source of such potencies as neither this wronged one can reveal nor this unworthy people comprehend immensely exalted is he above men’s praise of his sovereignty glorified is he beyond that which they attribute unto him and now ponder this in thine heart were sovereignty to mean earthly sovereignty and worldly dominion were it to imply the subjection and external allegiance of all the peoples and kindreds of the earth—whereby his loved ones should be exalted and be made to live in peace and his enemies be abased and tormented—such form of sovereignty would not be true of god himself the source of all dominion whose majesty and power all things testify for dost thou not witness how the generality of mankind is under the sway of his enemies have they not all turned away from the path of his good pleasure have they not done that which he hath forbidden and left undone nay repudiated and opposed those things which he hath commanded have not his friends ever been the victims of the tyranny of his foes all these things are more obvious than even the splendor of the noontide sun know therefore questioning seeker that earthly sovereignty is of no worth nor will it ever be in the eyes of god and his chosen ones moreover if ascendancy and dominion be interpreted to mean earthly supremacy and temporal power how impossible will it be for thee to explain these verses “and verily our host shall conquer “fain would they put out god’s light with their mouths but god hath willed to perfect his light albeit the infidels abhor it “he is the dominant above all things similarly most of the qur’án testifieth to this truth were the idle contention of these foolish and despicable souls to be true they would have none other alternative than to reject all these holy utterances and heavenly allusions for no warrior could be found on earth more excellent and nearer to god than ḥusayn son of ‘alí so peerless and incomparable was he “there was none to equal or to match him in the world yet thou must have heard what befell him “god’s malison on the head of the people of tyranny were the verse “and verily our host shall conquer” to be literally interpreted it is evident that it would in no wise be applicable to the chosen ones of god and his hosts inasmuch as ḥusayn whose heroism was manifest as the sun crushed and subjugated quaffed at last the cup of martyrdom in karbilá the land of ṭaff similarly the sacred verse “fain would they put out god’s light with their mouths but god hath willed to perfect his light albeit the infidels abhor it were it to be literally interpreted it would never correspond with the truth for in every age the light of god hath to outward seeming been quenched by the peoples of the earth and the lamps of god extinguished by them how then could the ascendancy of the sovereignty of these lamps be explained what could the potency of god’s will to “perfect his light” signify as hath already been witnessed so great was the enmity of the infidels that none of these divine luminaries ever found place for shelter or tasted of the cup of tranquillity so heavily were they oppressed that the least of men inflicted upon these essences of being whatsoever he listed these sufferings have been observed and measured by the people how therefore can such people be capable of understanding and expounding these words of god these verses of everlasting glory but the purpose of these verses is not what they have imagined nay the terms “ascendancy “power and “authority” imply totally different station and meaning for instance consider the pervading power of those drops of the blood of ḥusayn which besprinkled the earth what ascendancy and influence hath the dust itself through the sacredness and potency of that blood exercised over the bodies and souls of men so much so that he who sought deliverance from his ills was healed by touching the dust of that holy ground and whosoever wishing to protect his property treasured with absolute faith and understanding little of that holy earth within his house safeguarded all his possessions these are the outward manifestations of its potency and were we to recount its hidden virtues they would assuredly say “he verily hath considered the dust to be the lord of lords and hath utterly forsaken the faith of god furthermore call to mind the shameful circumstances that have attended the martyrdom of ḥusayn reflect upon his loneliness how to outer seeming none could be found to aid him none to take up his body and bury it and yet behold how numerous in this day are those who from the uttermost corners of the earth don the garb of pilgrimage seeking the site of his martyrdom that there they may lay their heads upon the threshold of his shrine such is the ascendancy and power of god such is the glory of his dominion and majesty think not that because these things have come to pass after ḥusayn’s martyrdom therefore all this glory hath been of no profit unto him for that holy soul is immortal liveth the life of god and abideth within the retreats of celestial glory upon the sadrih of heavenly reunion these essences of being are the shining exemplars of sacrifice they have offered and will continue to offer up their lives their substance their souls their spirit their all in the path of the well beloved by them no station however exalted could be more dearly cherished for lovers have no desire but the good pleasure of their beloved and have no aim except reunion with him should we wish to impart unto thee glimmer of the mysteries of ḥusayn’s martyrdom and reveal unto thee the fruits thereof these pages could never suffice nor exhaust their meaning our hope is that god willing the breeze of mercy may blow and the divine springtime clothe the tree of being with the robe of new life so that we may discover the mysteries of divine wisdom and through his providence be made independent of the knowledge of all things we have as yet descried none but handful of souls destitute of all renown who have attained unto this station let the future disclose what the judgment of god will ordain and the tabernacle of his decree reveal in such wise we recount unto thee the wonders of the cause of god and pour out into thine ears the strains of heavenly melody that haply thou mayest attain unto the station of true knowledge and partake of the fruit thereof therefore know thou of certainty that these luminaries of heavenly majesty though their dwelling be in the dust yet their true habitation is the seat of glory in the realms above though bereft of all earthly possessions yet they soar in the realms of immeasurable riches and whilst sore tried in the grip of the enemy they are seated on the right hand of power and celestial dominion amidst the darkness of their abasement there shineth upon them the light of unfading glory and upon their helplessness are showered the tokens of an invincible sovereignty thus jesus son of mary whilst seated one day and speaking in the strain of the holy spirit uttered words such as these “o people my food is the grass of the field wherewith satisfy my hunger my bed is the dust my lamp in the night the light of the moon and my steed my own feet behold who on earth is richer than by the righteousness of god thousands of treasures circle round this poverty and myriad kingdoms of glory yearn for such abasement shouldst thou attain to drop of the ocean of the inner meaning of these words thou wouldst surely forsake the world and all that is therein and as the phoenix wouldst consume thyself in the flames of the undying fire in like manner it is related that on certain day one of the companions of ṣádiq complained of his poverty before him whereupon ṣádiq that immortal beauty made reply “verily thou art rich and hast drunk the draft of wealth that poverty stricken soul was perplexed at the words uttered by that luminous countenance and said “where are my riches who stand in need of single coin ṣádiq thereupon observed “dost thou not possess our love he replied “yea possess it thou scion of the prophet of god and ṣádiq asked him saying “exchangest thou this love for one thousand dinars he answered “nay never will exchange it though the world and all that is therein be given me then ṣádiq remarked “how can he who possesses such treasure be called poor this poverty and these riches this abasement and glory this dominion power and the like upon which the eyes and hearts of these vain and foolish souls are set—all these things fade into utter nothingness in that court even as he hath said “o men ye are but paupers in need of god but god is the rich the self sufficing by “riches” therefore is meant independence of all else but god and by “poverty” the lack of things that are of god similarly call thou to mind the day when the jews who had surrounded jesus son of mary were pressing him to confess his claim of being the messiah and prophet of god so that they might declare him an infidel and sentence him to death then they led him away he who was the daystar of the heaven of divine revelation unto pilate and caiaphas who was the leading divine of that age the chief priests were all assembled in the palace also multitude of people who had gathered to witness his sufferings to deride and injure him though they repeatedly questioned him hoping that he would confess his claim yet jesus held his peace and spake not finally an accursed of god arose and approaching jesus adjured him saying “didst thou not claim to be the divine messiah didst thou not say ‘i am the king of kings my word is the word of god and am the breaker of the sabbath day’ thereupon jesus lifted up his head and said “beholdest thou not the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and might these were his words and yet consider how to outward seeming he was devoid of all power except that inner power which was of god and which had encompassed all that is in heaven and on earth how can relate all that befell him after he spoke these words how shall describe their heinous behavior towards him they at last heaped on his blessed person such woes that he took his flight unto the fourth heaven it is also recorded in the gospel according to st luke that on certain day jesus passed by jew who was sick of the palsy and lay upon couch when the jew saw him he recognized him and cried out for his help jesus said unto him “arise from thy bed thy sins are forgiven thee certain of the jews standing by protested saying “who can forgive sins but god alone and immediately he perceived their thoughts jesus answering said unto them “whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy arise and take up thy bed and walk or to say thy sins are forgiven thee that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins this is the real sovereignty and such is the power of god’s chosen ones all these things which we have repeatedly mentioned and the details which we have cited from divers sources have no other purpose but to enable thee to grasp the meaning of the allusions in the utterances of the chosen ones of god lest certain of these utterances cause thy feet to falter and thy heart to be dismayed thus with steadfast steps we may tread the path of certitude that perchance the breeze that bloweth from the meads of the good pleasure of god may waft upon us the sweet savors of divine acceptance and cause us vanishing mortals that we are to attain unto the kingdom of everlasting glory then wilt thou comprehend the inner meaning of sovereignty and the like spoken of in the traditions and scriptures furthermore it is already evident and known unto thee that those things to which the jews and the christians have clung and the cavilings which they heaped upon the beauty of muḥammad the same have in this day been upheld by the people of the qur’án and been witnessed in their denunciations of the “point of the bayán”—may the souls of all that dwell within the kingdom of divine revelations be sacrifice unto him behold their folly they utter the selfsame words uttered by the jews of old and know it not how well and true are his words concerning them “leave them to entertain themselves with their cavilings “as thou livest muḥammad they are seized by the frenzy of their vain fancies when the unseen the eternal the divine essence caused the daystar of muḥammad to rise above the horizon of knowledge among the cavils which the jewish divines raised against him was that after moses no prophet should be sent of god yea mention hath been made in the scriptures of soul who must needs be made manifest and who will advance the faith and promote the interests of the people of moses so that the law of the mosaic dispensation may encompass the whole earth thus hath the king of eternal glory referred in his book to the words uttered by those wanderers in the vale of remoteness and error “‘the hand of god say the jews ‘is chained up chained up be their own hands and for that which they have said they were accursed nay outstretched are both his hands “the hand of god is above their hands although the commentators of the qur’án have related in divers manners the circumstances attending the revelation of this verse yet thou shouldst endeavor to apprehend the purpose thereof he saith how false is that which the jews have imagined how can the hand of him who is the king in truth who caused the countenance of moses to be made manifest and conferred upon him the robe of prophethood—how can the hand of such one be chained and fettered how can he be conceived as powerless to raise up yet another messenger after moses behold the absurdity of their saying how far it hath strayed from the path of knowledge and understanding observe how in this day also all these people have occupied themselves with such foolish absurdities for over thousand years they have been reciting this verse and unwittingly pronouncing their censure against the jews utterly unaware that they themselves openly and privily are voicing the sentiments and belief of the jewish people thou art surely aware of their idle contention that all revelation is ended that the portals of divine mercy are closed that from the daysprings of eternal holiness no sun shall rise again that the ocean of everlasting bounty is forever stilled and that out of the tabernacle of ancient glory the messengers of god have ceased to be made manifest such is the measure of the understanding of these small minded contemptible people these people have imagined that the flow of god’s all encompassing grace and plenteous mercies the cessation of which no mind can contemplate has been halted from every side they have risen and girded up the loins of tyranny and exerted the utmost endeavor to quench with the bitter waters of their vain fancy the flame of god’s burning bush oblivious that the globe of power shall within its own mighty stronghold protect the lamp of god the utter destitution into which this people have fallen doth surely suffice them inasmuch as they have been deprived of the recognition of the essential purpose and the knowledge of the mystery and substance of the cause of god for the highest and most excelling grace bestowed upon men is the grace of “attaining unto the presence of god” and of his recognition which has been promised unto all people this is the utmost degree of grace vouchsafed unto man by the all bountiful the ancient of days and the fullness of his absolute bounty upon his creatures of this grace and bounty none of this people hath partaken neither have they been honored with this most exalted distinction how numerous are those revealed verses which explicitly bear witness unto this most weighty truth and exalted theme and yet they have rejected it and after their own desire misconstrued its meaning even as he hath revealed “as for those who believe not in the signs of god or that they shall ever meet him these of my mercy shall despair and for them doth grievous chastisement await also he saith “they who bear in mind that they shall attain unto the presence of their lord and that unto him shall they return also in another instance he saith “they who held it as certain that they must meet god said ‘how oft by god’s will hath small host vanquished numerous host ’” in yet another instance he revealeth “let him then who hopeth to attain the presence of his lord work righteous work and also he saith “he ordereth all things he maketh his signs clear that ye may have firm faith in attaining the presence of your lord this people have repudiated all these verses that unmistakably testify to the reality of “attainment unto the divine presence no theme hath been more emphatically asserted in the holy scriptures notwithstanding they have deprived themselves of this lofty and most exalted rank this supreme and glorious station some have contended that by “attainment unto the divine presence” is meant the “revelation” of god in the day of resurrection should they assert that the “revelation” of god signifieth “universal revelation it is clear and evident that such revelation already existeth in all things the truth of this we have already established inasmuch as we have demonstrated that all things are the recipients and revealers of the splendors of that ideal king and that the signs of the revelation of that sun the source of all splendor exist and are manifest in the mirrors of beings nay were man to gaze with the eye of divine and spiritual discernment he will readily recognize that nothing whatsoever can exist without the revelation of the splendor of god the ideal king consider how all created things eloquently testify to the revelation of that inner light within them behold how within all things the portals of the riḍván of god are opened that seekers may attain the cities of understanding and wisdom and enter the gardens of knowledge and power within every garden they will behold the mystic bride of inner meaning enshrined within the chambers of utterance in the utmost grace and fullest adornment most of the verses of the qur’án indicate and bear witness to this spiritual theme the verse “neither is there aught which doth not celebrate his praise” is eloquent testimony thereto and “we noted all things and wrote them down faithful witness thereof now if by “attainment unto the presence of god” is meant attainment unto the knowledge of such revelation it is evident that all men have already attained unto the presence of the unchangeable countenance of that peerless king why then restrict such revelation to the day of resurrection and were they to maintain that by “divine presence” is meant the “specific revelation of god expressed by certain ṣúfís as the “most holy outpouring if this be in the essence itself it is evident that it hath been eternally in the divine knowledge assuming the truth of this hypothesis “attainment unto the divine presence” is in this sense obviously possible to no one inasmuch as this revelation is confined to the innermost essence unto which no man can attain “the way is barred and all seeking rejected the minds of the favorites of heaven however high they soar can never attain this station how much less the understanding of obscured and limited minds and were they to say that by “divine presence” is meant the “secondary revelation of god interpreted as the “holy outpouring this is admittedly applicable to the world of creation that is in the realm of the primal and original manifestation of god such revelation is confined to his prophets and chosen ones inasmuch as none mightier than they hath come to exist in the world of being this truth all recognize and bear witness thereto these prophets and chosen ones of god are the recipients and revealers of all the unchangeable attributes and names of god they are the mirrors that truly and faithfully reflect the light of god whatsoever is applicable to them is in reality applicable to god himself who is both the visible and the invisible the knowledge of him who is the origin of all things and attainment unto him are impossible save through knowledge of and attainment unto these luminous beings who proceed from the sun of truth by attaining therefore to the presence of these holy luminaries the “presence of god” himself is attained from their knowledge the knowledge of god is revealed and from the light of their countenance the splendor of the face of god is made manifest through the manifold attributes of these essences of detachment who are both the first and the last the seen and the hidden it is made evident that he who is the sun of truth is “the first and the last the seen and the hidden likewise the other lofty names and exalted attributes of god therefore whosoever and in whatever dispensation hath recognized and attained unto the presence of these glorious these resplendent and most excellent luminaries hath verily attained unto the “presence of god” himself and entered the city of eternal and immortal life attainment unto such presence is possible only in the day of resurrection which is the day of the rise of god himself through his all embracing revelation this is the meaning of the “day of resurrection spoken of in all the scriptures and announced unto all people reflect can more precious mightier and more glorious day than this be conceived so that man should willingly forego its grace and deprive himself of its bounties which like unto vernal showers are raining from the heaven of mercy upon all mankind having thus conclusively demonstrated that no day is greater than this day and no revelation more glorious than this revelation and having set forth all these weighty and infallible proofs which no understanding mind can question and no man of learning overlook how can man possibly through the idle contention of the people of doubt and fancy deprive himself of such bountiful grace have they not heard the well known tradition “when the qá’im riseth that day is the day of resurrection” in like manner the imáms those unquenchable lights of divine guidance have interpreted the verse “what can such expect but that god should come down to them overshadowed with clouds —a sign which they have unquestionably regarded as one of the features of the day of resurrection—as referring to the qá’im and his manifestation strive therefore my brother to grasp the meaning of “resurrection and cleanse thine ears from the idle sayings of these rejected people shouldst thou step into the realm of complete detachment thou wilt readily testify that no day is mightier than this day and that no resurrection more awful than this resurrection can ever be conceived one righteous work performed in this day equaleth all the virtuous acts which for myriads of centuries men have practiced—nay we ask forgiveness of god for such comparison for verily the reward which such deed deserveth is immensely beyond and above the estimate of men inasmuch as these undiscerning and wretched souls have failed to apprehend the true meaning of “resurrection” and of the “attainment unto the divine presence they therefore have remained utterly deprived of the grace thereof although the sole and fundamental purpose of all learning and the toil and labor thereof is attainment unto and the recognition of this station yet they are all immersed in the pursuit of their material studies they deny themselves every moment of leisure and utterly ignore him who is the essence of all learning and the one object of their quest methinks their lips have never touched the cup of divine knowledge nor do they seem to have attained even dewdrop of the showers of heavenly grace consider how can he that faileth in the day of god’s revelation to attain unto the grace of the “divine presence” and to recognize his manifestation be justly called learned though he may have spent aeons in the pursuit of knowledge and acquired all the limited and material learning of men it is surely evident that he can in no wise be regarded as possessed of true knowledge whereas the most unlettered of all men if he be honored with this supreme distinction he verily is accounted as one of those divinely learned men whose knowledge is of god for such man hath attained the acme of knowledge and hath reached the furthermost summit of learning this station is also one of the signs of the day of revelation even as it is said “the abased amongst you he shall exalt and they that are exalted he shall abase and likewise he hath revealed in the qur’án “and we desire to show favor to those who were brought low in the land and to make them spiritual leaders among men and to make of them our heirs it hath been witnessed in this day how many of the divines owing to their rejection of the truth have fallen into and abide within the uttermost depths of ignorance and whose names have been effaced from the scroll of the glorious and learned and how many of the ignorant who by reason of their acceptance of the faith have soared aloft and attained the high summit of knowledge and whose names have been inscribed by the pen of power upon the tablet of divine knowledge thus “what he pleaseth will god abrogate or confirm for with him is the source of revelation therefore it hath been said “to seek evidence when the proof hath been established is but an unseemly act and to be busied with the pursuit of knowledge when the object of all learning hath been attained is truly blameworthy say people of the earth behold this flamelike youth that speedeth across the limitless profound of the spirit heralding unto you the tidings “lo the lamp of god is shining and summoning you to heed his cause which though hidden beneath the veils of ancient splendor shineth in the land of ‘iráq above the dayspring of eternal holiness my friend were the bird of thy mind to explore the heavens of the revelation of the qur’án were it to contemplate the realm of divine knowledge unfolded therein thou wouldst assuredly find unnumbered doors of knowledge set open before thee thou wouldst certainly recognize that all these things which have in this day hindered this people from attaining the shores of the ocean of eternal grace the same things in the muḥammadan dispensation prevented the people of that age from recognizing that divine luminary and from testifying to his truth thou wilt also apprehend the mysteries of “return” and “revelation and wilt securely abide within the loftiest chambers of certitude and assurance and it came to pass that on certain day number of the opponents of that peerless beauty those that had strayed far from god’s imperishable sanctuary scornfully spoke these words unto muḥammad “verily god hath entered into covenant with us that we are not to credit an apostle until he present us sacrifice which fire out of heaven shall devour the purport of this verse is that god hath covenanted with them that they should not believe in any messenger unless he work the miracle of abel and cain that is offer sacrifice and the fire from heaven consume it even as they had heard it recounted in the story of abel which story is recorded in the scriptures to this muḥammad answering said “already have apostles before me come to you with sure testimonies and with that of which ye speak wherefore slew ye them tell me if ye are men of truth and now be fair how could those people living in the days of muḥammad have existed thousands of years before in the age of adam or other prophets why should muḥammad that essence of truthfulness have charged the people of his day with the murder of abel or other prophets thou hast none other alternative except to regard muḥammad as an impostor or fool—which god forbid —or to maintain that those people of wickedness were the selfsame people who in every age opposed and caviled at the prophets and messengers of god till they finally caused them all to suffer martyrdom ponder this in thine heart that the sweet gales of divine knowledge blowing from the meads of mercy may waft upon thee the fragrance of the beloved’s utterance and cause thy soul to attain the riḍván of understanding as the wayward of every age have failed to fathom the deeper import of these weighty and pregnant utterances and imagined the answer of the prophets of god to be irrelevant to the questions they asked them they therefore have attributed ignorance and folly to those essences of knowledge and understanding likewise muḥammad in another verse uttereth his protest against the people of that age he saith “although they had before prayed for victory over those who believed not yet when there came unto them he of whom they had knowledge they disbelieved in him the curse of god on the infidels reflect how this verse also implieth that the people living in the days of muḥammad were the same people who in the days of the prophets of old contended and fought in order to promote the faith and teach the cause of god and yet how could the generations living at the time of jesus and moses and those who lived in the days of muḥammad be regarded as being actually one and the same people moreover those whom they had formerly known were moses the revealer of the pentateuch and jesus the author of the gospel notwithstanding why did muḥammad say “when he of whom they had knowledge came unto them”—that is jesus or moses—“they disbelieved in him” was not muḥammad to outward seeming called by different name did he not come forth out of different city did he not speak different language and reveal different law how then can the truth of this verse be established and its meaning be made clear strive therefore to comprehend the meaning of “return” which hath been so explicitly revealed in the qur’án itself and which none hath as yet understood what sayest thou if thou sayest that muḥammad was the “return” of the prophets of old as is witnessed by this verse his companions must likewise be the “return” of the bygone companions even as the “return” of the former people is clearly attested by the text of the above mentioned verses and if thou deniest this thou hast surely repudiated the truth of the qur’án the surest testimony of god unto men in like manner endeavor to grasp the significance of “return “revelation and “resurrection as witnessed in the days of the manifestations of the divine essence that thou mayest behold with thine own eyes the “return” of the holy souls into sanctified and illumined bodies and mayest wash away the dust of ignorance and cleanse the darkened self with the waters of mercy flowing from the source of divine knowledge that perchance thou mayest through the power of god and the light of divine guidance distinguish the morn of everlasting splendor from the darksome night of error furthermore it is evident to thee that the bearers of the trust of god are made manifest unto the peoples of the earth as the exponents of new cause and the bearers of new message inasmuch as these birds of the celestial throne are all sent down from the heaven of the will of god and as they all arise to proclaim his irresistible faith they therefore are regarded as one soul and the same person for they all drink from the one cup of the love of god and all partake of the fruit of the same tree of oneness these manifestations of god have each twofold station one is the station of pure abstraction and essential unity in this respect if thou callest them all by one name and dost ascribe to them the same attribute thou hast not erred from the truth even as he hath revealed “no distinction do we make between any of his messengers for they one and all summon the people of the earth to acknowledge the unity of god and herald unto them the kawthar of an infinite grace and bounty they are all invested with the robe of prophethood and honored with the mantle of glory thus hath muḥammad the point of the qur’án revealed “i am all the prophets likewise he saith “i am the first adam noah moses and jesus similar statements have been made by ‘alí sayings such as this which indicate the essential unity of those exponents of oneness have also emanated from the channels of god’s immortal utterance and the treasuries of the gems of divine knowledge and have been recorded in the scriptures these countenances are the recipients of the divine command and the daysprings of his revelation this revelation is exalted above the veils of plurality and the exigencies of number thus he saith “our cause is but one inasmuch as the cause is one and the same the exponents thereof also must needs be one and the same likewise the imáms of the muḥammadan faith those lamps of certitude have said “muḥammad is our first muḥammad our last muḥammad our all it is clear and evident to thee that all the prophets are the temples of the cause of god who have appeared clothed in divers attire if thou wilt observe with discriminating eyes thou wilt behold them all abiding in the same tabernacle soaring in the same heaven seated upon the same throne uttering the same speech and proclaiming the same faith such is the unity of those essences of being those luminaries of infinite and immeasurable splendor wherefore should one of these manifestations of holiness proclaim saying “i am the return of all the prophets he verily speaketh the truth in like manner in every subsequent revelation the return of the former revelation is fact the truth of which is firmly established inasmuch as the return of the prophets of god as attested by verses and traditions hath been conclusively demonstrated the return of their chosen ones also is therefore definitely proven this return is too manifest in itself to require any evidence or proof for instance consider that among the prophets was noah when he was invested with the robe of prophethood and was moved by the spirit of god to arise and proclaim his cause whoever believed in him and acknowledged his faith was endowed with the grace of new life of him it could be truly said that he was reborn and revived inasmuch as previous to his belief in god and his acceptance of his manifestation he had set his affections on the things of the world such as attachment to earthly goods to wife children food drink and the like so much so that in the daytime and in the night season his one concern had been to amass riches and procure for himself the means of enjoyment and pleasure aside from these things before his partaking of the reviving waters of faith he had been so wedded to the traditions of his forefathers and so passionately devoted to the observance of their customs and laws that he would have preferred to suffer death rather than violate one letter of those superstitious forms and manners current amongst his people even as the people have cried “verily we found our fathers with faith and verily in their footsteps we follow these same people though wrapt in all these veils of limitation and despite the restraint of such observances as soon as they drank the immortal draft of faith from the cup of certitude at the hand of the manifestation of the all glorious were so transformed that they would renounce for his sake their kindred their substance their lives their beliefs yea all else save god so overpowering was their yearning for god so uplifting their transports of ecstatic delight that the world and all that is therein faded before their eyes into nothingness have not this people exemplified the mysteries of “rebirth” and “return” hath it not been witnessed that these same people ere they were endued with the new and wondrous grace of god sought through innumerable devices to ensure the protection of their lives against destruction would not thorn fill them with terror and the sight of fox put them to flight but once having been honored with god’s supreme distinction and having been vouchsafed his bountiful grace they would if they were able have freely offered up ten thousand lives in his path nay their blessed souls contemptuous of the cage of their bodies would yearn for deliverance single warrior of that host would face and fight multitude and yet how could they but for the transformation wrought in their lives be capable of manifesting such deeds which are contrary to the ways of men and incompatible with their worldly desires it is evident that nothing short of this mystic transformation could cause such spirit and behavior so utterly unlike their previous habits and manners to be made manifest in the world of being for their agitation was turned into peace their doubt into certitude their timidity into courage such is the potency of the divine elixir which swift as the twinkling of an eye transmuteth the souls of men for instance consider the substance of copper were it to be protected in its own mine from becoming solidified it would within the space of seventy years attain to the state of gold there are some however who maintain that copper itself is gold which by becoming solidified is in diseased condition and hath not therefore reached its own state be that as it may the real elixir will in one instant cause the substance of copper to attain the state of gold and will traverse the seventy year stages in single moment could this gold be called copper could it be claimed that it hath not attained the state of gold whilst the touchstone is at hand to assay it and distinguish it from copper likewise these souls through the potency of the divine elixir traverse in the twinkling of an eye the world of dust and advance into the realm of holiness and with one step cover the earth of limitations and reach the domain of the placeless it behooveth thee to exert thine utmost to attain unto this elixir which in one fleeting breath causeth the west of ignorance to reach the east of knowledge illuminateth the darkness of night with the resplendence of the morn guideth the wanderer in the wilderness of doubt to the wellspring of the divine presence and fount of certitude and conferreth upon mortal souls the honor of acceptance into the riḍván of immortality now could this gold be thought to be copper these people could likewise be thought to be the same as before they were endowed with faith brother behold how the inner mysteries of “rebirth of “return and of “resurrection” have each through these all sufficing these unanswerable and conclusive utterances been unveiled and unraveled before thine eyes god grant that through his gracious and invisible assistance thou mayest divest thy body and soul of the old garment and array thyself with the new and imperishable attire therefore those who in every subsequent dispensation preceded the rest of mankind in embracing the faith of god who quaffed the clear waters of knowledge at the hand of the divine beauty and attained the loftiest summits of faith and certitude these can be regarded in name in reality in deeds in words and in rank as the “return” of those who in former dispensation had achieved similar distinctions for whatsoever the people of former dispensation have manifested the same hath been shown by the people of this latter generation consider the rose whether it blossometh in the east or in the west it is nonetheless rose for what mattereth in this respect is not the outward shape and form of the rose but rather the smell and fragrance which it doth impart purge thy sight therefore from all earthly limitations that thou mayest behold them all as the bearers of one name the exponents of one cause the manifestations of one self and the revealers of one truth and that thou mayest apprehend the mystic “return” of the words of god as unfolded by these utterances reflect for while upon the behavior of the companions of the muḥammadan dispensation consider how through the reviving breath of muḥammad they were cleansed from the defilements of earthly vanities were delivered from selfish desires and were detached from all else but him behold how they preceded all the peoples of the earth in attaining unto his holy presence—the presence of god himself—how they renounced the world and all that is therein and sacrificed freely and joyously their lives at the feet of that manifestation of the all glorious and now observe the “return” of the selfsame determination the selfsame constancy and renunciation manifested by the companions of the point of the bayán thou hast witnessed how these companions have through the wonders of the grace of the lord of lords hoisted the standards of sublime renunciation upon the inaccessible heights of glory these lights have proceeded from but one source and these fruits are the fruits of one tree thou canst discern neither difference nor distinction among them all this is by the grace of god on whom he will he bestoweth his grace please god that we avoid the land of denial and advance into the ocean of acceptance so that we may perceive with an eye purged from all conflicting elements the worlds of unity and diversity of variation and oneness of limitation and detachment and wing our flight unto the highest and innermost sanctuary of the inner meaning of the word of god from these statements therefore it hath been made evident and manifest that should soul in the “end that knoweth no end” be made manifest and arise to proclaim and uphold cause which in “the beginning that hath no beginning” another soul had proclaimed and upheld it can be truly declared of him who is the last and of him who was the first that they are one and the same inasmuch as both are the exponents of one and the same cause for this reason hath the point of the bayán—may the life of all else but him be his sacrifice —likened the manifestations of god unto the sun which though it rise from the “beginning that hath no beginning” until the “end that knoweth no end is nonetheless the same sun now wert thou to say that this sun is the former sun thou speakest the truth and if thou sayest that this sun is the “return” of that sun thou also speakest the truth likewise from this statement it is made evident that the term “last” is applicable to the “first and the term “first” applicable to the “last” inasmuch as both the “first” and the “last” have risen to proclaim one and the same faith notwithstanding the obviousness of this theme in the eyes of those that have quaffed the wine of knowledge and certitude yet how many are those who through failure to understand its meaning have allowed the term “seal of the prophets” to obscure their understanding and deprive them of the grace of all his manifold bounties hath not muḥammad himself declared “i am all the prophets” hath he not said as we have already mentioned “i am adam noah moses and jesus” why should muḥammad that immortal beauty who hath said “i am the first adam” be incapable of saying also “i am the last adam” for even as he regarded himself to be the “first of the prophets”—that is adam—in like manner the “seal of the prophets” is also applicable unto that divine beauty it is admittedly obvious that being the “first of the prophets he likewise is their “seal the mystery of this theme hath in this dispensation been sore test unto all mankind behold how many are those who clinging unto these words have disbelieved him who is their true revealer what we ask could this people presume the terms “first” and “last”—when referring to god—glorified be his name —to mean if they maintain that these terms bear reference to this material universe how could it be possible when the visible order of things is still manifestly existing nay in this instance by “first” is meant no other than the “last” and by “last” no other than the “first even as in the “beginning that hath no beginnings” the term “last” is truly applicable unto him who is the educator of the visible and of the invisible in like manner are the terms “first” and “last” applicable unto his manifestations they are at the same time the exponents of both the “first” and the “last whilst established upon the seat of the “first they occupy the throne of the “last were discerning eye to be found it will readily perceive that the exponents of the “first” and the “last of the “manifest” and the “hidden of the “beginning” and the “seal” are none other than these holy beings these essences of detachment these divine souls and wert thou to soar in the holy realm of “god was alone there was none else besides him thou wilt find in that court all these names utterly non existent and completely forgotten then will thine eyes no longer be obscured by these veils these terms and allusions how ethereal and lofty is this station unto which even gabriel unshepherded can never attain and the bird of heaven unassisted can never reach and now strive thou to comprehend the meaning of this saying of ‘alí the commander of the faithful “piercing the veils of glory unaided among these “veils of glory” are the divines and doctors living in the days of the manifestation of god who because of their want of discernment and their love and eagerness for leadership have failed to submit to the cause of god nay have even refused to incline their ears unto the divine melody “they have thrust their fingers into their ears and the people also utterly ignoring god and taking them for their masters have placed themselves unreservedly under the authority of these pompous and hypocritical leaders for they have no sight no hearing no heart of their own to distinguish truth from falsehood notwithstanding the divinely inspired admonitions of all the prophets the saints and chosen ones of god enjoining the people to see with their own eyes and hear with their own ears they have disdainfully rejected their counsels and have blindly followed and will continue to follow the leaders of their faith should poor and obscure person destitute of the attire of men of learning address them saying “follow ye people the messengers of god they would greatly surprised at such statement reply “what meanest thou that all these divines all these exponents of learning with all their authority their pomp and pageantry have erred and failed to distinguish truth from falsehood dost thou and people like thyself pretend to have comprehended that which they have not understood if numbers and excellence of apparel be regarded as the criterions of learning and truth the peoples of bygone age whom those of today have never surpassed in numbers magnificence and power should certainly be accounted superior and worthier people it is clear and evident that whenever the manifestations of holiness were revealed the divines of their day have hindered the people from attaining unto the way of truth to this testify the records of all the scriptures and heavenly books not one prophet of god was made manifest who did not fall victim to the relentless hate to the denunciation denial and execration of the clerics of his day woe unto them for the iniquities their hands have formerly wrought woe unto them for that which they are now doing what veils of glory more grievous than these embodiments of error by the righteousness of god to pierce such veils is the mightiest of all acts and to rend them asunder the most meritorious of all deeds may god assist us and assist you concourse of the spirit that perchance ye may in the time of his manifestation be graciously aided to perform such deeds and may in his days attain unto the presence of god furthermore among the “veils of glory” are such terms as the “seal of the prophets” and the like the removal of which is supreme achievement in the sight of these baseborn and erring souls all by reason of these mysterious sayings these grievous “veils of glory have been hindered from beholding the light of truth have they not heard the melody of that bird of heaven uttering this mystery “a thousand fáṭimihs have espoused all of whom were the daughters of muḥammad son of ‘abdu’lláh the ‘seal of the prophets’” behold how many are the mysteries that lie as yet unraveled within the tabernacle of the knowledge of god and how numerous the gems of his wisdom that are still concealed in his inviolable treasuries shouldest thou ponder this in thine heart thou wouldst realize that his handiwork knoweth neither beginning nor end the domain of his decree is too vast for the tongue of mortals to describe or for the bird of the human mind to traverse and the dispensations of his providence are too mysterious for the mind of man to comprehend his creation no end hath overtaken and it hath ever existed from the “beginning that hath no beginning” and the manifestations of his beauty no beginning hath beheld and they will continue to the “end that knoweth no end ponder this utterance in thine heart and reflect how it is applicable unto all these holy souls likewise strive thou to comprehend the meaning of the melody of that eternal beauty ḥusayn son of ‘alí who addressing salmán spoke words such as these “i was with thousand adams the interval between each and the next adam was fifty thousand years and to each one of these declared the successorship conferred upon my father he then recounteth certain details until he saith “i have fought one thousand battles in the path of god the least and most insignificant of which was like the battle ofkhaybar in which battle my father fought and contended against the infidels endeavor now to apprehend from these two traditions the mysteries of “end “return and “creation without beginning or end my beloved immeasurably exalted is the celestial melody above the strivings of human ear to hear or mind to grasp its mystery how can the helpless ant step into the court of the all glorious and yet feeble souls through lack of understanding reject these abstruse utterances and question the truth of such traditions nay none can comprehend them save those that are possessed of an understanding heart say he is that end for whom no end in all the universe can be imagined and for whom no beginning in the world of creation can be conceived behold concourse of the earth the splendors of the end revealed in the manifestations of the beginning how strange these people with one hand cling to those verses of the qur’án and those traditions of the people of certitude which they have found to accord with their inclinations and interests and with the other reject those which are contrary to their selfish desires “believe ye then part of the book and deny part how could ye judge that which ye understand not even as the lord of being hath in his unerring book after speaking of the “seal” in his exalted utterance “muḥammad is the apostle of god and the seal of the prophets hath revealed unto all people the promise of “attainment unto the divine presence to this attainment to the presence of the immortal king testify the verses of the book some of which we have already mentioned the one true god is my witness nothing more exalted or more explicit than “attainment unto the divine presence” hath been revealed in the qur’án well is it with him that hath attained thereunto in the day wherein most of the people even as ye witness have turned away therefrom and yet through the mystery of the former verse they have turned away from the grace promised by the latter despite the fact that “attainment unto the divine presence” in the “day of resurrection” is explicitly stated in the book it hath been demonstrated and definitely established through clear evidences that by “resurrection” is meant the rise of the manifestation of god to proclaim his cause and by “attainment unto the divine presence” is meant attainment unto the presence of his beauty in the person of his manifestation for verily “no vision taketh in him but he taketh in all vision notwithstanding all these indubitable facts and lucid statements they have foolishly clung to the term “seal and remained utterly deprived of the recognition of him who is the revealer of both the seal and the beginning in the day of his presence “if god should chastise men for their perverse doings he would not leave upon the earth moving thing but to an appointed time doth he respite them but apart from all these things had this people attained unto drop of the crystal streams flowing from the words “god doeth whatsoever he willeth and ordaineth whatsoever he pleaseth they would not have raised any unseemly cavils such as these against the focal center of his revelation the cause of god all deeds and words are held within the grasp of his power “all things lie imprisoned within the hollow of his mighty hand all things are easy and possible unto him he accomplisheth whatsoever he willeth and doeth all that he desireth “whoso sayeth ‘why’ or ‘wherefore’ hath spoken blasphemy were these people to shake off the slumber of negligence and realize that which their hands have wrought they would surely perish and would of their own accord cast themselves into fire—their end and real abode have they not heard that which he hath revealed “he shall not be asked of his doings” in the light of these utterances how can man be so bold as to question him and busy himself with idle sayings gracious god so great is the folly and perversity of the people that they have turned their face toward their own thoughts and desires and have turned their back upon the knowledge and will of god—hallowed and glorified be his name be fair were these people to acknowledge the truth of these luminous words and holy allusions and recognize god as “him that doeth whatsoever he pleaseth how could they continue to cleave unto these glaring absurdities nay with all their soul they would accept and submit to whatsoever he saith swear by god but for the divine decree and the inscrutable dispensations of providence the earth itself would have utterly destroyed all this people “he will however respite them until the appointed time of known day twelve hundred and eighty years have passed since the dawn of the muḥammadan dispensation and with every break of day these blind and ignoble people have recited their qur’án and yet have failed to grasp one letter of that book again and again they read those verses which clearly testify to the reality of these holy themes and bear witness to the truth of the manifestations of eternal glory and still apprehend not their purpose they have even failed to realize all this time that in every age the reading of the scriptures and holy books is for no other purpose except to enable the reader to apprehend their meaning and unravel their innermost mysteries otherwise reading without understanding is of no abiding profit unto man and it came to pass that on certain day needy man came to visit this soul craving for the ocean of his knowledge while conversing with him mention was made concerning the signs of the day of judgment resurrection revival and reckoning he urged us to explain how in this wondrous dispensation the peoples of the world were brought to reckoning when none were made aware of it thereupon we imparted unto him according to the measure of his capacity and understanding certain truths of science and ancient wisdom we then asked him saying “hast thou not read the qur’án and art thou not aware of this blessed verse ‘on that day shall neither man nor spirit be asked of his sin’ dost thou not realize that by ‘asking’ is not meant asking by tongue or speech even as the verse itself doth indicate and prove for afterward it is said ‘by their countenance shall the sinners be known and they shall be seized by their forelocks and their feet ’” thus the peoples of the world are judged by their countenance by it their misbelief their faith and their iniquity are all made manifest even as it is evident in this day how the people of error are by their countenance known and distinguished from the followers of divine guidance were these people wholly for the sake of god and with no desire but his good pleasure to ponder the verses of the book in their heart they would of certainty find whatsoever they seek in its verses would they find revealed and manifest all the things be they great or small that have come to pass in this dispensation they would even recognize in them references unto the departure of the manifestations of the names and attributes of god from out their native land to the opposition and disdainful arrogance of government and people and to the dwelling and establishment of the universal manifestation in an appointed and specially designated land no man however can comprehend this except he who is possessed of an understanding heart we seal our theme with that which was formerly revealed unto muḥammad that the seal thereof may shed the fragrance of that holy musk which leadeth men unto the riḍván of unfading splendor he said and his word is the truth “and god calleth to the abode of peace and he guideth whom he will into the right way “for them is an abode of peace with their lord and he shall be their protector because of their works this he hath revealed that his grace may encompass the world praise be to god the lord of all being we have variously and repeatedly set forth the meaning of every theme that perchance every soul whether high or low may obtain according to his measure and capacity his share and portion thereof should he be unable to comprehend certain argument he may thus by referring unto another attain his purpose “that all sorts of men may know where to quench their thirst by god this bird of heaven now dwelling upon the dust can besides these melodies utter myriad songs and is able apart from these utterances to unfold innumerable mysteries every single note of its unpronounced utterances is immeasurably exalted above all that hath already been revealed and immensely glorified beyond that which hath streamed from this pen let the future disclose the hour when the brides of inner meaning will as decreed by the will of god hasten forth unveiled out of their mystic mansions and manifest themselves in the ancient realm of being nothing whatsoever is possible without his permission no power can endure save through his power and there is none other god but he his is the world of creation and his the cause of god all proclaim his revelation and all unfold the mysteries of his spirit we have already in the foregoing pages assigned two stations unto each of the luminaries arising from the daysprings of eternal holiness one of these stations the station of essential unity we have already explained “no distinction do we make between any of them the other is the station of distinction and pertaineth to the world of creation and to the limitations thereof in this respect each manifestation of god hath distinct individuality definitely prescribed mission predestined revelation and specially designated limitations each one of them is known by different name is characterized by special attribute fulfills definite mission and is entrusted with particular revelation even as he saith “some of the apostles we have caused to excel the others to some god hath spoken some he hath raised and exalted and to jesus son of mary we gave manifest signs and we strengthened him with the holy spirit it is because of this difference in their station and mission that the words and utterances flowing from these wellsprings of divine knowledge appear to diverge and differ otherwise in the eyes of them that are initiated into the mysteries of divine wisdom all their utterances are in reality but the expressions of one truth as most of the people have failed to appreciate those stations to which we have referred they therefore feel perplexed and dismayed at the varying utterances pronounced by manifestations that are essentially one and the same it hath ever been evident that all these divergences of utterance are attributable to differences of station thus viewed from the standpoint of their oneness and sublime detachment the attributes of godhead divinity supreme singleness and inmost essence have been and are applicable to those essences of being inasmuch as they all abide on the throne of divine revelation and are established upon the seat of divine concealment through their appearance the revelation of god is made manifest and by their countenance the beauty of god is revealed thus it is that the accents of god himself have been heard uttered by these manifestations of the divine being viewed in the light of their second station—the station of distinction differentiation temporal limitations characteristics and standards—they manifest absolute servitude utter destitution and complete self effacement even as he saith “i am the servant of god am but man like you from these incontrovertible and fully demonstrated statements strive thou to apprehend the meaning of the questions thou hast asked that thou mayest become steadfast in the faith of god and not be dismayed by the divergences in the utterances of his prophets and chosen ones were any of the all embracing manifestations of god to declare “i am god he verily speaketh the truth and no doubt attacheth thereto for it hath been repeatedly demonstrated that through their revelation their attributes and names the revelation of god his name and his attributes are made manifest in the world thus he hath revealed “those shafts were god’s not thine and also he saith “in truth they who plighted fealty unto thee really plighted that fealty unto god and were any of them to voice the utterance “i am the messenger of god he also speaketh the truth the indubitable truth even as he saith “muḥammad is not the father of any man among you but he is the messenger of god viewed in this light they are all but messengers of that ideal king that unchangeable essence and were they all to proclaim “i am the seal of the prophets they verily utter but the truth beyond the faintest shadow of doubt for they are all but one person one soul one spirit one being one revelation they are all the manifestation of the “beginning” and the “end the “first” and the “last the “seen” and “hidden”—all of which pertain to him who is the innermost spirit of spirits and eternal essence of essences and were they to say “we are the servants of god this also is manifest and indisputable fact for they have been made manifest in the uttermost state of servitude servitude the like of which no man can possibly attain thus in moments in which these essences of being were deeply immersed beneath the oceans of ancient and everlasting holiness or when they soared to the loftiest summits of divine mysteries they claimed their utterance to be the voice of divinity the call of god himself were the eye of discernment to be opened it would recognize that in this very state they have considered themselves utterly effaced and nonexistent in the face of him who is the all pervading the incorruptible methinks they have regarded themselves as utter nothingness and deemed their mention in that court an act of blasphemy for the slightest whispering of self within such court is an evidence of self assertion and independent existence in the eyes of them that have attained unto that court such suggestion is itself grievous transgression how much more grievous would it be were aught else to be mentioned in that presence were man’s heart his tongue his mind or his soul to be busied with anyone but the well beloved were his eyes to behold any countenance other than his beauty were his ear to be inclined to any melody but his voice and were his feet to tread any way but his way in this day the breeze of god is wafted and his spirit hath pervaded all things such is the outpouring of his grace that the pen is stilled and the tongue is speechless by virtue of this station they have claimed for themselves the voice of divinity and the like whilst by virtue of their station of messengership they have declared themselves the messengers of god in every instance they have voiced an utterance that would conform to the requirements of the occasion and have ascribed all these declarations to themselves declarations ranging from the realm of divine revelation to the realm of creation and from the domain of divinity even unto the domain of earthly existence thus it is that whatsoever be their utterance whether it pertain to the realm of divinity lordship prophethood messengership guardianship apostleship or servitude all is true beyond the shadow of doubt therefore these sayings which we have quoted in support of our argument must be attentively considered that the divergent utterances of the manifestations of the unseen and daysprings of holiness may cease to agitate the soul and perplex the mind those words uttered by the luminaries of truth must needs be pondered and should their significance be not grasped enlightenment should be sought from the trustees of the depositories of knowledge that these may expound their meaning and unravel their mystery for it behooveth no man to interpret the holy words according to his own imperfect understanding nor having found them to be contrary to his inclination and desires to reject and repudiate their truth for such today is the manner of the divines and doctors of the age who occupy the seats of knowledge and learning and who have named ignorance knowledge and called oppression justice were these to ask the light of truth concerning those images which their idle fancy hath carved and were they to find his answer inconsistent with their own conceptions and their own understanding of the book they would assuredly denounce him who is the mine and wellhead of all knowledge as the very negation of understanding such things have happened in every age for instance when muḥammad the lord of being was questioned concerning the new moons he as bidden by god made reply “they are periods appointed unto men thereupon they that heard him denounced him as an ignorant man likewise in the verse concerning the “spirit he saith “and they will ask thee of the spirit say ‘the spirit proceedeth at my lord’s command ’” as soon as muḥammad’s answer was given they all clamorously protested saying “lo an ignorant man who knoweth not what the spirit is calleth himself the revealer of divine knowledge and now behold the divines of the age who because of their being honored by his name and finding that their fathers have acknowledged his revelation have blindly submitted to his truth observe were this people today to receive such answers in reply to such questionings they would unhesitatingly reject and denounce them—nay they would again utter the selfsame cavils even as they have uttered them in this day all this notwithstanding the fact that these essences of being are immensely exalted above such fanciful images and are immeasurably glorified beyond all these vain sayings and above the comprehension of every understanding heart their so called learning when compared with that knowledge is utter falsehood and all their understanding naught but blatant error nay whatsoever proceedeth from these mines of divine wisdom and these treasuries of eternal knowledge is truth and naught else but the truth the saying “knowledge is one point which the foolish have multiplied” is proof of our argument and the tradition “knowledge is light which god sheddeth into the heart of whomsoever he willeth” confirmation of our statement inasmuch as they have not apprehended the meaning of knowledge and have called by that name those images fashioned by their own fancy and which have sprung from the embodiments of ignorance they therefore have inflicted upon the source of knowledge that which thou hast heard and witnessed for instance certain man reputed for his learning and attainments and accounting himself as one of the preeminent leaders of his people hath in his book denounced and vilified all the exponents of true learning this is made abundantly clear by his explicit statements as well as by his allusions throughout his book as we had frequently heard about him we purposed to read some of his works although we never felt disposed to peruse other peoples’ writings yet as some had questioned us concerning him we felt it necessary to refer to his books in order that we might answer our questioners with knowledge and understanding his works in the arabic tongue were however not available until one day certain man informed us that one of his compositions entitled irshádu’l ‘avám could be found in this city from this title we perceived the odor of conceit and vainglory inasmuch as he hath imagined himself learned man and regarded the rest of the people ignorant his worth was in fact made known by the very title he had chosen for his book it became evident that its author was following the path of self and desire and was lost in the wilderness of ignorance and folly methinks he had forgotten the well known tradition which sayeth “knowledge is all that is knowable and might and power all creation notwithstanding we sent for the book and kept it with us few days it was probably referred to twice the second time we accidentally came upon the story of the “mi‘ráj” of muḥammad of whom was spoken “but for thee would not have created the spheres we noticed that he had enumerated some twenty or more sciences the knowledge of which he considered to be essential for the comprehension of the mystery of the “mi‘ráj we gathered from his statements that unless man be deeply versed in them all he can never attain to proper understanding of this transcendent and exalted theme among the specified sciences were the science of metaphysical abstractions of alchemy and natural magic such vain and discarded learnings this man hath regarded as the prerequisites of the understanding of the sacred and abiding mysteries of divine knowledge gracious god such is the measure of his understanding and yet behold what cavils and calumnies he hath heaped upon those embodiments of god’s infinite knowledge how well and true is the saying “flingest thou thy calumnies unto the face of them whom the one true god hath made the trustees of the treasures of his seventh sphere not one understanding heart or mind not one among the wise and learned hath taken notice of these preposterous statements and yet how clear and evident it is to every discerning heart that this so called learning is and hath ever been rejected by him who is the one true god how can the knowledge of these sciences which are so contemptible in the eyes of the truly learned be regarded as essential to the apprehension of the mysteries of the “mi‘ráj whilst the lord of the “mi‘ráj” himself was never burdened with single letter of these limited and obscure learnings and never defiled his radiant heart with any of these fanciful illusions how truly hath he said “all human attainment moveth upon lame ass whilst truth riding upon the wind darteth across space by the righteousness of god whoso desireth to fathom the mystery of this “mi‘ráj and craveth drop from this ocean if the mirror of his heart be already obscured by the dust of these learnings he must needs cleanse and purify it ere the light of this mystery can be reflected therein in this day they that are submerged beneath the ocean of ancient knowledge and dwell within the ark of divine wisdom forbid the people such idle pursuits their shining breasts are praise be to god sanctified from every trace of such learning and are exalted above such grievous veils we have consumed this densest of all veils with the fire of the love of the beloved—the veil referred to in the saying “the most grievous of all veils is the veil of knowledge upon its ashes we have reared the tabernacle of divine knowledge we have praise be to god burned the “veils of glory” with the fire of the beauty of the best beloved we have driven from the human heart all else but him who is the desire of the world and glory therein we cleave to no knowledge but his knowledge and set our hearts on naught save the effulgent glories of his light we were surprised exceedingly when we observed that his one purpose was to make the people realize that all these learnings were possessed by him and yet swear by god that not one breath blowing from the meads of divine knowledge hath ever been wafted upon his soul nor hath he ever unraveled single mystery of ancient wisdom nay were the meaning of knowledge ever to be expounded unto him dismay would fill his heart and his whole being would shake to its foundation notwithstanding his base and senseless statements behold to what heights of extravagance his claims have reached gracious god how great is our amazement at the way the people have gathered around him and have borne allegiance to his person content with transient dust these people have turned their face unto it and cast behind their backs him who is the lord of lords satisfied with the croaking of the crow and enamored with the visage of the raven they have renounced the melody of the nightingale and the charm of the rose what unspeakable fallacies the perusal of this pretentious book hath revealed they are too unworthy for any pen to describe and too base for one moment’s attention should touchstone be found however it would instantly distinguish truth from falsehood light from darkness and sun from shadow among the sciences which this pretender hath professed is that of alchemy we cherish the hope that either king or man of preeminent power may call upon him to translate this science from the realm of fancy to the domain of fact and from the plane of mere pretension to that of actual achievement would that this unlearned and humble servant who never laid any pretension to such things nor even regarded them as the criterion of true knowledge might undertake the same task that thereby the truth might be known and distinguished from falsehood but of what avail all this generation could offer us were wounds from its darts and the only cup it proffered to our lips was the cup of its venom on our neck we still bear the scar of chains and upon our body are imprinted the evidences of an unyielding cruelty and as to this man’s attainments his ignorance understanding and belief behold what the book which embraceth all things hath revealed “verily the tree of zaqqúm shall be the food of the athím and then follow certain verses until he saith “taste this for thou forsooth art the mighty karím consider how clearly and explicitly he hath been described in god’s incorruptible book this man moreover feigning humility hath in his own book referred to himself as the “athím servant” “athím” in the book of god mighty among the common herd “karím” in name ponder the blessed verse so that the meaning of the words “there is neither thing green nor sere but it is noted in the unerring book” may be imprinted upon the tablet of thy heart notwithstanding multitude bear him allegiance they have rejected the moses of knowledge and justice and clung to the sámirí of ignorance they have turned away their eyes from the daystar of truth which shineth in the divine and everlasting heaven and have utterly ignored its splendor my brother divine mine only can yield the gems of divine knowledge and the fragrance of the mystic flower can be inhaled only in the ideal garden and the lilies of ancient wisdom can blossom nowhere except in the city of stainless heart “in rich soil its plants spring forth abundantly by permission of its lord and in that soil which is bad they spring forth but scantily inasmuch as it hath been clearly shown that only those who are initiated into the divine mysteries can comprehend the melodies uttered by the bird of heaven it is therefore incumbent upon every one to seek enlightenment from the illumined in heart and from the treasuries of divine mysteries regarding the intricacies of god’s faith and the abstruse allusions in the utterances of the daysprings of holiness thus will these mysteries be unraveled not by the aid of acquired learning but solely through the assistance of god and the outpourings of his grace “ask ye therefore of them that have the custody of the scriptures if ye know it not but my brother when true seeker determineth to take the step of search in the path leading to the knowledge of the ancient of days he must before all else cleanse and purify his heart which is the seat of the revelation of the inner mysteries of god from the obscuring dust of all acquired knowledge and the allusions of the embodiments of satanic fancy he must purge his breast which is the sanctuary of the abiding love of the beloved of every defilement and sanctify his soul from all that pertaineth to water and clay from all shadowy and ephemeral attachments he must so cleanse his heart that no remnant of either love or hate may linger therein lest that love blindly incline him to error or that hate repel him away from the truth even as thou dost witness in this day how most of the people because of such love and hate are bereft of the immortal face have strayed far from the embodiments of the divine mysteries and shepherdless are roaming through the wilderness of oblivion and error that seeker must at all times put his trust in god must renounce the peoples of the earth detach himself from the world of dust and cleave unto him who is the lord of lords he must never seek to exalt himself above anyone must wash away from the tablet of his heart every trace of pride and vainglory must cling unto patience and resignation observe silence and refrain from idle talk for the tongue is smoldering fire and excess of speech deadly poison material fire consumeth the body whereas the fire of the tongue devoureth both heart and soul the force of the former lasteth but for time whilst the effects of the latter endure century that seeker should also regard backbiting as grievous error and keep himself aloof from its dominion inasmuch as backbiting quencheth the light of the heart and extinguisheth the life of the soul he should be content with little and be freed from all inordinate desire he should treasure the companionship of those that have renounced the world and regard avoidance of boastful and worldly people precious benefit at the dawn of every day he should commune with god and with all his soul persevere in the quest of his beloved he should consume every wayward thought with the flame of his loving mention and with the swiftness of lightning pass by all else save him he should succor the dispossessed and never withhold his favor from the destitute he should show kindness to animals how much more unto his fellowman to him who is endowed with the power of utterance he should not hesitate to offer up his life for his beloved nor allow the censure of the people to turn him away from the truth he should not wish for others that which he doth not wish for himself nor promise that which he doth not fulfill with all his heart should the seeker avoid fellowship with evildoers and pray for the remission of their sins he should forgive the sinful and never despise his low estate for none knoweth what his own end shall be how often hath sinner at the hour of death attained to the essence of faith and quaffing the immortal draft hath taken his flight unto the celestial concourse and how often hath devout believer at the hour of his soul’s ascension been so changed as to fall into the nethermost fire our purpose in revealing these convincing and weighty utterances is to impress upon the seeker that he should regard all else beside god as transient and count all things save him who is the object of all adoration as utter nothingness these are among the attributes of the exalted and constitute the hallmark of the spiritually minded they have already been mentioned in connection with the requirements of the wayfarers that tread the path of positive knowledge when the detached wayfarer and sincere seeker hath fulfilled these essential conditions then and only then can he be called true seeker whensoever he hath fulfilled the conditions implied in the verse “whoso maketh efforts for us he shall enjoy the blessing conferred by the words “in our ways shall we assuredly guide him only when the lamp of search of earnest striving of longing desire of passionate devotion of fervid love of rapture and ecstasy is kindled within the seeker’s heart and the breeze of his loving kindness is wafted upon his soul will the darkness of error be dispelled the mists of doubts and misgivings be dissipated and the lights of knowledge and certitude envelop his being at that hour will the mystic herald bearing the joyful tidings of the spirit shine forth from the city of god resplendent as the morn and through the trumpet blast of knowledge will awaken the heart the soul and the spirit from the slumber of negligence then will the manifold favors and outpouring grace of the holy and everlasting spirit confer such new life upon the seeker that he will find himself endowed with new eye new ear new heart and new mind he will contemplate the manifest signs of the universe and will penetrate the hidden mysteries of the soul gazing with the eye of god he will perceive within every atom door that leadeth him to the stations of absolute certitude he will discover in all things the mysteries of divine revelation and the evidences of an everlasting manifestation swear by god were he that treadeth the path of guidance and seeketh to scale the heights of righteousness to attain unto this glorious and supreme station he would inhale at distance of thousand leagues the fragrance of god and would perceive the resplendent morn of divine guidance rising above the dayspring of all things each and every thing however small would be to him revelation leading him to his beloved the object of his quest so great shall be the discernment of this seeker that he will discriminate between truth and falsehood even as he doth distinguish the sun from shadow if in the uttermost corners of the east the sweet savors of god be wafted he will assuredly recognize and inhale their fragrance even though he be dwelling in the uttermost ends of the west he will likewise clearly distinguish all the signs of god—his wondrous utterances his great works and mighty deeds—from the doings words and ways of men even as the jeweler who knoweth the gem from the stone or the man who distinguisheth the spring from autumn and heat from cold when the channel of the human soul is cleansed of all worldly and impeding attachments it will unfailingly perceive the breath of the beloved across immeasurable distances and will led by its perfume attain and enter the city of certitude therein he will discern the wonders of his ancient wisdom and will perceive all the hidden teachings from the rustling leaves of the tree—which flourisheth in that city with both his inner and his outer ear he will hear from its dust the hymns of glory and praise ascending unto the lord of lords and with his inner eye will he discover the mysteries of “return” and “revival how unspeakably glorious are the signs the tokens the revelations and splendors which he who is the king of names and attributes hath destined for that city the attainment of this city quencheth thirst without water and kindleth the love of god without fire within every blade of grass are enshrined the mysteries of an inscrutable wisdom and upon every rosebush myriad nightingales pour out in blissful rapture their melody its wondrous tulips unfold the mystery of the undying fire in the burning bush and its sweet savors of holiness breathe the perfume of the messianic spirit it bestoweth wealth without gold and conferreth immortality without death in every leaf ineffable delights are treasured and within every chamber unnumbered mysteries lie hidden they that valiantly labor in quest of god will when once they have renounced all else but him be so attached and wedded to that city that moment’s separation from it would to them be unthinkable they will hearken unto infallible proofs from the hyacinth of that assembly and receive the surest testimonies from the beauty of its rose and the melody of its nightingale once in about thousand years shall this city be renewed and readorned wherefore my friend it behooveth us to exert the highest endeavor to attain unto that city and by the grace of god and his loving kindness rend asunder the “veils of glory” so that with inflexible steadfastness we may sacrifice our drooping souls in the path of the new beloved we should with tearful eyes fervently and repeatedly implore him to grant us the favor of that grace that city is none other than the word of god revealed in every age and dispensation in the days of moses it was the pentateuch in the days of jesus the gospel in the days of muḥammad the messenger of god the qur’án in this day the bayán and in the dispensation of him whom god will make manifest his own book—the book unto which all the books of former dispensations must needs be referred the book which standeth amongst them all transcendent and supreme in these cities spiritual sustenance is bountifully provided and incorruptible delights have been ordained the food they bestow is the bread of heaven and the spirit they impart is god’s imperishable blessing upon detached souls they bestow the gift of unity enrich the destitute and offer the cup of knowledge unto them who wander in the wilderness of ignorance all the guidance the blessings the learning the understanding the faith and certitude conferred upon all that is in heaven and on earth are hidden and treasured within these cities for instance the qur’án was an impregnable stronghold unto the people of muḥammad in his days whosoever entered therein was shielded from the devilish assaults the menacing darts the soul devouring doubts and blasphemous whisperings of the enemy upon him was also bestowed portion of the everlasting and goodly fruits—the fruits of wisdom from the divine tree to him was given to drink the incorruptible waters of the river of knowledge and to taste the wine of the mysteries of divine unity all the things that people required in connection with the revelation of muḥammad and his laws were to be found revealed and manifest in that riḍván of resplendent glory that book constitutes an abiding testimony to its people after muḥammad inasmuch as its decrees are indisputable and its promise unfailing all have been enjoined to follow the precepts of that book until “the year sixty” —the year of the advent of god’s wondrous manifestation that book is the book which unfailingly leadeth the seeker unto the riḍván of the divine presence and causeth him that hath forsaken his country and is treading the seeker’s path to enter the tabernacle of everlasting reunion its guidance can never err its testimony no other testimony can excel all other traditions all other books and records are bereft of such distinction inasmuch as both the traditions and they that have spoken them are confirmed and proven solely by the text of that book moreover the traditions themselves grievously differ and their obscurities are manifold muḥammad himself as the end of his mission drew nigh spoke these words “verily leave amongst you my twin weighty testimonies the book of god and my family although many traditions had been revealed by that source of prophethood and mine of divine guidance yet he mentioned only that book thereby appointing it as the mightiest instrument and surest testimony for the seekers guide for the people until the day of resurrection with unswerving vision with pure heart and sanctified spirit consider attentively what god hath established as the testimony of guidance for his people in his book which is recognized as authentic by both the high and lowly to this testimony we both as well as all the peoples of the world must cling that through its light we may know and distinguish between truth and falsehood guidance and error inasmuch as muḥammad hath confined his testimonies to his book and to his family and whereas the latter hath passed away there remaineth his book only as his one testimony amongst the people in the beginning of his book he saith “alif lám mím no doubt is there about this book it is guidance unto the god fearing in the disconnected letters of the qur’án the mysteries of the divine essence are enshrined and within their shells the pearls of his unity are treasured for lack of space we do not dwell upon them at this moment outwardly they signify muḥammad himself whom god addresseth saying “o muḥammad there is no doubt nor uncertainty about this book which hath been sent down from the heaven of divine unity in it is guidance unto them that fear god consider how he hath appointed and decreed this selfsame book the qur’án as guidance unto all that are in heaven and on earth he the divine being and unknowable essence hath himself testified that this book is beyond all doubt and uncertainty the guide of all mankind until the day of resurrection and now we ask is it fair for this people to view with doubt and misgiving this most weighty testimony the divine origin of which god hath proclaimed and pronounced to be the embodiment of truth is it fair for them to turn away from the thing which he hath appointed as the supreme instrument of guidance for attainment unto the loftiest summits of knowledge and to seek aught else but that book how can they allow men’s absurd and foolish sayings to sow the seeds of distrust in their minds how can they any longer idly contend that certain person hath spoken this or that way or that certain thing did not come to pass had there been anything conceivable besides the book of god which could prove more potent instrument and surer guide to mankind would he have failed to reveal it in that verse it is incumbent upon us not to depart from god’s irresistible injunction and fixed decree as revealed in the above mentioned verse we should acknowledge the holy and wondrous scriptures for failing to do this we have failed to acknowledge the truth of this blessed verse for it is evident that whoso hath failed to acknowledge the truth of the qur’án hath in reality failed to acknowledge the truth of the preceding scriptures this is but the manifest implication of the verse were we to expound its inner meanings and unfold its hidden mysteries eternity would never suffice to exhaust their import nor would the universe be capable of bearing them god verily testifieth to the truth of our saying in another passage he likewise saith “and if ye be in doubt as to that which we have sent down to our servant then produce súrah like it and summon your witnesses beside god if ye are men of truth behold how lofty is the station and how consummate the virtue of these verses which he hath declared to be his surest testimony his infallible proof the evidence of his all subduing power and revelation of the potency of his will he the divine king hath proclaimed the undisputed supremacy of the verses of his book over all things that testify to his truth for compared with all other proofs and tokens the divinely revealed verses shine as the sun whilst all others are as stars to the peoples of the world they are the abiding testimony the incontrovertible proof the shining light of the ideal king their excellence is unrivaled their virtue nothing can surpass they are the treasury of the divine pearls and the depository of the divine mysteries they constitute the indissoluble bond the firm cord the ‘urvatu’l vuthqá the inextinguishable light through them floweth the river of divine knowledge and gloweth the fire of his ancient and consummate wisdom this is the fire which in one and the same moment kindleth the flame of love in the breasts of the faithful and induceth the chill of heedlessness in the heart of the enemy friend it behooveth us not to waive the injunction of god but rather acquiesce and submit to that which he hath ordained as his divine testimony this verse is too weighty and pregnant an utterance for this afflicted soul to demonstrate and expound god speaketh the truth and leadeth the way he verily is supreme over all his people he is the mighty the beneficent likewise he saith “such are the verses of god with truth do we recite them to thee but in what revelation will they believe if they reject god and his verses if thou wilt grasp the implication of this verse thou wilt recognize the truth that no manifestation greater than the prophets of god hath ever been revealed and no testimony mightier than the testimony of their revealed verses hath ever appeared upon the earth nay this testimony no other testimony can ever excel except that which the lord thy god willeth in another passage he saith “woe to every lying sinner who heareth the verses of god recited to him and then as though he heard them not persisteth in proud disdain apprise him of painful punishment the implications of this verse alone suffice all that is in heaven and on earth were the people to ponder the verses of their lord for thou hearest how in this day the people disdainfully ignore the divinely revealed verses as though they were the meanest of all things and yet nothing greater than these verses hath ever appeared nor will ever be made manifest in the world say unto them “o heedless people ye repeat what your fathers in bygone age have said whatever fruits they have gathered from the tree of their faithlessness the same shall ye gather also ere long shall ye be gathered unto your fathers and with them shall ye dwell in hellish fire an ill abode the abode of the people of tyranny in yet another passage he saith “and when he becometh acquainted with any of our verses he turneth them to ridicule there is shameful punishment for them the people derisively observed saying “work thou another miracle and give us another sign one would say “make now part of the heaven to fall down upon us” and another “if this be the very truth from before thee rain down stones upon us from heaven even as the people of israel in the time of moses bartered away the bread of heaven for the sordid things of the earth these people likewise sought to exchange the divinely revealed verses for their foul their vile and idle desires in like manner thou beholdest in this day that although spiritual sustenance hath descended from the heaven of divine mercy and been showered from the clouds of his loving kindness and although the seas of life at the behest of the lord of all being are surging within the riḍván of the heart yet these people ravenous as the dogs have gathered around carrion and contented themselves with the stagnant waters of briny lake gracious god how strange the way of this people they clamor for guidance although the standards of him who guideth all things are already hoisted they cleave to the obscure intricacies of knowledge when he who is the object of all knowledge shineth as the sun they see the sun with their own eyes and yet question that brilliant orb as to the proof of its light they behold the vernal showers descending upon them and yet seek an evidence of that bounty the proof of the sun is the light thereof which shineth and envelopeth all things the evidence of the shower is the bounty thereof which reneweth and investeth the world with the mantle of life yea the blind can perceive naught from the sun except its heat and the arid soil hath no share of the showers of mercy “marvel not if in the qur’án the unbeliever perceiveth naught but the trace of letters for in the sun the blind findeth naught but heat in another passage he saith “and when our clear verses are recited to them their only argument is to say ‘bring back our fathers if ye speak the truth ’” behold what foolish evidences they sought from these embodiments of an all encompassing mercy they scoffed at the verses single letter of which is greater than the creation of heavens and earth and which quickeneth the dead of the valley of self and desire with the spirit of faith and clamored saying “cause our fathers to speed out of their sepulchers such was the perversity and pride of that people each one of these verses is unto all the peoples of the world an unfailing testimony and glorious proof of his truth each of them verily sufficeth all mankind wert thou to meditate upon the verses of god in the above mentioned verse itself pearls of mysteries lie hidden whatever be the ailment the remedy it offereth can never fail heed not the idle contention of those who maintain that the book and verses thereof can never be testimony unto the common people inasmuch as they neither grasp their meaning nor appreciate their value and yet the unfailing testimony of god to both the east and the west is none other than the qur’án were it beyond the comprehension of men how could it have been declared as universal testimony unto all people if their contention be true none would therefore be required nor would it be necessary for them to know god inasmuch as the knowledge of the divine being transcendeth the knowledge of his book and the common people would not possess the capacity to comprehend it such contention is utterly fallacious and inadmissible it is actuated solely by arrogance and pride its motive is to lead the people astray from the riḍván of divine good pleasure and to tighten the reins of their authority over the people and yet in the sight of god these common people are infinitely superior and exalted above their religious leaders who have turned away from the one true god the understanding of his words and the comprehension of the utterances of the birds of heaven are in no wise dependent upon human learning they depend solely upon purity of heart chastity of soul and freedom of spirit this is evidenced by those who today though without single letter of the accepted standards of learning are occupying the loftiest seats of knowledge and the garden of their hearts is adorned through the showers of divine grace with the roses of wisdom and the tulips of understanding well is it with the sincere in heart for their share of the light of mighty day and likewise he saith “as for those who believe not in the verses of god or that they shall ever meet him these of my mercy shall despair and these doth grievous chastisement await also “and they say ‘shall we then abandon our gods for crazed poet ’” the implication of this verse is manifest behold what they observed after the verses were revealed they called him poet scoffed at the verses of god and exclaimed saying “these words of his are but tales of the ancients by this they meant that those words which were spoken by the peoples of old muḥammad hath compiled and called them the word of god likewise in this day thou hast heard the people impute similar charges to this revelation saying “he hath compiled these words from the words of old” or “these words are spurious vain and haughty are their sayings low their estate and station after the denials and denunciations which they uttered and unto which we have referred they protested saying “no independent prophet according to our scriptures should arise after moses and jesus to abolish the law of divine revelation nay he that is to be made manifest must needs fulfill the law thereupon this verse indicative of all the divine themes and testifying to the truth that the flow of the grace of the all merciful can never cease was revealed “and joseph came to you aforetime with clear tokens but ye ceased not to doubt of the message with which he came to you until when he died ye said ‘god will by no means raise up messenger after him thus god misleadeth him who is the transgressor the doubter therefore understand from this verse and know of certainty that the people in every age clinging to verse of the book have uttered such vain and absurd sayings contending that no prophet should again be made manifest to the world even as the christian divines who holding fast to the verse of the gospel to which we have already referred have sought to explain that the law of the gospel shall at no time be annulled and that no independent prophet shall again be made manifest unless he confirmeth the law of the gospel most of the people have become afflicted with the same spiritual disease even as thou dost witness how the people of the qur’án like unto the people of old have allowed the words “seal of the prophets” to veil their eyes and yet they themselves testify to this verse “none knoweth the interpretation thereof but god and they that are well grounded in knowledge and when he who is well grounded in all knowledge he who is the mother the soul the secret and the essence thereof revealeth that which is the least contrary to their desire they bitterly oppose him and shamelessly deny him these thou hast already heard and witnessed such deeds and words have been solely instigated by leaders of religion they that worship no god but their own desire who bear allegiance to naught but gold who are wrapt in the densest veils of learning and who enmeshed by its obscurities are lost in the wilds of error even as the lord of being hath explicitly declared “what thinkest thou he who hath made god of his passions and whom god causeth to err through knowledge and whose ears and whose heart he hath sealed up and over whose sight he hath cast veil—who after his rejection by god shall guide such one will ye not then be warned although the outward meaning of “whom god causeth to err through knowledge” is what hath been revealed yet to us it signifieth those divines of the age who have turned away from the beauty of god and who clinging unto their own learning as fashioned by their own fancies and desires have denounced god’s divine message and revelation “say it is weighty message from which ye turn aside likewise he saith “and when our clear verses are recited to them they say ‘this is merely man who would fain pervert you from your father’s worship and they say ‘this is none other than forged falsehood ’” give ear unto god’s holy voice and heed thou his sweet and immortal melody behold how he hath solemnly warned them that have repudiated the verses of god and hath disowned them that have denied his holy words consider how far the people have strayed from the kawthar of the divine presence and how grievous hath been the faithlessness and arrogance of the spiritually destitute in the face of that sanctified beauty although that essence of loving kindness and bounty caused those evanescent beings to step into the realm of immortality and guided those destitute souls to the sacred river of wealth yet some denounced him as “a calumniator of god the lord of all creatures others accused him of being “the one that withholdeth the people from the path of faith and true belief and still others declared him to be “a lunatic” and the like in like manner thou observest in this day with what vile imputations they have assailed that gem of immortality and what unspeakable transgressions they have heaped upon him who is the source of purity although god hath throughout his book and in his holy and immortal tablet warned them that deny and repudiate the revealed verses and hath announced his grace unto them that accept them yet behold the unnumbered cavils they raised against those verses which have been sent down from the new heaven of god’s eternal holiness this notwithstanding the fact that no eye hath beheld so great an outpouring of bounty nor hath any ear heard of such revelation of loving kindness such bounty and revelation have been made manifest that the revealed verses seemed as vernal showers raining from the clouds of the mercy of the all bountiful the prophets “endowed with constancy whose loftiness and glory shine as the sun were each honored with book which all have seen and the verses of which have been duly ascertained whereas the verses which have rained from this cloud of divine mercy have been so abundant that none hath yet been able to estimate their number score of volumes are now available how many still remain beyond our reach how many have been plundered and have fallen into the hands of the enemy the fate of which none knoweth brother we should open our eyes meditate upon his word and seek the sheltering shadow of the manifestations of god that perchance we may be warned by the unmistakable counsels of the book and give heed to the admonitions recorded in the holy tablets that we may not cavil at the revealer of the verses that we may resign ourselves wholly to his cause and embrace wholeheartedly his law that haply we may enter the court of his mercy and dwell upon the shore of his grace he verily is merciful and forgiving towards his servants and likewise he saith “say people of the book do ye not disavow us only because we believe in god and in what he hath sent down to us and in what he hath sent down aforetime and because most of you are doers of ill how explicitly doth this verse reveal our purpose and how clearly doth it demonstrate the truth of the testimony of the verses of god this verse was revealed at time when islám was assailed by the infidels and its followers were accused of misbelief when the companions of muḥammad were denounced as repudiators of god and as followers of lying sorcerer in its early days when islám was still to outward seeming devoid of authority and power the friends of the prophet who had turned their face toward god wherever they went were harassed persecuted stoned and vilified at such time this blessed verse was sent down from the heaven of divine revelation it revealed an irrefutable evidence and brought the light of an unfailing guidance it instructed the companions of muḥammad to declare the following unto the infidels and idolaters “ye oppress and persecute us and yet what else have we done except that we have believed in god and in the verses sent down unto us through the tongue of muḥammad and in those which descended upon the prophets of old by this is meant that their only guilt was to have recognized that the new and wondrous verses of god which had descended upon muḥammad as well as those which had been revealed unto the prophets of old were all of god and to have acknowledged and embraced their truth this is the testimony which the divine king hath taught his servants in view of this is it fair for this people to repudiate these newly revealed verses which have encompassed both the east and the west and to regard themselves as the upholders of true belief should they not rather believe in him who hath revealed these verses considering the testimony which he himself hath established how could he fail to account as true believers them that have testified to its truth far be it from him that he should turn away from the gates of his mercy them that have turned unto and embraced the truth of the divine verses or that he should threaten those that have clung to his sure testimony he verily establisheth the truth through his verses and confirmeth his revelation by his words he verily is the powerful the help in peril the almighty and likewise he saith “and had we sent down unto thee book written on parchment and they had touched it with their hands the infidels would surely have said ‘this is naught but palpable sorcery ’” most of the verses of the qur’án are indicative of this theme we have for the sake of brevity mentioned only these verses consider hath anything else besides the verses been established in the whole book as standard for the recognition of the manifestations of his beauty that the people might cling to and reject the manifestations of god on the contrary in every instance he hath threatened with fire those that repudiate and scoff at the verses as already shown therefore should person arise and bring forth myriad verses discourses epistles and prayers none of which have been acquired through learning what conceivable excuse could justify those that reject them and deprive themselves of the potency of their grace what answer could they give when once their soul hath ascended and departed from its gloomy temple could they seek to justify themselves by saying “we have clung to certain tradition and not having beheld the literal fulfillment thereof we have therefore raised such cavils against the embodiments of divine revelation and kept remote from the law of god” hast thou not heard that among the reasons why certain prophets have been designated as prophets “endowed with constancy” was the revelation of book unto them and yet how could this people be justified in rejecting the revealer and author of so many volumes of verses and follow the sayings of him who hath foolishly sown the seeds of doubt in the hearts of men and who satan like hath risen to lead the people into the paths of perdition and error how could they allow such things to deprive them of the light of the sun of divine bounty aside from these things if these people shun and reject such divine soul such holy breath to whom we wonder could they cling to whose face besides his face could they turn yea—“all have quarter of the heavens to which they turn we have shown thee these two ways walk thou the way thou choosest this verily is the truth and after truth there remaineth naught but error amongst the proofs demonstrating the truth of this revelation is this that in every age and dispensation whenever the invisible essence was revealed in the person of his manifestation certain souls obscure and detached from all worldly entanglements would seek illumination from the sun of prophethood and moon of divine guidance and would attain unto the divine presence for this reason the divines of the age and those possessed of wealth would scorn and scoff at these people even as he hath revealed concerning them that erred “then said the chiefs of his people who believed not ‘we see in thee but man like ourselves and we see not any who have followed thee except our meanest ones of hasty judgment nor see we any excellence in you above ourselves nay we deem you liars ’” they caviled at those holy manifestations and protested saying “none hath followed you except the abject amongst us those who are worthy of no attention their aim was to show that no one amongst the learned the wealthy and the renowned believed in them by this and similar proofs they sought to demonstrate the falsity of him that speaketh naught but the truth in this most resplendent dispensation however this most mighty sovereignty number of illumined divines of men of consummate learning of doctors of mature wisdom have attained unto his court drunk the cup of his divine presence and been invested with the honor of his most excellent favor they have renounced for the sake of the beloved the world and all that is therein we will mention the names of some of them that perchance it may strengthen the fainthearted and encourage the timorous among them was mullá ḥusayn who became the recipient of the effulgent glory of the sun of divine revelation but for him god would not have been established upon the seat of his mercy nor ascended the throne of eternal glory among them also was siyyid yaḥyá that unique and peerless figure of his age mullá muḥammad ‘alíy zanjánímullá ‘alíy bastámímullá sa‘íd bárfurúshímullá ni‘matu’lláh mázindaránímullá yúsuf ardibílímullá mihdíy khu’ísiyyid ḥusayn turshízímullá mihdíy kandímullá báqirmullá ‘abdu’l kháliq yazdímullá ‘alíy baraqáníand others well nigh four hundred in number whose names are all inscribed upon the “guarded tablet” of god all these were guided by the light of that sun of divine revelation confessed and acknowledged his truth such was their faith that most of them renounced their substance and kindred and cleaved to the good pleasure of the all glorious they laid down their lives for their well beloved and surrendered their all in his path their breasts were made targets for the darts of the enemy and their heads adorned the spears of the infidel no land remained which did not drink the blood of these embodiments of detachment and no sword that did not bruise their necks their deeds alone testify to the truth of their words doth not the testimony of these holy souls who have so gloriously risen to offer up their lives for their beloved that the whole world marveled at the manner of their sacrifice suffice the people of this day is it not sufficient witness against the faithlessness of those who for trifle betrayed their faith who bartered away immortality for that which perisheth who gave up the kawthar of the divine presence for salty springs and whose one aim in life is to usurp the property of others even as thou dost witness how all of them have busied themselves with the vanities of the world and have strayed far from him who is the lord the most high be fair is the testimony of those acceptable and worthy of attention whose deeds agree with their words whose outward behavior conforms with their inner life the mind is bewildered at their deeds and the soul marveleth at their fortitude and bodily endurance or is the testimony of these faithless souls who breathe naught but the breath of selfish desire and who lie imprisoned in the cage of their idle fancies acceptable like the bats of darkness they lift not their heads from their couch except to pursue the transient things of the world and find no rest by night except as they labor to advance the aims of their sordid life immersed in their selfish schemes they are oblivious of the divine decree in the daytime they strive with all their soul after worldly benefits and in the night season their sole occupation is to gratify their carnal desires by what law or standard could men be justified in cleaving to the denials of such petty minded souls and in ignoring the faith of them that have renounced for the sake of the good pleasure of god their life and substance their fame and renown their reputation and honor were not the happenings of the life of the “prince of martyrs” regarded as the greatest of all events as the supreme evidence of his truth did not the people of old declare those happenings to be unprecedented did they not maintain that no manifestation of truth hath ever evinced such constancy such conspicuous glory and yet that episode of his life commencing as it did in the morning was brought to close by the middle of the same day whereas these holy lights have for eighteen years heroically endured the showers of afflictions which from every side have rained upon them with what love what devotion what exultation and holy rapture they sacrificed their lives in the path of the all glorious to the truth of this all witness and yet how can they belittle this revelation hath any age witnessed such momentous happenings if these companions be not the true strivers after god who else could be called by this name have these companions been seekers after power or glory have they ever yearned for riches have they cherished any desire except the good pleasure of god if these companions with all their marvelous testimonies and wondrous works be false who then is worthy to claim for himself the truth swear by god their very deeds are sufficient testimony and an irrefutable proof unto all the peoples of the earth were men to ponder in their hearts the mysteries of divine revelation “and they who act unjustly shall soon know what lot awaiteth them furthermore the sign of truth and falsehood is designated and appointed in the book by this divinely appointed touchstone the claims and pretensions of all men must needs be assayed so that the truthful may be known and distinguished from the imposter this touchstone is no other than this verse “wish for death if ye are men of truth consider these martyrs of unquestionable sincerity to whose truthfulness testifieth the explicit text of the book and all of whom as thou hast witnessed have sacrificed their life their substance their wives their children their all and ascended unto the loftiest chambers of paradise is it fair to reject the testimony of these detached and exalted beings to the truth of this preeminent and glorious revelation and to regard as acceptable the denunciations which have been uttered against this resplendent light by this faithless people who for gold have forsaken their faith and who for the sake of leadership have repudiated him who is the first leader of all mankind this although their character is now revealed unto all people who have recognized them as those who will in no wise relinquish one jot or one tittle of their temporal authority for the sake of god’s holy faith how much less their life their substance and the like behold how the divine touchstone hath according to the explicit text of the book separated and distinguished the true from the false notwithstanding they are still oblivious of this truth and in the sleep of heedlessness are pursuing the vanities of the world and are occupied with thoughts of vain and earthly leadership “o son of man many day hath passed over thee whilst thou hast busied thyself with thy fancies and idle imaginings how long art thou to slumber on thy bed lift up thine head from slumber for the sun hath risen to the zenith haply it may shine upon thee with the light of beauty let it be known however that none of these doctors and divines to whom we have referred was invested with the rank and dignity of leadership for well known and influential leaders of religion who occupy the seats of authority and exercise the functions of leadership can in no wise bear allegiance to the revealer of truth except whomsoever thy lord willeth but for few such things have never come to pass “and few of my servants are the thankful even as in this dispensation not one amongst the renowned divines in the grasp of whose authority were held the reins of the people hath embraced the faith nay they have striven against it with such animosity and determination that no ear hath heard and no eye hath seen the like the báb the lord the most exalted—may the life of all be sacrifice unto him—hath specifically revealed an epistle unto the divines of every city wherein he hath fully set forth the character of the denial and repudiation of each of them “wherefore take ye good heed ye who are men of insight by his references to their opposition he intended to invalidate the objections which the people of the bayán might raise in the day of the manifestation of “mustagháth the day of the latter resurrection claiming that whereas in the dispensation of the bayán number of divines have embraced the faith in this latter revelation none of these hath recognized his claim his purpose was to warn the people lest god forbid they cling to such foolish thoughts and deprive themselves of the divine beauty yea these divines to whom we have referred were mostly unrenowned and by the grace of god they were all purged of earthly vanities and free from the trappings of leadership “such is the bounty of god to whom he will he giveth it another proof and evidence of the truth of this revelation which amongst all other proofs shineth as the sun is the constancy of the eternal beauty in proclaiming the faith of god though young and tender of age and though the cause he revealed was contrary to the desire of all the peoples of earth both high and low rich and poor exalted and abased king and subject yet he arose and steadfastly proclaimed it all have known and heard this he was afraid of no one he was regardless of consequences could such thing be made manifest except through the power of divine revelation and the potency of god’s invincible will by the righteousness of god were any one to entertain so great revelation in his heart the thought of such declaration would alone confound him were the hearts of all men to be crowded into his heart he would still hesitate to venture upon so awful an enterprise he could achieve it only by the permission of god only if the channel of his heart were to be linked with the source of divine grace and his soul be assured of the unfailing sustenance of the almighty to what we wonder do they ascribe so great daring do they accuse him of folly as they accused the prophets of old or do they maintain that his motive was none other than leadership and the acquisition of earthly riches gracious god in his book which he hath entitled “qayyúmu’l asmá’”—the first the greatest and mightiest of all books—he prophesied his own martyrdom in it is this passage “o thou remnant of god have sacrificed myself wholly for thee have accepted curses for thy sake and have yearned for naught but martyrdom in the path of thy love sufficient witness unto me is god the exalted the protector the ancient of days likewise in his interpretation of the letter “há’ he craved martyrdom saying “methinks heard voice calling in my inmost being ‘do thou sacrifice the thing which thou lovest most in the path of god even as ḥusayn peace be upon him hath offered up his life for my sake and were not regardful of this inevitable mystery by him who hath my being between his hands even if all the kings of the earth were to be leagued together they would be powerless to take from me single letter how much less can these servants who are worthy of no attention and who verily are of the outcast… that all may know the degree of my patience my resignation and self sacrifice in the path of god could the revealer of such utterance be regarded as walking any way but the way of god and as having yearned for aught else except his good pleasure in this very verse there lieth concealed breath of detachment which if it were to be breathed full upon the world all beings would renounce their lives and sacrifice their souls reflect upon the villainous behavior of this generation and witness their astounding ingratitude observe how they have closed their eyes to all this glory and are abjectly pursuing those foul carcasses from whose bellies ascendeth the cry of the swallowed substance of the faithful and yet what unseemly calumnies they have hurled against those daysprings of holiness thus do we recount unto thee that which the hands of the infidels have wrought they who in the day of resurrection have turned their face away from the divine presence whom god hath tormented with the fire of their own misbelief and for whom he hath prepared in the world to come chastisement which shall devour both their bodies and souls for these have said “god is powerless and his hand of mercy is fettered steadfastness in the faith is sure testimony and glorious evidence of the truth even as the “seal of the prophets” hath said “two verses have made me old both these verses are indicative of constancy in the cause of god even as he saith “be thou steadfast as thou hast been bidden and now consider how this sadrih of the riḍván of god hath in the prime of youth risen to proclaim the cause of god behold what steadfastness that beauty of god hath revealed the whole world rose to hinder him yet it utterly failed the more severe the persecution they inflicted on that sadrih of blessedness the more his fervor increased and the brighter burned the flame of his love all this is evident and none disputeth its truth finally he surrendered his soul and winged his flight unto the realms above and among the evidences of the truth of his manifestation were the ascendancy the transcendent power and supremacy which he the revealer of being and manifestation of the adored hath unaided and alone revealed throughout the world no sooner had that eternal beauty revealed himself inshíráz in the year sixty and rent asunder the veil of concealment than the signs of the ascendancy the might the sovereignty and power emanating from that essence of essences and sea of seas were manifest in every land so much so that from every city there appeared the signs the evidences the tokens the testimonies of that divine luminary how many were those pure and kindly hearts which faithfully reflected the light of that eternal sun and how manifold the emanations of knowledge from that ocean of divine wisdom which encompassed all beings in every city all the divines and dignitaries rose to hinder and repress them and girded up the loins of malice of envy and tyranny for their suppression how great the number of those holy souls those essences of justice who accused of tyranny were put to death and how many embodiments of purity who showed forth naught but true knowledge and stainless deeds suffered an agonizing death notwithstanding all this each of these holy beings up to his last moment breathed the name of god and soared in the realm of submission and resignation such was the potency and transmuting influence which he exercised over them that they ceased to cherish any desire but his will and wedded their soul to his remembrance reflect who in this world is able to manifest such transcendent power such pervading influence all these stainless hearts and sanctified souls have with absolute resignation responded to the summons of his decree instead of complaining they rendered thanks unto god and amidst the darkness of their anguish they revealed naught but radiant acquiescence to his will it is evident how relentless was the hate and how bitter the malice and enmity entertained by all the peoples of the earth towards these companions the persecution and pain they inflicted on these holy and spiritual beings were regarded by them as means unto salvation prosperity and everlasting success hath the world since the days of adam witnessed such tumult such violent commotion notwithstanding all the torture they suffered and manifold the afflictions they endured they became the object of universal opprobrium and execration methinks patience was revealed only by virtue of their fortitude and faithfulness itself was begotten only by their deeds do thou ponder these momentous happenings in thy heart so that thou mayest apprehend the greatness of this revelation and perceive its stupendous glory then shall the spirit of faith through the grace of the merciful be breathed into thy being and thou shalt be established and abide upon the seat of certitude the one god is my witness wert thou to ponder while thou wilt recognize that apart from all these established truths and above mentioned evidences the repudiation cursing and execration pronounced by the people of the earth are in themselves the mightiest proof and the surest testimony of the truth of these heroes of the field of resignation and detachment whenever thou dost meditate upon the cavils uttered by all the people be they divines learned or ignorant the firmer and the more steadfast wilt thou grow in the faith for whatsoever hath come to pass hath been prophesied by them who are the mines of divine knowledge and recipients of god’s eternal law although we did not intend to make mention of the traditions of bygone age yet because of our love for thee we will cite few which are applicable to our argument we do not feel their necessity however inasmuch as the things we have already mentioned suffice the world and all that is therein in fact all the scriptures and the mysteries thereof are condensed into this brief account so much so that were person to ponder it while in his heart he would discover from all that hath been said the mysteries of the words of god and would apprehend the meaning of whatever hath been manifested by that ideal king as the people differ in their understanding and station we will accordingly make mention of few traditions that these may impart constancy to the wavering soul and tranquillity to the troubled mind thereby will the testimony of god unto the people both high and low be complete and perfect among them is the tradition “and when the standard of truth is made manifest the people of both the east and the west curse it the wine of renunciation must needs be quaffed the lofty heights of detachment must needs be attained and the meditation referred to in the words “one hour’s reflection is preferable to seventy years of pious worship” must needs be observed so that the secret of the wretched behavior of the people might be discovered those people who despite the love and yearning for truth which they profess curse the followers of truth when once he hath been made manifest to this truth the above mentioned tradition beareth witness it is evident that the reason for such behavior is none other than the annulment of those rules customs habits and ceremonials to which they have been subjected otherwise were the beauty of the merciful to comply with those same rules and customs which are current amongst the people and were he to sanction their observances such conflict and mischief would in no wise be made manifest in the world this exalted tradition is attested and substantiated by these words which he hath revealed “the day when the summoner shall summon to stern business the divine call of the celestial herald from beyond the veil of glory summoning mankind to renounce utterly all the things to which they cleave is repugnant to their desire and this is the cause of the bitter trials and violent commotions which have occurred consider the way of the people they ignore these well founded traditions all of which have been fulfilled and cling unto those of doubtful validity and ask why these have not been fulfilled and yet those things which to them were inconceivable have been made manifest the signs and tokens of the truth shine even as the midday sun and yet the people are wandering aimlessly and perplexedly in the wilderness of ignorance and folly notwithstanding all the verses of the qur’án and the recognized traditions which are all indicative of new faith new law and new revelation this generation still waiteth in expectation of beholding the promised one who should uphold the law of the muḥammadan dispensation the jews and the christians in like manner uphold the same contention among the utterances that foreshadow new law and new revelation are the passages in the “prayer of nudbih” “where is he who is preserved to renew the ordinances and laws where is he who hath the authority to transform the faith and the followers thereof he hath likewise revealed in the zíyárat “peace be upon the truth made new abú ‘abdi’lláh questioned concerning the character of the mihdí answered saying “he will perform that which muḥammad the messenger of god hath performed and will demolish whatever hath been before him even as the messenger of god hath demolished the ways of those that preceded him behold how notwithstanding these and similar traditions they idly contend that the laws formerly revealed must in no wise be altered and yet is not the object of every revelation to effect transformation in the whole character of mankind transformation that shall manifest itself both outwardly and inwardly that shall affect both its inner life and external conditions for if the character of mankind be not changed the futility of god’s universal manifestation would be apparent in the “‘aválim an authoritative and well known book it is recorded “a youth from baní háshim shall be made manifest who will reveal new book and promulgate new law” then follow these words “most of his enemies will be the divines in another passage it is related of ṣádiq son of muḥammad that he spoke the following “there shall appear youth from baní háshim who will bid the people plight fealty unto him his book will be new book unto which he shall summon the people to pledge their faith stern is his revelation unto the arab if ye hear about him hasten unto him how well have they followed the directions of the imáms of the faith and lamps of certitude although it is clearly stated “were ye to hear that youth from baní háshim hath appeared summoning the people unto new and divine book and to new and divine laws hasten unto him yet have they all declared that lord of being an infidel and pronounced him heretic they hastened not unto that háshimite light that divine manifestation except with drawn swords and hearts filled with malice moreover observe how explicitly the enmity of the divines hath been mentioned in the books notwithstanding all these evident and significant traditions all these unmistakable and undisputed allusions the people have rejected the immaculate essence of knowledge and of holy utterance and have turned unto the exponents of rebellion and error despite these recorded traditions and revealed utterances they speak only that which is prompted by their own selfish desires and should the essence of truth reveal that which is contrary to their inclinations and desires they will straightway denounce him as an infidel and will protest saying “this is contrary to the sayings of the imáms of the faith and of the resplendent lights no such thing hath been provided by our inviolable law even so in this day such worthless statements have been and are being made by these poor mortals and now consider this other tradition and observe how all these things have been foretold in “arba‘ín” it is recorded “out of baní háshim there shall come forth youth who shall reveal new laws he shall summon the people unto him but none will heed his call most of his enemies will be the divines his bidding they will not obey but will protest saying ‘this is contrary to that which hath been handed down unto us by the imáms of the faith ’” in this day all are repeating these very same words utterly unaware that he is established upon the throne of “he doeth whatsoever he willeth and abideth upon the seat of “he ordaineth whatsoever he pleaseth no understanding can grasp the nature of his revelation nor can any knowledge comprehend the full measure of his faith all sayings are dependent upon his sanction and all things stand in need of his cause all else save him are created by his command and move and have their being through his law he is the revealer of the divine mysteries and the expounder of the hidden and ancient wisdom thus it is related in the “biḥáru’l anvár the “‘aválim and the “yanbú‘” of ṣádiq son of muḥammad that he spoke these words “knowledge is twenty and seven letters all that the prophets have revealed are two letters thereof no man thus far hath known more than these two letters but when the qá’im shall arise he will cause the remaining twenty and five letters to be made manifest consider he hath declared knowledge to consist of twenty and seven letters and regarded all the prophets from adam even unto the “seal as expounders of only two letters thereof and of having been sent down with these two letters he also saith that the qá’im will reveal all the remaining twenty and five letters behold from this utterance how great and lofty is his station his rank excelleth that of all the prophets and his revelation transcendeth the comprehension and understanding of all their chosen ones revelation of which the prophets of god his saints and chosen ones have either not been informed or which in pursuance of god’s inscrutable decree they have not disclosed—such revelation these mean and depraved people have sought to measure with their own deficient minds their own deficient learning and understanding should it fail to conform to their standards they straightway reject it “thinkest thou that the greater part of them hear or understand they are even like unto the brutes yea they stray even further from the path how we wonder do they explain the aforementioned tradition tradition which in unmistakable terms foreshadoweth the revelation of things inscrutable and the occurrence of new and wondrous events in his day such marvelous happenings kindle so great strife amongst the people that all the divines and doctors sentence him and his companions to death and all the peoples of the earth arise to oppose him even as it hath been recorded in the “káfí in the tradition of jábir in the “tablet of fáṭimih concerning the character of the qá’im “he shall manifest the perfection of moses the splendor of jesus and the patience of job his chosen ones shall be abased in his day their heads shall be offered as presents even as the heads of the turks and the daylamites they shall be slain and burnt fear shall seize them dismay and alarm shall strike terror into their hearts the earth shall be dyed with their blood their womenfolk shall bewail and lament these indeed are my friends consider not single letter of this tradition hath remained unfulfilled in most of the places their blessed blood hath been shed in every city they have been made captives have been paraded throughout the provinces and some have been burnt with fire and yet no one hath paused to reflect that if the promised qá’im should reveal the law and ordinances of former dispensation why then should such traditions have been recorded and why should there arise such degree of strife and conflict that the people should regard the slaying of these companions as an obligation imposed upon them and deem the persecution of these holy souls as means of attaining unto the highest favor moreover observe how these things that have come to pass and the acts which have been perpetrated have all been mentioned in former traditions even as it hath been recorded in the “rawḍiy káfí concerning “zawrá’ in the “rawḍiy káfí” it is related of mu‘ávíyih son of vahháb that abú ‘abdi’lláh hath spoken “knowest thou zawrá’ said “may my life be sacrifice unto thee they say it is baghdád “nay he answered and then added “hast thou entered the city of rayy to which made reply “yea have entered it whereupon he inquired “didst thou visit the cattle market “yea answered he said “hast thou seen the black mountain on the right hand side of the road the same is zawrá’ there shall eighty men of the children of certain ones be slain all of whom are worthy to be called caliphs “who will slay them asked he made reply “the children of persia such is the condition and fate of his companions which in former days hath been foretold and now observe how according to this tradition zawrá’ is no other but the land of rayy in that place his companions have been with great suffering put to death and all these holy beings have suffered martyrdom at the hand of the persians as recorded in the tradition this thou hast heard and unto it all testify wherefore then do not these groveling worm like men pause to meditate upon these traditions all of which are manifest as the sun in its noontide glory for what reason do they refuse to embrace the truth and allow certain traditions the significance of which they have failed to grasp to withhold them from the recognition of the revelation of god and his beauty and to cause them to dwell in the infernal abyss such things are to be attributed to naught but the faithlessness of the divines and doctors of the age of these ṣádiq son of muḥammad hath said “the religious doctors of that age shall be the most wicked of the divines beneath the shadow of heaven out of them hath mischief proceeded and unto them it shall return we entreat the learned men of the bayán not to follow in such ways not to inflict at the time of mustagháth upon him who is the divine essence the heavenly light the absolute eternity the beginning and the end of the manifestations of the invisible that which hath been inflicted in this day we beg them not to depend upon their intellect their comprehension and learning nor to contend with the revealer of celestial and infinite knowledge and yet notwithstanding all these admonitions we perceive that one eyed man who himself is the chief of the people is arising with the utmost malevolence against us we foresee that in every city people will arise to suppress the blessed beauty that the companions of that lord of being and ultimate desire of all men will flee from the face of the oppressor and seek refuge from him in the wilderness whilst others will resign themselves and with absolute detachment will sacrifice their lives in his path methinks we can discern one who is reputed for such devoutness and piety that men deem it an obligation to obey him and to whose command they consider it necessary to submit who will arise to assail the very root of the divine tree and endeavor to the uttermost of his power to resist and oppose him such is the way of the people we fain would hope that the people of the bayán will be enlightened will soar in the realm of the spirit and abide therein will discern the truth and recognize with the eye of insight dissembling falsehood in these days however such odors of jealousy are diffused that—i swear by the educator of all beings visible and invisible—from the beginning of the foundation of the world—though it hath no beginning—until the present day such malice envy and hate have in no wise appeared nor will they ever be witnessed in the future for number of people who have never inhaled the fragrance of justice have raised the standard of sedition and have leagued themselves against us on every side we witness the menace of their spears and in all directions we recognize the shafts of their arrows this although we have never gloried in any thing nor did we seek preference over any soul to everyone we have been most kindly companion most forbearing and affectionate friend in the company of the poor we have sought their fellowship and amidst the exalted and learned we have been submissive and resigned swear by god the one true god grievous as have been the woes and sufferings which the hand of the enemy and the people of the book inflicted upon us yet all these fade into utter nothingness when compared with that which hath befallen us at the hand of those who profess to be our friends what more shall we say the universe were it to gaze with the eye of justice would be incapable of bearing the weight of this utterance in the early days of our arrival in this land when we discerned the signs of impending events we decided ere they happened to retire we betook ourselves to the wilderness and there separated and alone led for two years life of complete solitude from our eyes there rained tears of anguish and in our bleeding heart there surged an ocean of agonizing pain many night we had no food for sustenance and many day our body found no rest by him who hath my being between his hands notwithstanding these showers of afflictions and unceasing calamities our soul was wrapt in blissful joy and our whole being evinced an ineffable gladness for in our solitude we were unaware of the harm or benefit the health or ailment of any soul alone we communed with our spirit oblivious of the world and all that is therein we knew not however that the mesh of divine destiny exceedeth the vastest of mortal conceptions and the dart of his decree transcendeth the boldest of human designs none can escape the snares he setteth and no soul can find release except through submission to his will by the righteousness of god our withdrawal contemplated no return and our separation hoped for no reunion the one object of our retirement was to avoid becoming subject of discord among the faithful source of disturbance unto our companions the means of injury to any soul or the cause of sorrow to any heart beyond these we cherished no other intention and apart from them we had no end in view and yet each person schemed after his own desire and pursued his own idle fancy until the hour when from the mystic source there came the summons bidding us return whence we came surrendering our will to his we submitted to his injunction what pen can recount the things we beheld upon our return two years have elapsed during which our enemies have ceaselessly and assiduously contrived to exterminate us whereunto all witness nevertheless none amongst the faithful hath risen to render us any assistance nor did anyone feel inclined to help in our deliverance nay instead of assisting us what showers of continuous sorrows their words and deeds have caused to rain upon our soul amidst them all we stand life in hand wholly resigned to his will that perchance through god’s loving kindness and his grace this revealed and manifest letter may lay down his life as sacrifice in the path of the primal point the most exalted word by him at whose bidding the spirit hath spoken but for this yearning of our soul we would not for one moment have tarried any longer in this city “sufficient witness is god unto us we conclude our argument with the words “there is no power nor strength but in god alone “we are god’s and to him shall we return they that have hearts to understand they that have quaffed the wine of love who have not for one moment gratified their selfish desires will behold resplendent as the sun in its noontide glory those tokens testimonies and evidences that attest the truth of this wondrous revelation this transcendent and divine faith reflect how the people have rejected the beauty of god and have clung unto their covetous desires notwithstanding all these consummate verses these unmistakable allusions which have been revealed in the “most weighty revelation the trust of god amongst men and despite these evident traditions each more manifest than the most explicit utterance the people have ignored and repudiated their truth and have held fast to the letter of certain traditions which according to their understanding they have found inconsistent with their expectations and the meaning of which they have failed to grasp they have thus shattered every hope and deprived themselves of the pure wine of the all glorious and the clear and incorruptible waters of the immortal beauty consider that even the year in which that quintessence of light is to be made manifest hath been specifically recorded in the traditions yet they still remain unmindful nor do they for one moment cease to pursue their selfish desires according to the tradition mufaḍḍal asked ṣádiq saying “what of the sign of his manifestation my master he made reply “in the year sixty his cause shall be made manifest and his name shall be proclaimed how strange notwithstanding these explicit and manifest references these people have shunned the truth for instance mention of the sorrows the imprisonment and afflictions inflicted upon that essence of divine virtue hath been made in the former traditions in the “biḥár” it is recorded “in our qá’im there shall be four signs from four prophets moses jesus joseph and muḥammad the sign from moses is fear and expectation from jesus that which was spoken of him from joseph imprisonment and dissimulation from muḥammad the revelation of book similar to the qur’án notwithstanding such conclusive tradition which in such unmistakable language hath foreshadowed the happenings of the present day none hath been found to heed its prophecy and methinks none will do so in the future except him whom thy lord willeth “god indeed shall make whom he will to hearken but we shall not make those who are in their graves to hearken it is evident unto thee that the birds of heaven and doves of eternity speak twofold language one language the outward language is devoid of allusions is unconcealed and unveiled that it may be guiding lamp and beaconing light whereby wayfarers may attain the heights of holiness and seekers may advance into the realm of eternal reunion such are the unveiled traditions and the evident verses already mentioned the other language is veiled and concealed so that whatever lieth hidden in the heart of the malevolent may be made manifest and their innermost being be disclosed thus hath ṣádiq son of muḥammad spoken “god verily will test them and sift them this is the divine standard this is the touchstone of god wherewith he proveth his servants none apprehendeth the meaning of these utterances except them whose hearts are assured whose souls have found favor with god and whose minds are detached from all else but him in such utterances the literal meaning as generally understood by the people is not what hath been intended thus it is recorded “every knowledge hath seventy meanings of which one only is known amongst the people and when the qá’im shall arise he shall reveal unto men all that which remaineth he also saith “we speak one word and by it we intend one and seventy meanings each one of these meanings we can explain these things we mention only that the people may not be dismayed because of certain traditions and utterances which have not yet been literally fulfilled that they may rather attribute their perplexity to their own lack of understanding and not to the nonfulfillment of the promises in the traditions inasmuch as the meaning intended by the imáms of the faith is not known by this people as evidenced by the traditions themselves the people therefore must not allow such utterances to deprive them of the divine bounties but should rather seek enlightenment from them who are the recognized expounders thereof so that the hidden mysteries may be unraveled and be made manifest unto them we perceive none however amongst the people of the earth who sincerely yearning for the truth seeketh the guidance of the divine manifestations concerning the abstruse matters of his faith all are dwellers in the land of oblivion and all are followers of the people of wickedness and rebellion god will verily do unto them that which they themselves are doing and will forget them even as they have ignored his presence in his day such is his decree unto those that have denied him and such will it be unto them that have rejected his signs we conclude our argument with his words—exalted is he—“and whoso shall withdraw from the remembrance of the merciful we will chain satan unto him and he shall be his fast companion “and whoso turneth away from my remembrance truly his shall be life of misery thus hath it been revealed aforetime were ye to comprehend revealed by the “bá’” and the “há’ peace be upon him that

invisible world and thy sanctified cities magnify thou moreover such as have believed in him and in his signs and have turned towards him from among those that have acknowledged thy unity in his latter manifestation—a manifestation whereof he hath made mention in his tablets and in his books and in his scriptures and in all the wondrous verses and gem like utterances that have descended upon him it is this same manifestation whose covenant thou hast bidden him establish ere he had established his own covenant he it is whose praise the bayán hath celebrated in it his excellence hath been extolled and his truth established and his sovereignty proclaimed and his cause perfected blessed is the man that hath turned unto him and fulfilled the things he hath commanded thou who art the lord

thine eternal holiness and grandeur the eyes of all beings have been opened to behold the beauty of thy radiant countenance yet none hath succeeded in gazing on the brightness of the light of thy face the hands of them that are nigh unto thee have ever since the foundation of thy glorious sovereignty and the establishment of thy holy dominion been raised suppliantly towards thee yet no one hath been able to touch the hem of the robe that clotheth thy divine and sovereign essence and yet none can deny that thou hast ever been through the wonders of thy generosity and bounty supreme over all things art powerful to do all things and art nearer unto all things than they are unto themselves far be it then from thy glory that anyone should gaze on thy wondrous beauty with any eye save thine own eye or hear the melodies proclaiming thine almighty sovereignty with any ear except thine own ear too high art thou exalted for the eye of any creature to behold thy beauty or for the understanding of any heart to scale the heights of thine immeasurable knowledge for should the birds of the hearts of them that are nigh unto thee be ever enabled to soar as long as thine own overpowering sovereignty can endure or to ascend as long as the empire of thy divine holiness can last they shall in no wise be able to transcend the limitations which contingent world hath imposed upon them nor pass beyond its confines how then can he whose very creation is restricted by such limitations attain unto him who is the lord of the kingdom of all created things or ascend into the heaven of him who ruleth the realms of loftiness and grandeur glorified immeasurably glorified art thou my best beloved inasmuch as thou hast ordained that the utmost limit to which they who lift their hearts to thee can rise is the confession of their powerlessness to enter the realms of thy holy and transcendent unity and that the highest station which they who aspire to know thee can reach is the acknowledgment of their impotence to attain the retreats of thy sublime knowledge therefore beseech thee by this very powerlessness which is beloved of thee and which thou hast decreed as the goal of them that have reached and attained thy court and by the splendors of thy countenance that have encompassed all things and by the energies of thy will whereby the entire creation hath been generated not to deprive them that have set their hopes in thee of the wonders of thy mercy nor to withhold from such as have sought thee the treasures of thy grace ignite then within their hearts the torch of thy love that its flame may consume all else except their wondrous remembrance of thee and that no trace may be left in those hearts except the gem like evidences of thy most holy sovereignty so that from the land wherein they dwell no voice may be heard except the voice that extolleth thy mercifulness and might that on the earth on which they walk no light may shine except the light of thy beauty and that within every soul naught may be discovered except the revelation of thy countenance and the tokens of thy glory that haply thy servants may show forth only that which shall please thee and shall conform wholly unto thy most potent will glory be to thee my god the power of thy might beareth me witness can have no doubt that should the holy breaths of thy loving kindness and the breeze of thy bountiful favor cease for less than the twinkling of an eye to breathe over all created things the entire creation would perish and all that are in heaven and on earth would be reduced to utter nothingness magnified therefore be the marvelous evidences of thy transcendent power magnified be the potency of thine exalted might magnified be the majesty of thine all encompassing greatness and the energizing influence of thy will such is thy greatness that wert thou to concentrate the eyes of all men in the eye of one of thy servants and to compress all their hearts within his heart and wert thou to enable him to behold within himself all the things thou hast created through thy power and fashioned through thy might and were he to ponder throughout eternity over the realms of thy creation and the range of thy handiwork he would unfailingly discover that there is no created thing but is overshadowed by thine all conquering power and is vitalized through thine all embracing sovereignty behold me then my god fallen prostrate upon the dust before thee confessing my powerlessness and thine omnipotence my poverty and thy wealth mine evanescence and thine eternity mine utter abasement and thine infinite glory recognize that there is none other god but thee that thou hast no peer nor partner none to equal or rival thee in thine unapproachable loftiness thou hast from eternity been exalted above the praise of any one but thee and shalt continue for ever in thy transcendent singleness and glory to be sanctified from the glorification of any one except thine own self swear by thy might my beloved to make mention of any created thing beseemeth not thy most exalted self and to bestow any praise upon any one of thy creatures would be wholly unworthy of thy great glory nay such mention would be but blasphemy uttered within the court of thy holiness and such praise would amount to no less than transgression in the face of the evidences of thy divine sovereignty for the mere mention of any one of thy creatures would in itself imply an assertion of their existence before the court of thy singleness and unity such an assertion would be naught but open blasphemy an act of impiety the essence of profanity and wanton crime wherefore bear witness with my soul my spirit my entire being that should they who are the daysprings of thy most holy unity and the manifestations of thy transcendent oneness be able to soar so long as thine own sovereignty endureth and thine all compelling authority can last they will fail in the end to attain unto even the precincts of the court wherein thou didst reveal the effulgence of but one of thy most mighty names glorified glorified be therefore thy wondrous majesty glorified glorified be thine unattainable loftiness glorified glorified be the preeminence of thy kingship and the sublimity of thine authority and power the highest faculties which the learned have possessed and whatsoever truths they in their search after the gems of thy knowledge have discovered the brightest realities with which the wise have been endowed and whatever secrets they in their attempts to fathom the mysteries of thy wisdom have unraveled have all been created through the generative power of the spirit that was breathed into the pen which thy hands have fashioned how then can the thing which thy pen hath created be capable of comprehending those treasures of thy faith with which as decreed by thee that pen hath been invested how can it ever know of the fingers that grasp thy pen and of thy merciful favors with which it hath been endowed how can it already unable to reach this station be made aware of the existence of thy hand that controlleth the fingers of thy might how can it attain unto the comprehension of the nature of thy will that animateth the movement of thy hand glorified glorified be thou my god how can ever hope to ascend into the heaven of thy most holy will or gain admittance into the tabernacle of thy divine knowledge knowing as do that the minds of the wise and learned are impotent to fathom the secrets of thy handiwork—a handiwork which is itself but creation of thy will praise be to thee lord my god my master my possessor my king now that have confessed unto thee my powerlessness and the powerlessness of all created things and have acknowledged my poverty and the poverty of the entire creation call unto thee with my tongue and the tongues of all that are in heaven and on earth and beseech thee with my heart and the hearts of all that have entered beneath the shadow of thy names and thine attributes not to shut us from the doors of thy loving kindness and grace nor to suffer the breeze of thy bountiful care and favor to cease from being wafted over our souls nor to permit that our hearts be occupied with any one except thee or our minds to be busied with any remembrance save remembrance of thy self by the glory of thy might my god wert thou to set me king over thy realms and to establish me upon the throne of thy sovereignty and to deliver through thy power the reins of the entire creation into my hands and wert thou to cause me though it be for less than moment to be occupied with these things and be oblivious of the wondrous memories associated with thy most mighty most perfect and most exalted name my soul would still remain unsatisfied and the pangs of my heart unstilled nay would in that very state recognize myself as the poorest of the poor and the most wretched of the wretched magnified be thy name my god now that thou hast caused me to apprehend this truth beseech thee by thy name which no scroll can bear which no heart can imagine and no tongue can utter—a name which will remain concealed so long as thine own essence is hidden and will be glorified so long as thine own being is extolled—to unfurl ere the present year draw to close the ensigns of thine undisputed ascendancy and triumph that the whole

chains of thy desire my heart yearning to be made target for the darts of thy decree mine eyes expectant to gaze on the tokens and signs of thy wondrous mercy for whatsoever may befall me from thee is the cherished desire of them who thirst to meet thee and the supreme aspiration of such as have drawn nigh unto thy court by the glory of thy might thou my well beloved to have sacrificed my life for the manifestations of thy self to have offered up my soul in the path of the revealers of thy wondrous beauty is to have sacrificed my spirit for thy spirit my being for thy being my glory for thy glory it is as if had offered up all these things for thy sake and for the sake of thy loved ones though my body be pained by the trials that befall me from thee though it be afflicted by the revelations of thy decree yet my soul rejoiceth at having partaken of the waters of thy beauty and at having attained the shores of the ocean of thine eternity doth it beseem lover to flee from his beloved or to desert the object of his heart’s desire nay we all believe in thee and eagerly hope to enter thy presence lxi laudedbe thy name lord my god thou dost witness that thy will hath prevailed over all created things and thy mercy hath surpassed all who are in heaven and on earth and when thou didst purpose to unveil thy sovereignty and to glorify thy word and to reveal thy bounteousness and mercy thou didst raise up one of thy servants and didst choose him above all thy creatures and didst single him out for thy purpose and didst clothe him with the robe of thy guidance and didst immerse him beneath the seas of thy majesty and grandeur and didst sanctify him from all that beseemeth not the greatness of thy glory and the power of thy might and didst bid him to cry out before all that are in heaven and on earth and summon the multitudes to the manifestation of thy self and the revealer of thy signs no sooner had he proclaimed thy cause and risen up to carry out the things prescribed unto him in the tablets of thy decree than the great terror fell upon thy creatures some turned towards thee and detached themselves from all except thee and sanctified their souls from the world and all that is therein and were so enravished by the sweetness of thy voice that they forsook all thou hadst created in the kingdom of thy creation others recognized thee and then hesitated others allowed the world to come in between them and thee and to withhold them from recognizing thee others disdained thee and turned back from thee and wished to prevent thee from achieving thy purpose and yet behold how all of them are calling upon thee and are expecting the things they were promised in thy tablets and when the promised one came unto them they recognized him not and disbelieved in thy signs and repudiated thy clear tokens and strayed so grievously from thy path that they slew thy servants through the brightness of whose faces the countenances of the concourse on high have been illumined beseech thee thou who art the lord of all names to guard thy loved ones against thine enemies and to strengthen them in their love for thee and in fulfilling thy pleasure do

my god who hath unlocked the gate of heaven with the key of thy name the ever blessed the all powerful the all glorious the most great and hast summoned all mankind to the ocean of thy presence no sooner had thy most sweet voice been raised than all the inmates of the kingdom of names and the concourse on high were stirred up by thy call the fragrance of the raiment of thy revelation was wafted over such of thy creatures as have loved thee and such of thy people as have yearned towards thee they rose up and rushed forth to attain the ocean of thy meeting and the horizon of thy beauty and the tabernacle of thy revelation and thy majesty and the sanctuary of thy presence and thy glory they were so inebriated with the wine of their reunion with thee that they rid themselves of all attachment to whatever they themselves and others possessed these are thy servants whom the ascendancy of the oppressor hath failed to deter from fixing their eyes on the tabernacle of thy majesty and whom the hosts of tyranny have been powerless to affright and divert their gaze from the dayspring of thy signs and the dawning place of thy testimonies swear by thy glory thou the lord of all being and the enlightener of all things visible and invisible whoso hath quaffed from the hands of thy bounteousness the living waters of thy love will never allow the things pertaining to thy creatures to keep him

people the tumult of the ocean of thy bounty and the splendors of the luminaries of the heaven of thy bestowals happy indeed is the man that hath turned towards the sanctuary of thy presence and rid himself of all attachment to any one except thyself he is truly exalted who hath confessed thy glory and fixed his eyes upon the daystar of thy loving kindness he is endued with understanding who is aware of thy revelation and hath acknowledged thy manifold tokens thy signs and thy testimonies he is man of insight whose eyes have been illumined with the brightness of thy face and who as soon as thy call was raised hath recognized thee he is man of hearing who hath been led to hearken unto thy speech and to draw nigh unto the billowing ocean of thine utterances behold thou this stranger my lord who hath hastened to attain his most exalted home in the shelter of thy shadowing mercy and this ailing soul who hath set his face towards the ocean of thy healing look then thou my god who settest my soul on fire upon the tears shed and the sighs utter and the anguish that afflicteth my heart and the fire that consumeth my being thy glory beareth me witness thou the light of the world the fire of thy love that burneth continually within me hath so inflamed me that whoever among thy creatures approacheth me and inclineth his inner ear towards me cannot fail to hear its raging within each of my veins am so carried away by the sweetness of thine utterances and so inebriated with the wine of thy tender mercies that my voice can never be stilled nor can my suppliant hands any longer desist from being stretched out towards thee thou seest my lord how mine eyes are fixed in the direction of thy grace and mine ears inclined towards the kingdom of thine utterance and my tongue unloosed to celebrate thy praise and my face set towards thy face that surviveth all that hath been created by thy word and my hands raised up towards the heaven of thy bounty and favor wilt thou keep back from thee the stranger whom thou didst call unto his most exalted home beneath the shadow of the wings of thy mercy or cast away the wretched creature that hath hastened to attain the shores of the ocean of thy wealth wilt thou shut up the door of thy grace to the face of thy creatures after having opened it through the power of thy might and of thy sovereignty or close the eyes of thy people when thou hast already commanded them to turn unto the dayspring of thy beauty and the dawning place of the splendors of thy countenance nay and to this thy glory beareth me witness such is not my thought of thee nor the thought of those of thy servants that have near access to thyself nor that of the sincere amongst thy people thou knowest and seest and hearest my lord that before every tree am moved to lift up my voice to thee and before every stone am impelled to sigh and lament hath it been thy purpose in creating me my god to touch me with tribulation or to enable me to manifest thy cause in the kingdom of thy creation thou hearest my god my sighs and my groaning and beholdest my powerlessness and my poverty and my misery and my woes and my wretchedness swear by thy might have wept with such weeping that have been unable to make mention of thee or to extol thee and cried with such bitter cry that every mother in her bereavement was bewildered at me and forgot her own anguish and the sighs she had uttered implore thee my lord by thine ark through which the potency of thy will was manifested and the energizing influences of thy purpose were revealed and which saileth on both land and sea through the power of thy might not to seize me in my mighty sins and great trespasses swear by thy glory the waters of thy forgiveness and thy mercy have emboldened me as hath thy dealing in bygone ages with the sincere among thy chosen ones and with such of thy messengers as have proclaimed thy oneness am well aware my lord that have been so carried away by the clear tokens of thy loving kindness and so completely inebriated with the wine of thine utterance that whatever behold readily discover that it maketh thee known unto me and it remindeth me of thy signs and of thy tokens and of thy testimonies by thy glory every time lift up mine eyes unto thy heaven call to mind thy highness and thy loftiness and thine incomparable glory and greatness and every time turn my gaze to thine earth am made to recognize the evidences of thy power and the tokens of thy bounty and when behold the sea find that it speaketh to me of thy majesty and of the potency of thy might and of thy sovereignty and thy grandeur and at whatever time contemplate the mountains am led to discover the ensigns of thy victory and the standards of thine omnipotence swear by thy might thou in whose grasp are the reins of all mankind and the destinies of the nations am so inflamed by my love for thee and so inebriated with the wine of thy oneness that can hear from the whisper of the winds the sound of thy glorification and praise and can recognize in the murmur of the waters the voice that proclaimeth thy virtues and thine attributes and can apprehend from the rustling of the leaves the mysteries that have been irrevocably ordained by thee in thy realm glorified art thou god of all names and creator of the heavens render thee thanks that thou hast made known unto thy servants this day whereon the river that is life indeed hath flowed forth from the fingers of thy bounty and the springtime of thy revelation and thy presence hath appeared through thy manifestation unto all who are in thy heaven and all who are on thy earth this is the day my lord whose brightness thou hast exalted above the brightness of the sun and the splendors thereof testify that the light it sheddeth proceedeth out of the glory of the light of thy countenance and is begotten by the radiance of the morn of thy revelation this is the day whereon the hopeless have been clothed with the raiment of confidence and the sick attired with the robe of healing and the poor drawn nigh unto the ocean of thy riches swear by thy beauty king of eternity who sittest on thy most glorious throne he who is the dayspring of thy signs and the revealer of thy clear tokens hath notwithstanding the immensity of his wisdom and the loftiness of his knowledge confessed his powerlessness to comprehend the least of thine utterances in their relation to thy most exalted pen —how much more is he incapable of apprehending the nature of thine all glorious self and of thy most august essence cannot think my god of any words wherewith to make mention of thee and know not how to express or extol thee were to attempt to describe thee by thy names would readily recognize that the kingdom of these names is itself created through the movement of thy fingers and trembleth for fear of thee and were to venture to extol thine attributes would be forced to admit that these attributes are thine own creation and lie within thy grasp it behooveth not them who are the manifestations of these names and attributes to stand before the gate of the city of thy revelation how much less to scale the heights whereon thou didst stablish the throne of thy majesty swear by thy might thou who art the king of names and the maker of the heavens whatsoever hath been adorned with the robe of words is but thy creation which hath been generated in thy realm and begotten through the operation of thy will and is wholly unworthy of thy highness and falleth short of thine excellence and since it hath been demonstrated that thy most august self is immeasurably exalted above all that hath been created in the world of being and is far above the reach and ken of the apprehension of thy chosen ones and thy loved ones the splendors of the light of thy unity are therefore manifested and it becometh evident unto every one whether free or bond that thou art one in thine own self one in thy cause and one in thy revelation great is the blessedness of the man who in his love towards thee hath rid himself of all attachment from every one except thyself and hastened unto the horizon of thy revelation and attained unto this cup which thou hast caused to excel all the seas of the earth beg of thee my god by thy power and thy might and thy sovereignty which have embraced all who are in thy heaven and on thy earth to make known unto thy servants this luminous way and this straight path that they may acknowledge thy unity and thy oneness with certainty which the vain imaginations of the doubters will not impair nor the idle fancies of the wayward obscure illumine my lord the eyes of thy servants and brighten their hearts with the splendors of the light of thy knowledge that they may apprehend the greatness of this most sublime station and recognize this most luminous horizon that haply the clamor of men may fail to deter them from turning their gaze towards the effulgent light of thy unity and to hinder them from setting their faces toward the horizon of detachment this is the day my lord which thou didst announce unto all mankind as the day whereon thou wouldst reveal thy self and shed thy radiance and shine brightly over all thy creatures thou hast moreover entered into covenant with them in thy books and thy scriptures and thy scrolls and thy tablets concerning him who is the dayspring of thy revelation and hast appointed the bayán to be the herald of this most great and all glorious manifestation and this most resplendent and most sublime appearance and when the world’s horizon was illumined and he who is the most great name was manifested all disbelieved in him and in his signs except such as have been carried away by the sweetness of thy glorification and praise there befell him what must remain inscrutable to everyone except thee whose knowledge transcendeth all who are in thy heaven and all who are on thy earth thou well knowest my god that the revealer of the bayán the báb hath commanded all mankind concerning thy cause and thy revelation and thy sovereignty he hath said and sweet is his speech “beware lest the bayán and its letters keep you back from him who is the most merciful and from his sovereignty he moreover hath written “were he to produce no more than one verse ye must not deny him haste ye towards him that haply he may cause to descend upon you what he pleaseth as token of his grace unto you he truly is the possessor of his servants and the king of creation thou seest then thou who art the beloved of the world and the revealer of the most great name how he hath come down with the kingdom of his signs and in manner that hath caused the atoms of the earth to testify that the whole world hath been filled with these signs and yet notwithstanding this most manifest and all glorious revelation and these signs which none can appraise except thee thou the king of names thou beholdest how they have broken off from him who is the dayspring of thine essence and have caviled at the one who is the fountainhead of thy wisdom and of thine utterance they were so seized with thirst for fame that they rejected thy tokens and thy testimonies and thy signs which every man of insight perceiveth in whatsoever declareth thy greatness and thy sovereignty and acknowledgeth thy revelation and thy might they have so traduced him as to cause the inmates of the all glorious tabernacle and the concourse on high to lament and have uttered such calumnies against him that the souls of thy chosen ones and the hearts of them that are dear to thee have melted they have erred so grievously that they cast away thy most resplendent signs and clung to their idle fancies thou who art the possessor of names and the lord of the throne on high and of earth below thou art my god and the exultation of my heart the one who hath adorned thy tablet of which none is aware except thee with the mention of this day which thou didst call after thy name that haply none may on that day be seen save thy most august self and naught else be brought to mind except thy most sweet remembrance no sooner had he revealed himself than the foundations of the kindreds of the earth shook and trembled and the learned swooned away and the wise were bewildered except such as have through the power of thy might drawn nigh unto thee and received the choice wine of thy revelation from the hand of thy grace and have quaffed it in thy name and exclaimed “praise be unto thee thou the desire of the worlds and glory be to thee thou who art the exultation of the hearts that pant after thee my god my master my highest hope and the goal of my desire thou seest and hearest the sighing of this wronged one from this darksome well which the vain imaginations of thine adversaries have built and from this blind pit which the idle fancies of the wicked among thy creatures have digged by thy beauty thou whose glory is uncovered to the face of men am not impatient in the troubles that touch me in my love for thee neither in the adversities which suffer in thy path nay have by thy power chosen them for mine own self and glory in them amongst such of thy creatures as enjoy near access to thee and those of thy servants that are wholly devoted to thy self beseech thee however thou who art the enlightener of the world and the lord of the nations at this very moment when with the hands of hope have clung to the hem of the raiment of thy mercy and thy bounty to forgive thy servants who have soared in the atmosphere of thy nearness and set their faces towards the splendors of the light of thy countenance and turned unto the horizon of thy good pleasure and approached the ocean of thy mercy and all their lives long have spoken forth thy praise and have been inflamed with the fire of their love for thee do thou ordain for them lord my god both before and after their death what becometh the loftiness of thy bounty and the excellence of thy loving kindness grant my lord that they who have ascended unto thee may repair unto him who is the most exalted companion and abide beneath the shadow of the tabernacle of thy majesty and the sanctuary of thy glory sprinkle my lord upon them from the ocean of thy forgiveness what will make them worthy to abide so long as thine own sovereignty endureth within thy most exalted kingdom and thine all highest dominion potent art thou to do what pleaseth thee deny not thy loved ones my lord the sweet savors of this day whereon the mysteries of thy name the self subsisting were unraveled and all that had been enshrined within the treasuries of thy wisdom was revealed this is the day my lord whereon every atom of the earth hath been made to vibrate and to cry out “o thou who art the revealer of signs and the king of creation verily perceive the fragrance of thy presence methinks thou hast revealed thyself and unlocked the door of reunion with thee before all who are in thy heaven and all who are on thy earth am persuaded through the fragrance of thy robe my lord that the world hath been honored through thy presence and hath inhaled the sweet smell of thy meeting know not however thou the beloved of the world and the desire of the nations the place wherein the throne of thy majesty hath been established nor the seat which hath been made thy footstool and been illumined with the splendors of the light of thy face swear by thy glory thou who art the lord of all being and the possessor of all things visible and invisible every man of understanding hath been so bewildered at thy knowledge and every man endued with insight been so perplexed in his attempt to fathom the signs of thy great glory that all have recognized their powerlessness to visualize and their impotence to soar into the heaven wherefrom one of the luminaries of the manifestations of thy knowledge and of the daysprings of thy wisdom hath shone forth who is he that shall befittingly describe this most sublime station and this most august seat—the seat which as decreed by thee transcendeth the comprehension of thy creatures and the testimonies of thy servants and which hath everlastingly been hid from the understanding and the knowledge of men and been closed with the seal of thy name the self subsisting swear by thy glory and thy sovereignty which overshadow the kingdoms of earth and of heaven were any of thy chosen ones and thy messengers to meditate on the manifold evidences of thy most exalted pen—a pen which is driven by the fingers of thy will—and were he to muse on its mysteries and its tokens and all that it showeth forth he would be so perplexed that his tongue would fail to extol and describe thee and his heart would be utterly unable to understand thee for he would at one time discover that from this pen there floweth out unto all created things the water that is life indeed and that the pen itself hath been named by thee the trumpet whereby the dead speed out of their sepulchers at another time he would find that there proceedeth from this pen such fire as thine own revelation can kindle and as he who conversed with thee moses on sinai hath perceived how marvelous then are the manifold tokens of thy might and how great are the diverse evidences of thy power the learned have without exception admitted their ignorance when confronted with the radiance of the luminary of thy knowledge and the mighty have all confessed their impotence in the face of the billowing ocean of thy power and the rich have one and all acknowledged their poverty before the effusions of the treasuries of thy wealth and the worldly wise have each recognized their nothingness beside the splendors of the light of thy beauty and the exalted have all witnessed unto their abasement when face to face with the effulgence of the daystar of thy glory and they who are in authority have borne witness to their own evanescence and to the evanescence of others and discovered the eternity of thy majesty and of thy sovereignty and of thy sublimity and of thy power my god and the god of all things and my king and the king of all things and the beloved of my soul and the goal of my desire thou knowest full well that make mention of thee in this day in the name of such of thy creatures as have detached themselves from all except thee and extol thy virtues through the tongue of those of thy people that have recognized thy oneness that haply there may pour out from the sighs which they utter in their love and their yearning for thee what will melt away all that may hinder thy servants from setting their faces towards the heaven of thy knowledge and the kingdom of thy signs this then my god and the god of all names and the creator of earth and heaven is the day whereon he whose heart gloweth with the flaming fire of thy presence is calling upon thee where can separation from thee be found my god so that reunion with thee may be clearly recognized at the appearance of the light of thy unity and the revelation of the splendors of the sun of thy oneness ask pardon of thee my god for all that hath been said and for whatsoever hath flowed out and is now flowing out from my pen in thy days testify that thou hast decreed that the offering of prayer should befit not me but him who hath at thy bidding and in conformity with thy pleasure preceded me rather hast thou ordained that the revelation of verses should be specially attributed unto this mighty manifestation and to this announcement that hath adorned the scrolls of thy majesty and thy tablet in which account is kept render thee thanks thou who hast lighted thy fire within my soul and cast the beams of thy light into my heart that thou hast taught thy servants how to make mention of thee and revealed unto them the ways whereby they can supplicate thee through thy most holy and exalted tongue and thy most august and precious speech but for thy leave who is there that could venture to express thy might and thy grandeur and were it not for thine instruction who is the man that could discover the ways of thy pleasure in the kingdom of thy creation beseech thee god of bounty and king of all created things to guard thy servants from the imaginations which their hearts may devise raise them up then to such heights that their footsteps may slip not in the face of the evidences of thy handiwork which the manifold exigencies of thy wisdom have ordained and whose secrets thou hast hid from the face of thy people and thy creatures withhold them not my lord from the ocean of thy knowledge neither do thou deprive them of what thou didst destine for such of thy chosen ones as have near access to thee and those of thy trusted ones as are wholly devoted to thy self supply them then from thy sea of certainty with what will calm the agitation of their hearts turn lord my god the darkness of their fancies into the brightness of certitude and cause them to arise and to walk steadfastly in thy straight path that haply thy book may not hinder them from recognizing him who is its revealer and thy names from acknowledging the one who is their creator and their provider and their origin and their king and their begetter and their destroyer and their glorifier and their abaser and their governor and the sovereign protector of their bearers thou art the one my god and my ruler who hast sent down thy book that thou mayest manifest my cause and glorify my word through it thou didst enter into covenant concerning me with all that hath been created in thy realm thou seest beloved of the world how the rebellious among thy creatures have made of that covenant bulwark for themselves and through it have withdrawn from thy beauty and repudiated thy signs thou art he my god who hath commanded them in thy great book and said “fear ye the most merciful people of the bayán and deny not him for whom have ordained the bayán to be one of the leaves of his paradise verily esteem it as gift from me unto him were it his pleasure to accept it he truly is the most bountiful and if he cast it away and refuse to consider it his verdict is just and he in very truth is praiseworthy in his acts and meet to be obeyed in his behests to none is given the right to cavil at him thou beholdest therefore my god how this wronged one hath fallen into the hands of such as have denied thy right and broken off from thy sovereignty he round whose person circleth thy proof and in whose name and on behalf of whose sovereignty thy testimony crieth out unto all created things hath suffered more grievously in his days than any pen can recount and been so harassed that he who is thy spirit jesus lamented and all the denizens of thy kingdom and all the inmates of thy tabernacle in the realms above cried with great and bitter lamentation should any one incline his inner ear he would hear the cry and the wailing of all created things over what hath befallen him whom the world hath wronged at the hands of them with whom thou hast covenanted in the day of separation where is that fair minded soul my god who will judge equitably thy cause and where is the man of insight to be found who will behold thee with thine own eyes is there any man of hearing who will hear thee with thine ears or one endued with eloquence who will speak the truth in thy days swear by thy glory thou who beholdest me from thine all glorious horizon and hearest the voice of the lote tree beyond which there is no passing should any one consider thy books which thou didst name the bayán and ponder in his heart what hath been revealed therein he would discover that each of these books announceth my revelation and declareth my name and testifieth to my self and proclaimeth my cause and my praise and my rising and the radiance of my glory and yet notwithstanding thy proclamation my god and in spite of the words thou didst utter my beloved thou hast seen and heard their calumnies against me and their evil doings in my days testify in my present state my lord and against the will of him who hath turned his back to thee mírzá yaḥyá that thou art god and that there is none other god beside thee this verily is the day wherewith thy scriptures and thy books and thy tablets have been adorned and he who now speaketh is in truth the well guarded treasure and the hidden secret and the preserved tablet and the impenetrable mystery and the sealed book he truly is to be obeyed in whatsoever he commandeth and decreeth and revealeth and is to be loved in everything he through his sovereignty enjoineth and through his power ordaineth whoso will hesitate for less than the twinkling of an eye hath verily denied thy right and repudiated all that thou hast revealed in thy books and in thy scriptures and sent down with thy chosen ones and thy prophets and thy messengers and the trustees of thy revelation beg of thee thou in whose hands are the kingdoms of earth and heaven and in whose grasp lie all who dwell in the dominions of thy revelation and thy creation not to withhold the glance of thy favors from such as have sustained tribulations in thy path and tasted of the cup of woe in their love towards thee and have been cast into prison in thy name and endured what none of thy creatures and thy people have endured they are thy servants my lord who have responded to thee as soon as thou didst send out thy summons and have set their faces towards thee when the light of thy countenance was lifted upon them and turned unto thee at the time when thy most exalted horizon shone forth with the brightness of thy name through which all who are in thy heaven and on thy earth swooned away ordain for them my lord what thou didst ordain for thy chosen ones who have welcomed the darts of the infidels in thy cause and for love of thee and hasted to attain the orient of tribulation with thy name on their lips and thy remembrance in their hearts thou art the one my god who hath promised in thy perspicuous utterances to remember them in thy book as recompense for their works in thy days bless them my god and ascribe unto them such glory as hath shone forth above the horizon of thy will and hath shed its splendors from the kingdom of thine utterance immerse them my lord beneath the ocean of thy mercy and illumine them with the dawning light of thy revelation forgive then my god their fathers and their mothers by thy favor and thy bounty and thy tender mercies send then upon them from the right hand of thy most exalted paradise the fragrance of the robe of thine all glorious beauty potent art thou to do what pleaseth thee thou verily art the governor the ordainer the all bountiful the ever forgiving the most generous praise be unto thee thou the beloved of the world and the adored of the hearts of them that have recognized thee clxxvii beseechthee my god by thy mighty sign and by the revelation of thy grace amongst men to cast me not away

except by thy leave and who forsook all that they possessed in thy path and for love of thee beseech thee my lord by thyself and by thy signs and thy clear tokens and the shining light of the daystar of thy beauty and thy branches to cancel the trespasses of those who have held fast to thy laws and have observed what thou hast prescribed unto them in thy book thou seest me my god holding to thy name the most holy the most luminous the most mighty the most great the most exalted the most glorious and clinging to the hem of the robe to which have clung all in this world and in the world to come clxxviii praisedbe thou lord my god supplicate thee by him whom thou hast called into being whose revelation thou hast ordained to be thine own revelation and his concealment thine own concealment through his firstness thou hast confirmed thine own firstness and through his lastness thou hast affirmed thine own lastness through the power of his might and the influence of his sovereignty the mighty have apprehended thine omnipotence and through his glory they who are endowed with authority have acknowledged thy majesty and greatness through his supreme ascendancy thy transcendent sovereignty and all encompassing dominion have been recognized and through his will thine own will hath been revealed through the light of his countenance the splendors of thine own face have shone forth and through his cause thine own cause hath been made manifest through the generative power of his utterance the whole earth hath been made the recipient of the wondrous signs and tokens of thy sovereignty and the heavens have been filled with the revelations of thine incomparable majesty and the seas have been enriched with the sacred pearls of thine omniscience and wisdom and the trees adorned with the fruits of thy knowledge through him all things have sung thy praise and all the eyes have been turned in the direction of thy mercy through him the faces of all have been set towards the splendors of the light of thy countenance and the souls of all have been inclined unto the revelations of thy divine greatness how great is thy power how exalted thy sovereignty how lofty thy might how excellent thy majesty how supreme is thy grandeur—a grandeur which he who is thy manifestation hath made known and wherewith thou hast invested him as sign of thy generosity and bountiful favor bear witness my god that through him thy most resplendent signs have been uncovered and thy mercy hath encompassed the entire creation but for him how could the celestial dove have uttered its songs or the heavenly nightingale according to the decree of god have warbled its melody testify that no sooner had the first word proceeded through the potency of thy will and purpose out of his mouth and the first call gone forth from his lips than the whole creation was revolutionized and all that are in the heavens and all that are on earth were stirred to the depths through that word the realities of all created things were shaken were divided separated scattered combined and reunited disclosing in both the contingent world and the heavenly kingdom entities of new creation and revealing in the unseen realms the signs and tokens of thy unity and oneness through that call thou didst announce unto all thy servants the advent of thy most great revelation and the appearance of thy most perfect cause no sooner had that revelation been unveiled to men’s eyes than the signs of universal discord appeared among the peoples of the world and commotion seized the dwellers of earth and heaven and the foundations of all things were shaken the forces of dissension were released the meaning of the word was unfolded and every several atom in all created things acquired its own distinct and separate character hell was made to blaze and the delights of paradise were uncovered to men’s eyes blessed is the man that turneth towards thee and woe betide him who standeth aloof from thee who denieth thee and repudiateth thy signs in this revelation wherein the faces of the exponents of denial have turned black and the faces of the exponents of truthfulness have turned white thou who art the possessor of all names and attributes who holdest in thy grasp the empire of whatever hath been created in heaven and on earth praise be to thee therefore my god—such praise as thou didst ascribe to thine own self and which none except thee can either comprehend or reckon thou art he my lord who hath made known his own self unto me at time when thy servants have failed to recognize thee—servants who by virtue of the ties that bind them to thee have been ruling over all that dwell on earth and have been vaunting themselves over its peoples were my god to exercise from pole to pole supreme dominion over the earth and were to be offered all the treasures it containeth and were to expend them in thy path would still be powerless to attain unto this station unless were assisted and strengthened by thee and were to glorify thee my god so long as the glory of thy majesty endureth and the influence of thy sovereignty and power will last such glorification could never be compared with any of the praises which thou as token of thy grace hast taught me and wherewith thou hast bidden me to extol thy virtues if such be the excellence of each one of the praises which thou hast taught me how immeasurably greater must be the excellence of the station of the one who hath known thee who hath entered thy presence and pursued steadfastly the path of thy cause have clearly perceived and am wholly persuaded that thou hast from everlasting been immeasurably exalted above the mention of all beings and wilt continue unto everlasting to remain far above the conception of thy creatures none can befittingly praise thee except thine own self and such as are like unto thee thou hast verily been at all times and wilt everlastingly continue to remain immensely exalted beyond and above all comparison and likeness above all imagination of parity or resemblance having thus recognized thee as one who is incomparable and whose nature none can possess it becometh incontrovertibly evident that whosoever may praise thee his praise can befit only such as are of his own nature and are subject to his own limitations and it can in no wise adequately describe the sublimity of thy sovereignty nor scale the heights of thy majesty and holiness how sweet therefore is the praise thou givest to thine own self and the description thou givest of thine own being testify my god that thou hast from eternity sent down upon thy servants naught else except that which can cause them to soar up and be drawn near unto thee and to ascend into the heaven of thy transcendent oneness thou hast established thy bounds among them and ordained them to stand among thy creatures as evidences of thy justice and as signs of thy mercy and to be the stronghold of thy protection amongst thy people that no man may in thy realm transgress against his neighbor how great is the blessedness of him who for love of thy beauty and for the sake of thy pleasure hath curbed the desires of corrupt inclination and observed the precepts laid down by thy most exalted pen he in truth is to be numbered with them that have attained unto all good and followed the way of guidance beseech thee my lord by thy name through which thou hast enabled thy servants and thy people to know thee through which thou hast drawn the hearts of those who have recognized thee towards the resplendent court of thy oneness and the souls of thy favored ones unto the dayspring of thy unity —i beseech thee to grant that may be assisted to observe the fast wholly for thy sake thou who art full of majesty and glory empower me then my god to be reckoned among them that have clung to thy laws and precepts for the sake of thee alone their eyes fixed on thy face these indeed are they whose wine is all that hath proceeded out of the mouth of thy primal will whose pure beverage is thine enthralling call whose heavenly river is thy love whose paradise is entrance into thy presence and reunion with thee for thou hast been their beginning and their end and their highest hope and their supreme desire blinded be the eye that gazeth on whatsoever may displease thee and confounded be the soul that seeketh the things that are contrary to thy will deign my god implore thee by thy self and by them to accept through thy grace and thy loving kindness the works we have performed however much they fall short of the loftiness of thy state and the sublimity of thy station thou who art most dear to the hearts that long for thee and the healer of the souls that have recognized thee rain down therefore upon us from the heaven of thy mercy and the clouds of thy gracious providence that which will cleanse us from the faintest trace of evil and corrupt desires and will draw us nearer unto him who is the manifestation of thy most exalted and all glorious self thou art verily the lord of this world and of the next and art powerful to do all things do thou bless lord my god the primal point through whom the point of creation hath been made to revolve in both the visible and invisible worlds whom thou hast designated as the one whereunto should return whatsoever must return unto thee and as the revealer of whatsoever may be manifested by thee do thou also bless such of his letters as have not turned away from thee who have been firmly established in thy love and clung steadfastly to thy good pleasure bless thou likewise as long as thine own self endureth and thine own essence doth last them that have suffered martyrdom in thy path thou art verily the ever forgiving the most merciful moreover beseech thee my god by him whom thou hast announced unto us in all thy tablets and thy books and thy scrolls and thy scriptures through whom the kingdom of names hath been convulsed and all that lay hid in the breasts of them that have followed their evil and corrupt desires hath been revealed —i beseech thee to strengthen us in our love for him to make us steadfast in his cause to help us befriend his loved ones and challenge his enemies shield us then my god from the mischief wrought by them that have denied thy presence and turned away from thy face and resolved to put an end to the life of him who is the manifestation of thine own self my god and my master thou knowest how they have disgraced thy cause and dishonored thee among thy creatures how they have joined thine enemies that they may undermine thy revelation and injure thee lay hold on them with the power of thy wrath and might my god and expose their shameful acts and their wickedness that whatever is hid in their breasts may be revealed unto the people that dwell within thy land thou who art the inflictor of trials the fashioner of nations and the bestower of favors no god is there beside thee the all glorious the most bountiful clxxix praisedbe thou lord my god the tongues of all created things testify to thy sovereignty and thine omnipotence and proclaim mine own poverty and my wretchedness when face to face with the revelations of thy wealth look then my god upon this sinner whose gaze hath at all times been fixed upon the source of thy forgiveness and whose eyes have been bent upon the horizon of thy grace and thy gifts ever since the day thou didst create me at thy bidding my god and didst arouse me through the gentle winds of thy tender mercies have refused to turn to any one except thee and have through the power of thy sovereignty and thy might arisen to face thine enemies and have summoned all mankind unto the shores of the ocean of thy oneness and the heaven of thine all glorious unity have sought all my days not to guard myself from the mischief of the rebellious among thy creatures but rather to exalt thy name amidst thy people have thereby suffered what none of thy creatures hath suffered how many the days my god which have spent in utter loneliness with the transgressors amongst thy servants and how many the nights my best beloved during which lay captive in the hands of the wayward amidst thy creatures in the midst of my troubles and tribulations have continued to celebrate thy praise before all who are in thy heaven and on thy earth and have not ceased to extol thy wondrous glory in the kingdoms of thy revelation and of thy creation though all that have been capable of showing forth hath fallen short of the greatness and the majesty of thy oneness and is unworthy of thine exaltation and of thine omnipotence swear by thy glory thou who art the one alone beloved find myself to be only nothing before the habitation of thy great glory every time attempt to extol any one of thy virtues my heart restraineth me for naught but thee is able to soar into the atmosphere of the kingdom of thy nearness or reach up to the heaven of thy presence thy might beareth me witness am well aware that were to bow myself before handful of dust from now until the end that hath no end in acknowledgment of its relationship to thy name the fashioner would still find myself far removed from that dust and incapable of approaching it and would discover that such an adoration can in no wise befit it nor transcend the limitations to which myself have been subjected and were to arise to serve one of thy servants and to wait at his door so long as thine own kingdom endureth and thine omnipotence will last as sign of my acknowledgment of the tie that bindeth him to thy name the creator would likewise —and to this thy glory beareth me witness—have to confess my complete failure to do him adequate service and my deprivation of what can truly befit his station and this for the reason that recognize in them naught else except the bond that bindeth them to thy names and thine attributes how can then such man succeed in befittingly extolling the one through motion of whose finger all the names and their kingdom were called into being and all the attributes and their dominion were created and who through yet another motion of that same finger hath united the letters and be and knit them together manifesting thereby what the highest thoughts of thy chosen ones who enjoy near access to thee are unable to grasp and what the profoundest wisdom of those of thy loved ones that are wholly devoted to thee are powerless to fathom swear by thy glory beloved of my soul am bewildered when contemplate the tokens of thy handiwork and the evidences of thy might and find myself completely unable to unravel the mystery of the least of thy signs how much more to apprehend thine own self beseech thee therefore my god by thy name through which thou hast caused all such as love thee to soar in the atmosphere of thy will and hast guided all them that yearn after thee into the paradise of thy nearness and thy presence to waft from the heaven of thy loving kindness the fragrance of certainty upon the needy among thy loved ones in these days when the tempests of trials have compassed them on every side and so grievously assailed them that the souls of men have been troubled and the foundations of all beings have trembled at what hath been sent down unto them from the heaven of thine irrevocable purpose they were so shaken that the lamp of their love for thee and of their remembrance of thee was ready to be extinguished in the recess of their hearts powerful art thou to do what pleaseth thee thou in truth art the ever forgiving the most generous thou givest ear my god and my master to the sighing of them that are dear to thee and hearest from all sides their cry by reason of what hath befallen them at the hands of those whose hearts have been deprived of the sweet savors of thy love there is none either to befriend or to succor them nor can anything deter their enemies from harming them unrestrained they do what they wish and deal with them as they please give therefore my lord the wonders of thine aid to thy loved ones who have sought no helper except thee and have turned to none save thyself and whose eyes have expectantly awaited to behold the wonders of thy favors and thy gifts have pity then upon them my god through the incomparable tokens of thy mercy and shelter them within the stronghold of thy protection and thy loving kindness thou art the one my lord who from everlasting hath been the refuge of the fearful and the haven of the needy withhold not beseech thee from these feeble creatures the matchless tokens of thy bounteousness and generosity and leave them not to the mercy of them whose essence hath been solely created of the fire of thy wrath and of thine anger and who have never discovered the fragrance of compassion and equity and who have been so deluded by the deceitfulness of the world that they have denied thy proof and joined partners with thee and repudiated thy signs and shed the blood of those who are dear to thee and have been trusted by thee swear by thy might my beloved they have committed what no man before them hath committed and have thereby deserved thy wrath and the scourge of thine anger lay hold on them by the power of thy sovereignty and set over them such as will have no mercy upon them unless they return unto thee and enter beneath the shadow of thy loving kindness and are forgiven by thee thou hast from everlasting been supreme over all things and wilt unto everlasting remain the same thou truly art the almighty the most exalted the equitable the all wise glorified art thou lord my god look thou upon this wronged one who hath been sorely afflicted by the oppressors among thy creatures and the infidels among thine enemies though he himself hath refused to breathe single breath but by thy leave and at thy bidding lay asleep on my couch my god when lo the gentle winds of thy grace and thy loving kindness passed over me and wakened me through the power of thy sovereignty and thy gifts and bade me arise before thy servants and speak forth thy praise and glorify thy word thereupon most of thy people reviled me swear by thy glory my god never thought that they would show forth such deeds aware as am that thou hast thyself announced this revelation unto them in the scrolls of thy commandment and the tablets of thy decree and hast covenanted with them concerning this youth in every word sent down by thee unto thy creatures and thy people am bewildered therefore my god and know not how to act toward them every time hold my peace and cease to extol thy wondrous virtues thy spirit impelleth me to cry out before all who are in thy heaven and on thy earth and every time am still the breaths wafted from the right hand of thy will and purpose pass over me and stir me up and find myself to be as leaf which lieth at the mercy of the winds of thy decree and is carried away whithersoever thou dost permit or command it every man of insight who considereth what hath been revealed by me will be persuaded that thy cause is not in my hands but in thy hands and will recognize that the reins of power are held not in my grasp but in thy grasp and are subject to thy sovereign might and yet thou seest my god how the inhabitants of thy realm have arrayed themselves against me and inflict upon me every moment of my life what causeth the realities of thy chosen ones and trusted ones to tremble entreat thee therefore my god by thy name through which thou hast guided thy lovers to the living waters of thy grace and thy favors and attracted them that long for thee to the paradise of thy nearness and thy presence to open the eyes of thy people that they may recognize in this revelation the manifestation of thy transcendent unity and the dawning of the lights of thy countenance and thy beauty cleanse them then my god from all idle fancies and vain imaginations that they may inhale the fragrances of sanctity from the robe of thy revelation and thy commandment that haply they may cease to inflict upon me what will deprive their souls of the fragrances of the manifold tokens of thy mercy that are wafted in the days of him who is the manifestation of thyself and the dayspring of thy cause and that they may not perpetrate what will call down thy wrath and anger thou well knowest my god that was regarded as one of the people of the bayán and consorted with them with love and fellowship and summoned them to thee in the daytime and in the night season through the wonders of thy revelation and thine inspiration and sustained at their hands what the inmates of the cities of thine invention are powerless to recount swear by thy might my beloved every morning waken to find that am made target for the darts of their envy and every night when lie down to rest discover that have fallen victim to the spears of their hate though thou hast made known unto me the secrets of their hearts and hast set me above them have refused to uncover their deeds and have dealt patiently with them mindful of the time which thou hast fixed and when thy promise came to pass and the set time was fulfilled thou didst lift to an imperceptible degree the veil of concealment and lo all the inmates of the kingdoms of thy revelation and of thy creation shook and trembled except those who were created by thee through the fire of thy love and the breath of thine eagerness and the water of thy loving kindness and the clay of thy grace these are they who are glorified by the concourse on high and the denizens of the cities of eternity give praise to thee therefore my god that thou hast preserved them that have acknowledged thy unity and hast destroyed them that have joined partners with thee and hast divided the one from the other through yet another word that hath proceeded out of the mouth of thy will and flowed down from the pen of thy purpose thereby have thy servants who were created through the word of thy commandment and were begotten by thy will caviled at me and so fiercely opposed me that they repudiated thee and have rejected thy signs and have risen up against thee thy glory beareth me witness my beloved my pen is powerless to describe what their hands have wrought against him who is the manifestation of thy cause and the dayspring of thy revelation and the dawning place of thine inspiration for all this give praise to thee swear by thy glory my god my heart yearneth after the things ordained by thee in the heaven of thy decree and the kingdom of thine appointment for whatsoever befalleth me in thy path is the beloved of my soul and the goal of my desire this verily is to be ascribed to naught except thy power and

nothing but the revelation of thine own merciful self that the earth and all that is therein may be cleansed of whatever is alien to thee or anything that manifesteth aught save thy self all this can be fulfilled throughout thy dominion by thy word of command “be and it is nay even swifter than this and yet the people understand not glorified immeasurably glorified art thou my beloved swear by thy glory recognize this very moment that thou hast granted all for which have supplicated thee in this blessed night which as decreed by thee calleth to remembrance him who was the companion of thy beauty and the beholder of thy face ere had been mentioned by thee or called into being within the court of thy holiness perceive that thou hast made all things to be the manifestations of thy behest and the revelations of thy handiwork and the repositories of thy knowledge and the treasuries of thy wisdom recognize moreover that were any of the revelations of thy names and thine attributes to be withheld though it be the weight of grain of mustard seed from whatsoever hath been created by thy power and begotten by thy might the foundations of thine everlasting handiwork would thereby be made incomplete and the gems of thy divine wisdom would become imperfect for the letters of negation no matter how far they may be removed from the holy fragrances of thy knowledge and however forgetful they may become of the wondrous splendors of the dawning light of thy beauty which are shed from the heaven of thy majesty must needs exist in thy realm so that the words which affirm thee may thereby be exalted thy might beareth me witness my well beloved the entire creation hath been called into being to exalt thy triumph and to establish thine ascendancy and all the bounds that have been set by thee are but the signs of thy sovereignty and proclaim the power of thy might how great how very great are the revelations of thy wondrous power in all things they are such that the lowliest among thy creatures hath been made by thee manifestation of thy most august attribute and the most contemptible token of thy handiwork hath been chosen as recipient of thy most mighty name poverty as decreed by thee hath been made the means for the revelation of thy riches and abasement path leading to thy glory and sinfulness cause for the exercise of thy forgiveness by them thou hast demonstrated that to thee belong thy most excellent titles and unto thee pertain the wonders of thy most exalted attributes since thou hast purposed my god to cause all created things to enter into the tabernacle of thy transcendent grace and favor and to waft over the entire creation the fragrances of the raiment of thy glorious unity and to look upon all things with the eyes of thy bounty and thy oneness beseech thee therefore by thy love which thou hast made to be the mainspring of the revelations of thine eternal holiness and the flame that gloweth within the hearts of such of thy creatures as yearn towards thee to create this very moment for those of thy people who are wholly devoted to thee and for such of thy loved ones as love thee out of the essence of thy bounty and thy generosity and from the inmost spirit of thy grace and thy glory thy paradise of transcendent holiness and to exalt it above everything except thee and to sanctify it from aught else save thyself create moreover within it my god out of the lights shed by thy throne handmaidens who will intone the melodies of thy wondrous and most sweet invention that they may magnify thy name with such words as have not been heard by any of thy creatures be they the inmates of thy heaven or the dwellers of thine earth nor been comprehended by any of thy people unlock then the gates of this paradise to the faces of thy loved ones that haply they may enter them in thy name and by the power of thy sovereignty that thereby the sovereign bounties vouchsafed by thee unto thy chosen ones and the transcendent gifts granted unto thy trusted ones be perfected that they may extol thy virtues with such melodies as none can either intone or describe and that none of thy people may conceive the design of appearing in the guise of any of thy chosen ones or of emulating the example of thy loved ones and that none may fail to discern between thy friends and thine enemies or to distinguish them that are devoted to thee from such as

creatures however learned to know thee exalted immensely exalted art thou above every human attempt no matter how searching to describe thee for the highest thought of men however deep their

continual trials and the successive tribulations and the incessant afflictions which have been sent down upon thine elect such hath been their plight that the earth became too strait for them and they were encompassed by the evidences of thy wrath and the signs of thy fear in every land and the doors of thy mercy and thy loving kindness were shut against them and the garden of their hearts was deprived of the overflowing showers of thy grace and thy bountiful favors wilt thou withhold my god from such as love thee the wonders of thine ascendancy and triumph wilt thou shatter my beloved the hopes which they who are devoted to thee have fixed on thy manifold bounties and gifts wilt thou keep back my master those that have recognized thee from the shores of thy sanctified knowledge or wilt thou cease to rain down upon the hearts of such as desire thee the showers of thy transcendent grace no no and to this thy glory beareth me witness testify this very moment that thy mercy hath surpassed all created things and thy loving kindness encompassed all that are in heaven and all that are on earth from everlasting the doors of thy generosity were open to the faces of thy servants and the gentle winds of thy grace were wafted over the hearts of thy creatures and the overflowing rains of thy bounty were showered upon thy people and the dwellers of thy realm know full well thou hast delayed to manifest thy triumph in the kingdom of creation by reason of thy knowledge which embraceth both the mysteries of thy decree and the hidden things ordained behind the veils of thine irrevocable purpose that thereby those who have entered beneath the shadow of thy transcendent mercy may be separated from those who have dealt disdainfully with thee and turned back from thy presence at the time when thou didst manifest thy most exalted beauty exalted immeasurably exalted art thou therefore my beloved forasmuch as thou hast divided in thy realm thy loved ones from thine enemies and hast perfected thy most weighty testimony and thy most infallible proof unto all who are in heaven and on earth have mercy then upon those who were brought low in thy land by reason of what hath befallen them in thy path exalt them then my god through the power of thy might and the potency of thy will and raise them up to proclaim thy cause through thine omnipotent sovereignty and purpose swear by thy glory my sole purpose in showing forth thine ascendancy hath been to glorify thy cause and to magnify thy word am persuaded that if thou wert to delay to send down thy victory and to demonstrate thy power the signs of thy sovereignty would assuredly perish in thy land and the tokens of thy rule would be blotted out throughout thy dominion my breast is straitened my god and sorrows and vexations have compassed me round for hear among thy servants every praise except thy wondrous praise and behold amidst thy people the evidences of all things save the evidences of what thou hast prescribed unto them by thy behest and destined for them through thy sovereign will and ordained unto them by thine overruling decree they have strayed so far from thee that should any of thy loved ones deliver unto them the wondrous tokens of thy unity and the gem like utterances that attest thy transcendent oneness they would thrust their fingers into their ears and would cavil at him and mock him all this hast thou set down through thine all encompassing sovereignty and apprehended through thine omnipotent supremacy glorified immeasurably glorified art thou my master look then upon the hearts which in their love for thee have been transfixed by the darts of thine enemies and the heads which were borne on spears for the sake of the exaltation of thy cause and the glorification of thy name have pity then upon those hearts which have been consumed by the fire of thy love and been touched by such tribulations as are known only unto thee all laud and honor to thee my god thou well knowest the things which for score of years have happened in thy days and have continued to happen until this hour no man can reckon nor can any tongue tell what hath befallen thy chosen ones during all this time they could obtain no shelter nor find any refuge in which they could abide in safety turn then my god their fear into the evidences of thy peace and thy security and their abasement into the sovereignty of thy glory and their poverty into thine all sufficient riches and their distress into the wonders of thy perfect tranquility vouchsafe unto them the fragrances of thy might and thy mercy and send down upon them out of thy marvelous loving kindness what will enable them to dispense with all except thee and will detach them from aught save thyself that the sovereignty of thy oneness may be revealed and the supremacy of thy grace and thy bounty demonstrated wilt thou not my god look upon the tears which thy loved ones have shed wilt thou not pity my beloved the eyes which have been dimmed by reason of their separation from thee and because of the cessation of the signs of thy victory wilt thou not behold my master the hearts wherein have beaten the wings of the dove of longing and love for thee by thy glory things have come to such pass that hope hath well nigh been banished from the hearts of thy chosen ones and the breaths of despair are ready to seize them by reason of what hath befallen them in thy days behold me then my god how have fled from myself unto thee and have abandoned my own being that may attain unto the splendors of the light of thy being and have forsaken all that keepeth me back from thee and maketh me forgetful of thee in order that may inhale the fragrances of thy presence and thy remembrance behold how have stepped upon the dust of the city of thy forgiveness and thy bounty and dwelt within the precincts of thy transcendent mercy and have besought thee through the sovereignty of him who is thy remembrance and who hath appeared in the robe of thy most pure and most august beauty to send down in the course of this year upon thy loved ones what will enable them to dispense with any one except thee and will set them free to recognize the evidences of thy sovereign will and all conquering purpose in such wise that they will seek only what thou didst wish for them through thy bidding and will desire naught except what thou didst desire for them through thy will sanctify then their eyes my god that they may behold the light of thy beauty and purge their ears that they may listen to the melodies of the dove of thy transcendent oneness flood then their hearts with the wonders of thy love and preserve their tongues from mentioning any one save thee and guard their faces from turning to aught else except thyself potent art thou to do what pleaseth thee thou verily art the almighty the help in peril the self subsisting protect moreover my beloved through thy love for them and through the love they bear to thee this servant who hath sacrificed his all for thee and expended whatsoever thou hast given him in the path of thy love and thy good pleasure and preserve him from all that thou abhorrest and from whatsoever may hinder him from entering into the tabernacle of thy holy sovereignty and from attaining the seat of thy transcendent oneness number him then my god with such as have allowed nothing whatever to deter them from beholding thy beauty or from meditating on the wondrous evidences of thine everlasting handiwork that he may have fellowship with none except thee and turn to naught save thyself and discover in whatever hath been created by thee in the kingdoms of earth and heaven nothing but thy wondrous beauty and the revelation of the splendors of thy face and be so immersed beneath the billowing oceans of thine overruling providence and the surging seas of thy holy unity that he will forget every mention except the mention of thy transcendent oneness and banish from his soul the traces of all evil suggestions thou in whose hands are the kingdoms of all names and attributes lauded be thy name thou who art the goal of my desire swear by thy glory how great is my wish to attain unto detachment so complete that were there to appear before me those countenances which are hid within the chambers of chastity and the beauty of which thou didst veil from the eyes of the entire creation and whose faces thou didst sanctify from the sight of all beings and were they to unveil themselves in all the glory of the splendors of thine incomparable beauty would refuse to look upon them and would behold them solely for the purpose of discerning the mysteries of thy handiwork which have perplexed the minds of such as have drawn nigh unto thee and awed the souls of all them that have recognized thee would by thy power and thy might soar to such heights that nothing whatsoever would have the power to keep me back from the manifold evidences of thy transcendent dominion nor would any earthly scheme shut me out from the manifestations of thy divine holiness glorified immeasurably glorified art thou my god and my beloved and my master and my desire shatter not the hopes of this lowly one to attain the shores of thy glory and deprive not this wretched creature of the immensities of thy riches and cast not away this suppliant from the doors of thy grace and thy bounty and thy gifts have mercy then upon this poor and desolate soul who hath sought no friend but thee and no companion except thee and no comforter save thee and no beloved apart from thee nor cherished any desire but thyself cast then upon me my god the glances of thy mercy and forgive me my trespasses and the trespasses of them that are dear to thee and which come in between us and the revelation of thy triumph and thy grace cancel thou moreover our sins which have shut off our faces from the splendors of the daystar of thy favors powerful art thou to do thy pleasure thou ordainest

there save thee the almighty the most powerful the ever living the most compassionate this document has been downloaded from thebahá’í reference library you are free to use its content subject to the terms of use found atwww bahai org legal tablets of bahá’u’lláh súriy haykal súrih of the temple the years following bahá’u’lláh’s arrival in adrianople witnessed his revelation’s attainment in the words of shoghi effendi of “its meridian glory” through the proclamation of its founder’s message to the kings and rulers of the world during this relatively brief but turbulent period of the faith’s history and in the early years of his subsequent exile in to the fortress town of ‘akká he summoned the monarchs of east and west collectively and some among them individually to recognize the day of god and to acknowledge the one promised in the scriptures of the religions professed by the recipients of his summons “never since the beginning of the world” bahá’u’lláh declares “hath the message been so openly proclaimed the present volume brings together the first full authorized english translation of these major writings among them is the complete súriy haykal the súrih of the temple one of bahá’u’lláh’s most challenging works it was originally revealed during his banishment to adrianople and later recast after his arrival in ‘akká in this version he incorporated his messages addressed to individual potentates—pope pius ix napoleon iii czar alexander ii queen victoria and náṣiri’d dínsháh it was this composite work which shortly after its completion bahá’u’lláh instructed be written in the form of pentacle symbolizing the human temple to it he added as conclusion what shoghi effendi has described as “words which reveal the importance he attached to those messages and indicate their direct association with the prophecies of the old testament” thus have we built the temple with the hands of power and might could ye but know it this is the temple promised unto you in the book draw ye nigh unto it this is that which profiteth you could ye but comprehend it be fair peoples of the earth which is preferable this or temple which is built of clay set your faces towards it thus have ye been commanded by god the help in peril the self subsisting during the last years of his ministry bahá’u’lláh himself arranged for the publication for the first time of definitive versions of some of his principal works and the súriy haykal was awarded prominent position among them of the various writings that make up the súriy haykal one requires particular mention the lawḥ sulṭán the tablet to náṣiri’d dínsháh bahá’u’lláh’s lengthiest epistle to any single sovereign was revealed in the weeks immediately preceding his final banishment to ‘akká it was eventually delivered to the monarch by badí‘ youth of seventeen who had entreated bahá’u’lláh for the honour of rendering some service his efforts won him the crown of martyrdom and immortalized his name the tablet contains the celebrated passage describing the circumstances in which the divine call was communicated to bahá’u’lláh and the effect it produced here too we find his unequivocal offer to meet with the muslim clergy in the presence of thesháh and to provide whatever proofs of the new revelation they might consider to be definitive test of spiritual integrity significantly failed by those who claimed to be the authoritative trustees of the message of the qur’án included in this collection as well is the first full translation of the súriy mulúk or súrih of the kings which shoghi effendi described as “the most momentous tablet revealed by bahá’u’lláh in which he for the first time directs his words collectively to the entire company of the monarchs of east and west” it sets forth both the character of his mission and the standard of justice that must govern the exercise of their rule in this day of god lay not aside the fear of god kings of the earth and beware that ye transgress not the bounds which the almighty hath fixed observe the injunctions laid upon you in his book and take good heed not to overstep their limits be vigilant that ye may not do injustice to anyone be it to the extent of grain of mustard seed tread ye the path of justice for this verily is the straight path the tablet introduces some of the great themes that were to figure prominently in the writings of bahá’u’lláh over the next two and half decades the obligation of those into whose hands god has entrusted civil authority to institute the reign of justice the necessity for the reduction of armaments and the resolution of conflicts among nations and an end to the excessive expenditures that were impoverishing these rulers’ subjects surveying the principal contents of bahá’u’lláh’s majestic call to the kings and rulers of the world shoghi effendi has written the magnitude and diversity of the theme the cogency of the argument the sublimity and audacity of the language arrest our attention and astound our minds emperors kings and princes chancellors and ministers the pope himself priests monks and philosophers the exponents of learning parliamentarians and deputies the rich ones of the earth the followers of all religions and the people of bahá—all are brought within the purview of the author of these messages and receive each according to their merits the counsels and admonitions they deserve no less amazing is the diversity of the subjects touched upon in these tablets the transcendent majesty and unity of an unknowable and unapproachable god is extolled and the oneness of his messengers proclaimed and emphasized the uniqueness the universality and potentialities of the bahá’í faith are stressed and the purpose and character of the bábí revelation unfolded the summary draws attention to bahá’u’lláh’s uncompromising indictment of the conditions of human society for which its leadership is held primarily responsible episodes at once moving and marvellous at various stages of his ministry are recounted and the transitoriness of worldly pomp fame riches and sovereignty repeatedly and categorically asserted appeals for the application of the highest principles in human and international relations are forcibly and insistently made and the abandonment of discreditable practices and conventions detrimental to the happiness the growth the prosperity and the unity of the human race enjoined kings are censured ecclesiastical dignitaries arraigned ministers and plenipotentiaries condemned and the identification of his advent with the coming of the father himself unequivocally admitted and repeatedly announced the violent downfall of few of these kings and emperors is prophesied two of them are definitely challenged most are warned all are appealed to and exhorted in tablet the original of which has been lost bahá’u’lláh had already condemned in the severest terms the misrule of the ottoman sulṭán ‘abdu’l ‘azíz the present volume includes however three other tablets which address two ministers of the sulṭán whose selfish and unprincipled influence played an important role in bahá’u’lláh’s successive banishments the súriy ra’ís which addresses ‘álí páshá the ottoman prime minister was revealed in august as the exiles were being moved from adrianople to gallipoli and exposes unsparingly the abuse of civil power the minister had perpetrated the lawḥ ra’ís which also contains passages directed to ‘álí páshá was revealed shortly after bahá’u’lláh’s incarceration in the citadel of ‘akká and includes chilling denunciation of the character of the minister the third tablet the lawḥ fu’ád revealed in shortly after the death of fu’ád páshá the ottoman minister to whose machinations it refers describes the spiritual consequences of the abuse of power and foretells the imminent downfall of his colleague ‘álí páshá and the overthrow of the sulṭán himself—prophecies that were widely circulated and whose dramatic fulfilment added greatly to the prestige of their author it seems especially appropriate as bahá’u’lláh’s influence penetrates ever more deeply the life of the larger society throughout the world that the full texts of these great tablets should now be available for broad readership we express to the committees who were commissioned to undertake and review these translations the deep gratitude we feel for the care and sensitivity they have brought to the task bahá’ís will recognize key passages from several of the tablets that were introduced to the west by shoghi effendi his translations into english of the bahá’í holy texts provide an enduring standard for the efforts of those who rise to the challenge of preparing appropriate renderings into english of these treasures of the faith the universal house of justice he is the most wondrous the all glorious glorifiedis he who hath revealed his verses to those who understand glorified is he who revealeth his verses to those who perceive glorified is he who guideth whomsoever he pleaseth unto his path say verily am the path of god unto all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth well is it with them that hasten thereunto glorified is he who

whatsoever he desireth through his irresistible and inscrutable command blessed is he who aideth whomsoever he desireth with the hosts of the unseen his might is in truth equal to his purpose and he

pleasure well is it with them that understand blessed is he who in well guarded tablet hath prescribed fixed measure unto all things blessed is he who hath revealed unto his servant that which shall illumine the hearts and minds of men blessed is he who hath sent down upon his servant such tribulations as have melted the hearts of them that dwell within the tabernacle of eternity and the souls of those who have drawn nigh unto their lord blessed is he who hath showered upon his servant from the clouds of his decree the darts of affliction and who beholdeth me enduring them with patience and fortitude blessed is he who hath ordained for his servant that which he hath destined for no other soul he verily is the one the incomparable the self subsisting blessed is he who hath caused to rain down upon his servant from the clouds of enmity and at the hands of the people of denial the shafts of tribulation and trial and yet seeth our heart filled with gratitude blessed is he who hath laid upon the shoulders of his servant the burden of the heavens and of the earth—a burden for which we yield him every praise though none may grasp this save them that are endued with understanding glorified is he who hath surrendered the embodiment of his beauty to the clutches of the envious and the wicked—a fate unto which we are fully resigned though none may perceive this save those who are endued with insight glorified is he who hath left ḥusayn to make his dwelling amidst the hosts of his enemies and exposed his body with every breath to the spears of hatred and anger yet do we yield him thanks for all that he hath destined to befall his servant who repaireth unto him in his affliction and grief while engulfed in tribulations heard most wondrous most sweet voice calling above my head turning my face beheld maiden—the embodiment of the remembrance of the name of my lord—suspended in the air before me so rejoiced was she in her very soul that her countenance shone with the ornament of the good pleasure of god and her cheeks glowed with the brightness of the all merciful betwixt earth and heaven she was raising call which captivated the hearts and minds of men she was imparting to both my inward and outer being tidings which rejoiced my soul and the souls of god’s honoured servants pointing with her finger unto my head she addressed all who are in heaven and all who are on earth saying by god this is the best beloved of the worlds and yet ye comprehend not this is the beauty of god amongst you and the power of his sovereignty within you could ye but understand this is the mystery of god and his treasure the cause of god and his glory unto all who are in the kingdoms of revelation and of creation if ye be of them that perceive this is he whose presence is the ardent desire of the denizens of the realm of eternity and of them that dwell within the tabernacle of glory and yet from his beauty do ye turn aside people of the bayán if ye aid him not god will assuredly assist him with the powers of earth and heaven and sustain him with the hosts of the unseen through his command “be” and it is the day is approaching when god will have by an act of his will raised up race of men the nature of which is inscrutable to all save god the all powerful the self subsisting he shall purify them from the defilement of idle fancies and corrupt desires shall lift them up to the heights of holiness and shall cause them to manifest the signs of his sovereignty and might upon earth thus hath it been ordained by god the all glorious the all loving people of the bayán would ye deny him whose presence is the very object of your creation while ye rejoice idly upon your couches would ye laugh to scorn and contend with him single hair of whose head excelleth in the sight of god all that are in the heavens and all that are on the earth people of the bayán produce then that which ye possess that may know by what proof ye believed aforetime in the manifestations of his cause and by what reason ye now wax so disdainful swear by him who hath fashioned me from the light of his own beauty none have ever seen that surpasseth you in heedlessness or exceedeth you in blindness ye seek to prove your faith in god through such holy tablets as ye possess yet when the verses of god were revealed and his lamp was lighted ye disbelieved in him whose very pen hath fixed the destinies of all things in the preserved tablet ye recite the sacred verses and yet repudiate him who is their source and revealer thus hath god blinded your eyes in requital for your deeds would ye but understand day and night ye transcribe the verses of god and yet ye remain shut out as by veil from him who hath revealed them in this day the concourse on high beholdeth you in your evil doings and shunneth your company and yet ye perceive it not they ask of one another “what words do these fools utter and in what valley are they wont to graze do they deny that whereunto their very souls testify and shut their eyes to that which they plainly behold swear by god people they that inhabit the cities of the names of god are bewildered at your actions while ye roam aimless and unconscious in parched and barren land pen of the most high hearken unto the call of thy lord raised from the divine lote tree in the holy and luminous spot that the sweet accents of thy lord the all merciful may fill thy soul with joy and fervour and that the breezes that waft from my name the ever forgiving may dispel thy cares and sorrows raise up then from this temple the temples of the oneness of god that they may tell out in the kingdom of creation the tidings of their lord the most exalted the all glorious and be of them that are illumined by his light we verily have ordained this temple to be the source of all existence in the new creation that all may know of certainty my power to accomplish that which have purposed through my word “be” and it is beneath the shadow of every letter of this temple we shall raise up people whose number none can reckon save god the help in peril the self subsisting erelong shall god bring forth from his temple such souls as will remain unswayed by the insinuations of the rebellious and who will quaff at all times of the cup that is life indeed these truly are of the blissful these are servants who abide beneath the shelter of the tender mercy of their lord and who remain undeterred by those who seek to obstruct their path upon their faces may be seen the brightness of the light of the all merciful and from their hearts may be heard the remembrance of mine all glorious and inaccessible name were they to unloose their tongues to extol their lord the denizens of earth and heaven would join in their anthems of praise—yet how few are they who hear and were they to glorify their lord all created things would join in their hymns of glory thus hath god exalted them above the rest of his creation and yet the people remain unaware these are they who circle round the cause of god even as the shadow doth revolve around the sun open then your eyes people of the bayán that haply ye may behold them it is by virtue of their movement that all things are set in motion and by reason of their stillness all things are brought to rest would that ye might be assured thereof through them the believers in the divine unity have turned towards him who is the object of the adoration of the entire creation and by them the hearts of the righteous have found rest and composure could ye but know it through them the earth hath been established the clouds have rained down their bounty and the bread of holiness hath descended from the heaven of grace could ye but perceive it these souls are the protectors of the cause of god on earth who shall preserve its beauty from the obscuring dust stirred up by every rejected disbeliever in the path of their lord they shall not fear for their lives rather will they sacrifice their all in their eagerness to behold the face of their well beloved and his exaltation in this name the almighty the all powerful the all glorious the most holy living temple arise by the power of thy self in such wise that all created things will be moved to arise with thee aid then thy lord through such ascendancy and might as we have bestowed upon thee take heed lest thou falter on that day when all created things are filled with dismay rather be thou the revealer of my name the self subsisting assist thy lord to the utmost of thine ability and pay no heed to the peoples of the world for that which their mouths utter is like unto the droning of gnat in an endless valley quaff the water of life in my name the all merciful and proffer unto the near ones amongst the inmates of this heavenly garden that which shall cause them to become detached from all names and enter beneath this blessed and all encompassing shadow living temple through thee have we gathered together all created things whether in the heavens or on the earth and called them to account for that which we had covenanted with them before the foundation of the world and lo but for few radiant faces and eloquent tongues we found most of the people dumbfounded their eyes staring up in fear from the former we brought forth the creation of all that hath been and all that shall be these are they whose countenances god hath graciously turned away from the face of the unbelievers and whom he hath sheltered beneath the shadow of the tree of his own being they upon whose hearts he hath bestowed the gift of peace and tranquillity and whom he hath strengthened and assisted through the hosts of the seen and the unseen eyes of this temple look not upon the heavens and that which they contain nor upon the earth and them that dwell thereon for we have created you to behold our own beauty see it now before you withhold not your gaze therefrom and deprive not yourselves of the beauty of your lord the all glorious the best beloved erelong shall we bring into being through you keen and penetrating eyes that will contemplate the manifold signs of their creator and turn away from all that is perceived by the people of the world through you shall we bestow the power of vision upon whomsoever we desire and lay hold upon those who have deprived themselves of this gracious bounty these verily have drunk from the cup of delusion though they perceive it not ears of this temple purge yourselves from all idle clamour and hearken unto the melodies of your lord he verily revealeth unto you from the throne of glory that there is none other god save me the all glorious the almighty the help in peril the self subsisting erelong shall we bring into being through you pure and undefiled ears which will heed the word of god and that which hath appeared from the dayspring of the utterance of your lord the all merciful they shall assuredly perceive the sweet accents of divine revelation that proceed from these most blessed and hallowed precincts tongue of this temple we verily have created thee through our name the all merciful have taught thee whatsoever had remained concealed in the bayán and have bestowed upon thee the power of utterance that thou mayest make mention of mine exalted self amidst my creatures proclaim then this wondrous and mighty remembrance and fear not the manifestations of the evil one thou wert called into being for this very purpose by virtue of my transcendent and all compelling command through thee have we unloosed the tongue of utterance to expound all that hath been and we shall again by my sovereign power unloose it to speak of that which is yet to come erelong shall we bring into being through thee eloquent tongues that will praise and extol me amongst the concourse of eternity and amidst the peoples of the world thus have the verses of god been revealed and thus hath it been decreed by the lord of all names and attributes thy lord verily is the true one the knower of things unseen nothing whatsoever shall prevent these tongues from magnifying their creator through them all created things shall arise to glorify the lord of names and to bear witness that there is none other god save me the all powerful the most glorious the best beloved nor shall those who make mention of me speak aught unless they be inspired by this tongue from its heavenly garden few however are they who understand no tongue is there that speaketh not the praises of its lord and maketh not mention of his name amongst the people however are those who understand and utter praises and those who utter praises yet understand not maid of inner meanings step out of the chamber of utterance by the leave of god the lord of the heavens and the earth reveal then thyself adorned with the raiment of the celestial realm and proffer with thy ruby fingers the wine of the heavenly dominion that haply the denizens of this world may perceive that the daystar of eternity shone forth above the horizon of the kingdom with the adornment of glory perchance they may arise before the dwellers of earth and heaven to extol and magnify this youth who hath established himself in the midmost heart of paradise upon the throne of his name the most bountiful—he from whose countenance shineth the brightness of the all merciful from whose gaze appear the glances of the all glorious and in whose ways are revealed the tokens and evidences of god the help in peril the self subsisting grieve not if none be found to accept the crimson wine proffered by thy snow white hand and to seize it in the name of thy lord the most exalted the most high—he who hath appeared again in his name the most glorious leave this people unto themselves and repair unto the tabernacle of majesty and glory wherein thou shalt encounter people whose faces shine as brightly as the sun in its noontide splendour and who praise and extol their lord in this name that hath arisen in the plenitude of might and power to assume the throne of independent sovereignty from their lips thou shalt hear naught but the strains of my praise unto this thy lord beareth me witness the existence of these people however hath remained concealed from the eyes of all who from everlasting have been created through the word of god thus have we made plain our meaning and set forth our verses that perchance men may reflect upon the signs and tokens of their lord these are they who in truth were not enjoined to prostrate themselves before adam they have never turned away from the countenance of thy lord and partake at every moment of the gifts and delights of holiness thus hath the pen of the all merciful set forth the secrets of all things be they of the past or of the future would that the world might understand erelong shall god make manifest this people upon the earth and through them shall exalt his name diffuse his signs uphold his words and proclaim his verses in spite of those that have repudiated his truth gainsaid his sovereignty and cavilled at his signs beauty of the all glorious shouldst thou chance upon this people and enter their presence recount unto them that which this youth hath related unto thee concerning himself and the things that have befallen him that they may come to know what hath been inscribed upon the preserved tablet acquaint them with the tidings of this youth and with the trials and tribulations he hath suffered that they may become mindful of mine afflictions and be of them that are occupied with his remembrance recount then unto them how we singled out for our favour one of our brothers how we imparted unto him dewdrop from the fathomless ocean of knowledge clothed him with the garment of one of our names and exalted him to such station that all were moved to extol him and how we so protected him from the harm of the malevolent as to disarm even the mightiest amongst them we arose alone before the gaze of the peoples of earth and heaven at time when all had determined to slay us while dwelling in their midst we continually made mention of the lord celebrated his praise and stood firm in his cause until at last the word of god was vindicated amongst his creatures his signs were spread abroad his power exalted and his sovereignty revealed in its full splendour to this bear witness all his honoured servants yet when my brother beheld the rising fame of the cause he became filled with arrogance and pride thereupon he emerged from behind the veil of concealment rose up against me disputed my verses denied my testimony and repudiated my signs nor would his hunger be appeased unless he were to devour my flesh and drink my blood to this testify such of god’s servants as have accompanied him in his exile and beyond them they that enjoy near access unto him to this end he conferred with one of my servants and sought to win him over to his own designs whereupon the lord despatched unto mine assistance the hosts of the seen and the unseen protected me by the power of truth and sent down upon me that which thwarted his purpose thus were foiled the plots of those who disbelieve in the verses of the all merciful they truly are rejected people when news spread of that which the promptings of self had impelled my brother to attempt and our companions in exile learned of his nefarious design the voice of their indignation and grief was lifted up and threatened to spread throughout the city we forbade however such recriminations and enjoined upon them patience that they might be of those that endure steadfastly by god besides whom is none other god we withstood all these trials with forbearance and enjoined upon god’s servants to show forth patience and fortitude removing ourself from their midst we took up residence in another house that perchance the flame of envy might be quenched in our brother’s breast and that he might be guided aright we neither opposed him nor saw him again thereafter but remained in our home placing our hopes in the bounty of god the help in peril the self subsisting when however he realized that his deed had been exposed he seized the pen of calumny and wrote unto the servants of god attributing what he had himself committed unto mine own peerless and wronged beauty his purpose was none other than to inspire mischief and to instil hatred into the hearts of those who had believed in god the all glorious the all loving by the one in whose hand is my soul we were dismayed by his deceitfulness—nay bewildered were all things visible and invisible nor did he find respite from what he harboured in his bosom until he had committed that which no pen dare describe and by which he disgraced the dignity of my station and profaned the sanctity of god the almighty the all glorious the all praised were god to turn all the oceans of the earth into ink and all created things into pens they would not suffice me to exhaust the record of his wrongdoings thus do we recount that which befell us that haply ye may be of them that understand pen of eternity grieve not at the things that have befallen thee for erelong shall god raise up people who will see with their own eyes and will recall thy tribulations withhold thy pen from the mention of thine enemies and bestir it in the praise of the eternal king renounce all created things and quaff the sealed wine of my remembrance beware lest thou become occupied with the mention of those from whom naught save the noisome savours of enmity can be perceived those who are so enslaved by their lust for leadership that they would not hesitate to destroy themselves in their desire to emblazon their fame and perpetuate their names god hath recorded such souls in the preserved tablet as mere worshippers of names recount then that which thou hast purposed for this temple that its signs and tokens may be made manifest upon earth and that the brightness of this light may illumine the horizons of the world and cleanse the earth from the defilement of those who have disbelieved in god thus have we set down the verses of god and made plain the matter unto those who understand living temple stretch forth thy hand over all who are in heaven and on earth and seize within the grasp of thy will the reins of command we have verily placed in thy right hand the empire of all things do as thou willest and fear not the ignorant reach out to the tablet that hath dawned above the horizon of the pen of thy lord and take hold of it in such wise that through thee the hands of all who inhabit the earth may be enabled to lay fast hold upon it this in truth is that which becometh thee if thou be of those who understand through the upraising of thy hand to the heaven of my grace the hands of all created things shall be lifted up to their lord the mighty the powerful the gracious erelong shall we raise up through the aid of thy hand other hands endued with power with strength and might and shall establish through them our dominion over all that dwell in the realms of revelation and creation thus will the servants of god recognize the truth that there is none other god beside me the help in peril the self subsisting with these hands moreover we shall both bestow and withhold though none can understand this save those who see with the eye of the spirit say people can ye ever hope to escape the sovereign power of your lord by the righteousness of god no refuge will ye find in this day and no one to protect you save those upon whom god hath bestowed the favour of his mercy he verily is the ever forgiving the most compassionate say people forsake all that ye possess and enter beneath the shadow of your lord the all merciful better is this for you than all your works of the past and of the future fear ye god and deprive not yourselves of the sweet savours of the days of god the lord of all names and attributes take heed lest ye alter or pervert the text of the word of god walk ye in the fear of god and be numbered with the righteous say people this is the hand of god which hath ever been above your own hands could ye but understand within its grasp we have ordained all the good of the heavens and the earth such that no good shall be made manifest but that it proceedeth therefrom thus have we made it the source and treasury of all good both aforetime and hereafter say the rivers of divine wisdom and utterance which flowed through the tablets of god are joined to this most great ocean could ye but perceive it and whatever hath been set forth in his books hath attained its final consummation in this most exalted word—a word shining above the horizon of the will of the all glorious in this revelation which hath filled with delight all things seen and unseen erelong shall god draw forth out of the bosom of power the hands of ascendancy and might—hands who will arise to win victory for this youth and who will purge mankind from the defilement of the outcast and the ungodly these hands will gird up their loins to champion the faith of god and will in my name the self subsistent the mighty subdue the peoples and kindreds of the earth they will enter the cities and will inspire with fear the hearts of all their inhabitants such are the evidences of the might of god how fearful how vehement is his might and how justly doth he wield it he verily ruleth and transcendeth all who are in the heavens and on the earth and revealeth what he desireth according to prescribed measure should any one of them be called upon to confront all the hosts of creation he would assuredly prevail through the ascendancy of my will this verily is proof of my power though my creatures comprehend it not this verily is sign of my sovereignty though my subjects understand it not this verily is token of my command though my servants perceive it not this verily is an evidence of mine ascendancy though none amongst the people is truly thankful for it save those whose eyes god hath illumined with the light of his knowledge whose hearts he hath made the repository of his revelation and upon whose shoulders he hath placed the weight of his cause these shall inhale the fragrances of the all merciful from the garment of his name and shall rejoice at all times in the signs and verses of their lord as for those who disbelieve in god and join partners with him they shall indeed incur his wrath shall be cast into the fire and shall be made to dwell fearful and dismayed in its depths thus do we expound our verses and make plain the truth with clear proofs that perchance the people may reflect upon the signs of their lord living temple we have in very truth appointed thee to be the sign of my majesty amidst all that hath been and all that shall be and have ordained thee to be the emblem of my cause betwixt the heavens and the earth through my word “be” and it is first letter of this temple betokening the essence of divinity we have made thee the treasury of my will and the repository of my purpose unto all who are in the kingdoms of revelation and creation this is but token of the grace of him who is the help in peril the self subsisting second letter of this temple betokening my name the almighty we have made thee the manifestation of our sovereignty and the dayspring of our names potent am to fulfil that which my tongue speaketh third letter of this temple betokening my name the all bountiful we have made thee the dawning place of our bounty amidst our creatures and the fountainhead of our generosity amidst our people powerful am in my dominion nothing whatsoever of all that hath been created in the heavens or on the earth can escape my knowledge and am the true one the knower of things unseen send down out of the clouds of thy generosity that which shall enrich all created things and withhold not thy favours from the world of being thou verily art the all bountiful in the heaven of thine eternity and the lord of infinite grace unto all who inhabit the kingdom of names look not upon the people and the things they possess look rather upon the wonders of thy gifts and favours gather then thy servants beneath thy shade that shadoweth all mankind stretch forth the hand of bounty over all creation and the fingers of bestowal over all existence this verily is that which beseemeth thee though the people understand it not whosoever turneth his face towards thee doeth so by thy grace and as to him who turneth away thy lord in truth is independent of all created things unto this bear witness his true and devoted servants erelong shall god raise up through thee hands of indomitable strength and arms of invincible might who will come forth from behind the veils will render the all merciful victorious amongst the peoples of the world and will raise so mighty cry as to cause all hearts to tremble with fear thus hath it been decreed in written tablet such shall be the ascendancy which these souls will evince that consternation and dismay will seize all the dwellers of the earth beware lest ye shed the blood of anyone unsheathe the sword of your tongue from the scabbard of utterance for therewith ye can conquer the citadels of men’s hearts we have abolished the law to wage holy war against each other god’s mercy hath verily encompassed all created things if ye do but understand aid ye your lord the god of mercy with the sword of understanding keener indeed is it and more finely tempered than the sword of utterance were ye but to reflect upon the words of your lord thus have the hosts of divine revelation been sent down by god the help in peril the self subsisting and thus have the armies of divine inspiration been made manifest from the source of command as bidden by god the all glorious the best beloved say the measure of all created things hath been appointed in this concealed and manifest temple wherein lie enshrined the knowledge of the heavens and the earth and of all things past and future the finger of god’s handiwork hath inscribed upon this tablet that which the wisest and most learned of men are powerless to fathom and hath created therein temples inscrutable to all save his own self could ye but apprehend this truth blessed be the one who readeth it who pondereth its contents and who is numbered with them that comprehend say naught is seen in my temple but the temple of god and in my beauty but his beauty and in my being but his being and in my self but his self and in my movement but his movement and in my acquiescence but his acquiescence and in my pen but his pen the mighty the all praised there hath not been in my soul but the truth and in myself naught could be seen but god beware lest ye speak of duality in regard to my self for all the atoms of the earth proclaim that there is none other god but him the one the single the mighty the loving from the beginning that hath no beginning have proclaimed from the realm of eternity that am god none other god is there save me the help in peril the self subsisting and unto the end that hath no end shall proclaim amidst the kingdom of names that am god none other god is there beside me the all glorious the best beloved say lordship is my name whereof have created manifestations in the world of being while we ourself remain sanctified above them would ye but ponder this truth and godhead is my name whereof we have created exponents whose power shall encompass the people of the earth and make them true worshippers of god could ye but recognize it thus should ye regard all our names if ye be endued with insight fourth letter of this temple betokening the attribute of grace we have made thee the manifestation of grace betwixt earth and heaven from thee have we generated all grace in the contingent world and unto thee shall we cause it to return and from thee shall we manifest it again through word of our command potent am to accomplish whatsoever desire through my word “be” and it is every grace that appeareth in the world of being hath originated from thee and unto thee shall it return this verily is what hath been ordained in tablet which we have preserved behind the veil of glory and concealed from mortal eyes well is it with them that deprive themselves not of this conferred and unfailing grace say in this day the fertilizing winds of the grace of god have passed over all things every creature hath been endowed with all the potentialities it can carry and yet the peoples of the world have denied this grace every tree hath been endowed with the choicest fruits every ocean enriched with the most luminous gems man himself hath been invested with the gifts of understanding and knowledge the whole creation hath been made the recipient of the revelation of the all merciful and the earth the repository of things inscrutable to all except god the truth the knower of things unseen the time is approaching when every created thing will have cast its burden glorified be god who hath vouchsafed this grace that encompasseth all things whether seen or unseen thus have we created the whole earth anew in this day yet most of the people have failed to perceive it say the grace of god can never be adequately understood how much less can his own self the help in peril the self subsisting be comprehended temple of the cause grieve not if thou findest none ready to receive thy gifts thou wast created for my sake occupy thyself therefore with my praise amidst my servants this is that which hath been ordained for thee in the preserved tablet having found upon the earth many soiled hand we sanctified the hem of thy garment from the profanity of their touch and placed it beyond the reach of the ungodly be patient in the cause of thy lord for erelong shall he raise up sanctified hearts and illumined eyes who shall flee from every quarter unto thine all encompassing and boundless grace temple of god no sooner had the hosts of divine revelation been sent down by the lord of all names and attributes bearing the banners of his signs than the exponents of doubt and fancy were put to flight they disbelieved in the clear tokens of god the help in peril the self subsisting and rose up against him in enmity and opposition amongst them were those who claimed “these are not clear verses from god nor do they proceed from an innate and untaught nature thus do the unbelievers seek to remedy the sickness of their hearts utterly heedless that they thus render themselves accursed of all who dwell in heaven and on earth say the holy spirit itself hath been generated through the agency of single letter revealed by this most great spirit if ye be of them that comprehend and that innate and untaught nature in its essence is called into being by the verses of god the help in peril the all glorious the best beloved say this nature prideth itself in its relation to our transcendent truth whilst we for our part glory neither in it nor in aught else for all beside myself hath been created through the potency of my word could ye but understand say we have revealed our verses in nine different modes each one of them bespeaketh the sovereignty of god the help in peril the self subsisting single one of them sufficeth for proof unto all who are in the heavens and on the earth yet the people for the most part persist in their heedlessness should it be our wish we would reveal them in countless other modes say people fear ye god and allow not your tongues to utter in their deceitfulness that which displeaseth him stand abashed before the one who as ye well know hath created you out of drop of water say we have created all that are in heaven and on earth in the nature made by god whosoever turneth unto this blessed countenance shall manifest the potentialities of that inborn nature and whosoever remaineth veiled therefrom shall be deprived of this invisible and all encompassing grace verily there is naught from which our favour hath been withheld inasmuch as we have dealt equitably in the fashioning of each and all and by word of our mouth presented unto them the trust of our love they that have accepted it are indeed safe and secure and are numbered among those who are immune from the terrors of this day those however who have rejected it have in truth disbelieved in god the help in peril the self subsisting thus do we distinguish between the people and pronounce judgement upon them we of certainty have the power to discern say the word of god can never be confounded with the words of his creatures it is in truth the king of words even as he is himself the sovereign lord of all and his cause transcendeth all that was and all that shall be enter people the city of certitude wherein the throne of your lord the all merciful hath been established thus biddeth you the pen of the all glorious as token of his unfailing grace haply ye may not make his revelation cause of dissension amongst you among the infidels are those who have repudiated his self and risen up against his cause and who claim that these divine verses are contrived such also were the objections of the deniers of old who now implore deliverance from the fire say woe betide you for the idle words that proceed from your mouths if these verses be indeed contrived then by what proof have ye believed in god produce it if ye be men of understanding whensoever we revealed our clear verses unto such men they rejected them and whensoever they beheld that which the combined forces of the earth are powerless to produce they pronounced it sorcery what aileth this people that they speak of that which they understand not they raise the same objections as did the followers of the qur’án when their lord came unto them with his cause they verily are rejected people they hindered others from appearing before him who is the ancient beauty and from sharing the bread of his loved ones “approach them not one was even heard to say “for they cast spell upon the people and lead them astray from the path of god the help in peril the self subsisting by the righteousness of the one true god he who is incapable of speaking in our presence is uttering such words as none among the former generations hath ever spoken and hath committed such acts as none of the unbelievers of bygone ages hath ever committed the very words and deeds of these men bear eloquent testimony to the truth of my words if ye be of them that judge with fairness whosoever attributeth the verses of god to sorcery hath not believed in any of his messengers hath lived and laboured in vain and is accounted of those who speak that of which they have no knowledge say servant fear god thy creator and thy fashioner and transgress not against him but judge with fairness and act with justice those whom the lord hath endued with knowledge shall find in the very objections raised by the unbelievers conclusive proofs to invalidate their claims and vindicate the truth of this manifest light say would ye repeat that which the unbelievers uttered when message came unto them from their lord woe betide you assemblage of foolish ones and blighted be your works ancient beauty turn aside from the unbelievers and that which they possess and waft over all created things the sweet savours of the remembrance of thy beloved the exalted the great this remembrance quickeneth the world of being and reneweth the temples of all created things say he verily hath established himself upon the throne of might and glory whosoever desireth to gaze upon his countenance lo behold him standing before thee blessed be the lord who hath revealed himself in this shining and luminous beauty whosoever desireth to hearken unto his melodies lo hear them rising from his resplendent and wondrous lips and unto whosoever desireth to be illumined by the splendours of his light say seek the court of his presence for god hath verily granted you leave to approach it as token of his grace unto all mankind say people we shall put to you question in all truthfulness taking god for witness between you and us he verily is the defender of the righteous appear then before his throne of glory and make reply with justice and fair mindedness is it god who is potent to achieve his purpose or is it ye who enjoy such authority is it he who is truly unconstrained as ye imply when ye say that he doeth what he pleaseth and shall not be asked of his doings or is it ye who wield such power and who merely make such assertions out of blind imitation as did your forebears at the appearance of every other messenger of god if he be truly unconstrained behold then how he hath sent down the manifestation of his cause with verses which naught in the heavens or on the earth can withstand such hath been the manner of their revelation that they have neither peer nor likeness in the world of being as ye yourselves beheld and heard when once the daystar of the world shone forth above the horizon of ‘iráq with manifest dominion all things attain their consummation in the divine verses and these indeed are the verses of god the sovereign lord the help in peril the all glorious the almighty beyond this he hath been made manifest as the bearer of cause whose sovereign might is acknowledged by all created things and this none can deny save the sinners and the ungodly say people is it your wish to conceal the beauty of the sun behind the veils of your own selfish desires or to prevent the spirit from raising its melodies within this sanctified and luminous breast fear ye god and contend not with him who representeth the godhead dispute not with the one at whose bidding the letter “b” was created and joined with its mighty foundation believe in the messengers of god and his sovereign might and in the self of god and his majesty follow not those who have repudiated what they had once believed and who have sought for themselves station after their own fancy these truly are of the ungodly bear ye witness unto that whereunto god himself hath borne witness that the company of his favoured ones may be illumined by the words that issue from your lips say we verily believe in that which was revealed unto the apostles of old in that which hath been revealed by the power of truth unto ‘alí and in that which is now being revealed from his throne of glory thus doth your lord instruct you as sign of his favour and as token of his grace that encompasseth all the worlds feet of this temple we verily have wrought you of iron stand firm with such constancy in the cause of your lord as to cause the feet of every severed soul to be strengthened in the path of god the almighty the all wise beware lest the storms of enmity and hatred or the blasts of the workers of iniquity cause you to stumble be immovable in the faith of god and waver not we verily have called you forth by virtue of that name which is the source of all steadfastness and by the grace of each one of our most excellent names as revealed unto all who are in heaven and on earth erelong shall we bring into being through you other feet firm and steadfast which shall walk unwaveringly in our path even should they be assailed by hosts as formidable as the combined forces of the former and latter generations in truth we hold all grace in the hollow of our hand and bestow it as we please upon our favoured servants time and again have we vouchsafed unto you our favours that ye may offer such thanks unto your lord as to cause the tongues of all created things to speak forth in praise of me the all merciful the most compassionate arise to serve this cause through might and power born of us disclose then unto the servants of god all that the spirit of god the sovereign lord the incomparable the all glorious the all wise hath imparted unto thee say people will ye turn away from him who is the eternal truth and choose instead him whom we have created out of mere handful of clay to do so is to inflict grievous injustice upon yourselves if ye be of them that reflect upon the verses of your lord say people cleanse your hearts and your eyes that ye may recognize your maker in this holy and luminous attire say the celestial youth hath ascended the throne of glory made manifest his independent sovereignty and now voiceth in the most sweet and wondrous accents this call betwixt earth and heaven “o peoples of the earth wherefore have ye disbelieved in your lord the all merciful and turned aside from him who is the beauty of the all glorious by the righteousness of god this is his hidden secret who hath risen from the dayspring of creation and this is his cherished beauty who hath shone forth above the horizon of this heavenly garden invested with the sovereignty of god the help in peril the all glorious the all subduing the almighty temple of holiness we verily have cleansed thy breast from the whisperings of the people and sanctified it from earthly allusions that the light of my beauty may appear therein and be reflected in the mirrors of all the worlds thus have we singled thee out above all that hath been created in the heavens and the earth and above all that hath been decreed in the realms of revelation and creation and chosen thee for our own self this is but an evidence of the bounty which god hath vouchsafed unto thee bounty which shall last until the day that hath no end in this contingent world it shall endure so long as god the supreme king the help in peril the mighty the wise shall endure for the day of god is none other but his own self who hath appeared with the power of truth this is the day that shall not be followed by night nor shall it be bounded by any praise would that ye might understand breast of this temple we verily have caused all things to mirror forth thy reality and made thee as mirror of our own self shed then upon the breasts of all created beings the splendours of the light of thy lord that they may be freed from all allusions and limitations thus hath the daystar of wisdom shone forth above the horizon of the pen of the eternal king blessed are those who perceive it through thee have we created other sanctified breasts and unto thee shall we cause them to return as token of our grace unto thee and unto our favoured servants erelong shall we bring into being through thee men with sanctified and illumined breasts who will testify to naught save my beauty and show forth naught but the resplendent light of my countenance these shall in truth be the mirrors of my names amidst all created things temple of holiness we verily have made thine inmost heart the treasury of all the knowledge of past and future ages and the dawning place of our own knowledge which we have ordained for the dwellers of earth and heaven that all creation may partake of the outpourings of thy grace and may attain through the wonders of thy knowledge unto the recognition of god the exalted the powerful the great in truth that knowledge which belongeth unto mine own essence is such as none hath ever attained or will ever grasp nor shall any heart be capable of bearing its weight were but single word of this knowledge to be disclosed the hearts of all men would be filled with consternation the foundations of all things would crumble into ruin and the feet of even the wisest among men would be made to slip within the treasury of our wisdom there lieth unrevealed knowledge one word of which if we chose to divulge it to mankind would cause every human being to recognize the manifestation of god and to acknowledge his omniscience would enable every one to discover the secrets of all the sciences and to attain so high station as to find himself wholly independent of all past and future learning other knowledges we do as well possess not single letter of which we can disclose nor do we find humanity able to hear even the barest reference to their meaning thus have we informed you of the knowledge of god the all knowing the all wise were we to find worthy vessels we would impart unto them the treasures of hidden meanings and apprise them of knowledge one letter of which would encompass all created things inmost heart of this temple we have made thee the dawning place of our knowledge and the dayspring of our wisdom unto all who are in heaven and on earth from thee have we caused all sciences to appear and unto thee shall we cause them to return and from thee shall we bring them forth second time such indeed is our promise and potent are we to effect our purpose erelong shall we bring into being through thee exponents of new and wondrous sciences of potent and effective crafts and shall make manifest through them that which the heart of none of our servants hath yet conceived thus do we bestow upon whom we will whatsoever we desire and thus do we withdraw from whom we will what we had once bestowed even so do we ordain whatsoever we please through our behest say should we choose at one time to shed the radiance of our loving providence upon the mirrors of all things and at another to withhold from them the splendours of our light this verily lieth within our power and none hath the right to ask “why” or “wherefore” for we are potent indeed to achieve our purpose and render no account for that which we bring to pass and none can doubt this save those who join partners with god and question his truth say nothing can withstand the power of our might or interrupt the course of our command we exalt whomsoever we please unto the realm of supernal might and glory and should we so desire cause the same to sink into the lowest abyss of degradation dwellers of the earth would ye contend that if we raise up soul unto the sadratu’l muntahá it shall then cease to be subject to the power of our sovereignty and dominion nay by mine own self should it be our wish we would return it to the dust in less than the twinkling of an eye consider tree behold how we plant it in garden and nourish it with the waters of our loving care and how when it hath grown tall and mature and brought forth verdant leaves and goodly fruits lo we send forth the tempestuous gales of our decree and lay it uprooted and prostrate upon the face of the earth so hath it been our way with all things and so shall it be in this day such in truth are the matchless wonders of our immutable method—a method which hath ever governed and shall continue to govern all things if ye be of them that perceive none however knoweth the wisdom thereof save god the all powerful the almighty the all wise would ye gainsay people the very thing that your eyes behold woe unto you assemblage of deniers that which alone is exempt from change is his own self the all merciful the most compassionate were ye to gaze with the eye of insight while all else beside him can be altered by an act of his will he verily is the all powerful the almighty the all wise people dispute not concerning my cause for ye shall never fathom the manifold wisdom of your lord nor shall ye ever gauge the knowledge of him who is the all glorious the all pervading whosoever layeth claim to have known his essence is without doubt among the most ignorant of all people every atom in the universe would charge such man with imposture and to this beareth witness my tongue which speaketh naught but the truth magnify my cause and promulgate my teachings and commandments for none other course beside this shall beseem you and no other path shall ever lead unto him would that ye might heed our counsel living temple we have made thee the dayspring of each one of our most excellent titles the dawning place of each one of our most august attributes and the fountainhead of each one of our manifold virtues unto the denizens of earth and heaven thereafter have we raised thee up in our own image betwixt the heavens and the earth and ordained thee to be the sign of our glory unto all who are in the realms of revelation and creation that my servants may follow in thy footsteps and be of them who are guided aright we have appointed thee the tree of grace and bounty unto the dwellers of both the heavens and the earth well is it with them who seek the shelter of thy shade and who draw nigh unto thy self the omnipotent protector of the worlds say we have made each one of our names wellspring from which we have caused the streams of divine wisdom and understanding to gush forth and flow in the garden of our cause—streams whose number none can reckon save thy lord the most holy the omnipotent the omniscient the all wise say we have generated all letters from the point and have caused them to return unto it and we have sent it down again in the form of human temple all glory be unto the author of this incomparable and wondrous handiwork erelong shall we unfold and expound it again in our name the all glorious this is indeed token of our grace and truly am the most bountiful the ancient of days we have brought forth all lights from the orb of our name the true one have caused them to return unto it and have again made them manifest in the form of human temple all glory be unto the lord of strength might and power none can withstand the operation of my will or the exercise of my might am he who hath raised up all creatures through word of my mouth and my power is in truth equal to my purpose say it is in our power should we wish it to cause all created things to expire in an instant and with the next to endue them again with life the knowledge thereof however is with god alone the all knowing the all informed it is in our power should we wish it to enable speck of floating dust to generate in less than the twinkling of an eye suns of infinite of unimaginable splendour to cause dewdrop to develop into vast and numberless oceans to infuse into every letter such force as to empower it to unfold all the knowledge of past and future ages this in truth is matter simple of accomplishment such have been the evidences of my power from the beginning that hath no beginning until the end that hath no end my creatures however have been oblivious of my power have repudiated my sovereignty and contended with mine own self the all knowing the all wise say of all that lieth between heaven and earth naught can stir except by my leave and unto my kingdom none can ascend save at my behest my creatures however have remained veiled from my might and my sovereignty and are numbered with the heedless say naught is seen in my revelation but the revelation of god and in my might but his might could ye but know it say my creatures are even as the leaves of tree they proceed from the tree and depend upon it for their existence yet remain oblivious of their root and origin we draw such similitudes for the sake of our discerning servants that perchance they may transcend mere plant like level of existence and attain unto true maturity in this resistless and immovable cause say my creatures are even as the fish of the deep their life dependeth upon the water and yet they remain unaware of that which by the grace of an omniscient and omnipotent lord sustaineth their very existence indeed their heedlessness is such that were they asked concerning the water and its properties they would prove entirely ignorant thus do we set forth comparisons and similitudes that perchance the people may turn unto him who is the object of the adoration of the entire creation people fear god and disbelieve not in him whose grace hath surrounded all things whose mercy hath pervaded the contingent world and the sovereign potency of whose cause hath encompassed both your inner and your outer beings both your beginning and your end stand ye in awe of the lord and be of them that act uprightly beware lest ye be accounted among those who allow the verses of their lord to pass them by unheard and unrecognized these truly are of the wayward say would ye worship him who neither heareth nor seeth and who is of truth the most abject and wayward of all god’s servants wherefore have ye failed to follow the one who hath come unto you from the source of divine command bearing the tidings of god the most exalted the most great people be not like unto those who entered before our throne and yet failed to perceive or comprehend these are indeed contemptible people we recited unto them verses that would enrapture the dwellers of the heavenly dominion and the inmates of the kingdom on high and yet they departed veiled therefrom and hearkened rather unto the voice of him who is but servant of god and mere creation of his will thus do we impart unto you that which shall guide you towards the path of god’s favoured ones how many those who entered within the abode of paradise the seat wherein the throne of god had been established and stood before their lord the most exalted the most great only to inquire about the four gates or of some imám of the islamic faith such was the state of these souls if ye be of them that comprehend it is even as ye witness in the present day those who have disbelieved in god and joined partners with him cling to single one of our names and are debarred from recognizing him who is the creator of all names we testify that such men are of truth amongst the people of the fire they ask the sun to expound the words of the shadow and the true one to explain the utterances of his creatures could ye but perceive it say people the sun offereth naught save the effulgence of its own light and that which appeareth therefrom whilst all else seek illumination from its rays fear god and be not of the ignorant among them also were those who inquired of the darkness about the light say open thine eyes that thou mayest behold the brightness which hath visibly enveloped the earth this verily is light which hath risen and shone forth above the horizon of the dayspring of divine knowledge with manifest radiance would ye ask the jews whether jesus was the true one from god or the idols if muḥammad was an apostle of his lord or inquire from the people of the qur’án as to him who was the remembrance of god the most exalted the most great say people cast away before the splendours of this revelation the things that ye possess and cleave to that which god hath bidden you observe such is his command unto you and he verily is best able to command by my beauty by those words which have revealed myself is not intended but rather he who will come after me to it is witness god the all knowing deal not with him as ye have dealt with me do not object when the verses of god are sent down unto you from the court of my favour saying “these do not proceed from an innate and untaught nature” for that nature itself hath been created by my word and circleth round me if ye be of them that apprehend this truth inhale from the utterances of your lord the all merciful the sweet smell of the garment of inner meanings which hath been diffused throughout the entire creation and hath shed its fragrance over all created things happy are those who perceive it and hasten unto god with radiant hearts living temple we verily have made thee mirror unto the kingdom of names that thou mayest be amidst all mankind sign of my sovereignty herald unto my presence summoner unto my beauty and guide unto my straight and perspicuous path we have exalted thy name among our servants as bounty from our presence verily am the all bountiful the ancient of days we have moreover adorned thee with the ornament of our own self and have imparted unto thee our word that thou mayest ordain in this contingent world whatsoever thou willest and accomplish whatsoever thou pleasest we have destined for thee all the good of the heavens and of the earth and decreed that none may attain unto portion thereof unless he entereth beneath thy shadow as bidden by thy lord the all knowing the all informed we have conferred upon thee the staff of authority and the writ of judgement that thou mayest test the wisdom of every command we have caused the oceans of inner meaning and explanation to surge from thy heart in remembrance of thy lord the god of mercy that thou mayest render thanks and praise unto him and be of those who are truly thankful we have singled thee out from amongst all our creatures and have appointed thee as the manifestation of our own self unto all who are in the heavens and on the earth bring then into being by our leave resplendent mirrors and exalted letters that shall testify to thy sovereignty and dominion bear witness to thy might and glory and be the manifestations of thy names amidst mankind we have caused thee again to be the origin and the creator of all mirrors even as we brought them forth from thee aforetime and we shall cause thee to return unto mine own self even as we called thee forth in the beginning thy lord verily is the unconstrained the all powerful the all compelling warn then these mirrors once they have been made manifest lest they swell with pride before their creator and fashioner when he appeareth amongst them or let the trappings of leadership debar them from bowing in submission before god the almighty the all beauteous say concourse of mirrors ye are but creation of my will and have come to exist by virtue of my command beware lest ye deny the verses of my lord and be of them who have wrought injustice and are numbered with the lost beware lest ye cling unto that which ye possess or take pride in your fame and renown that which behoveth you is to wholly detach yourselves from all that is in the heavens and on the earth thus hath it been ordained by him who is the all powerful the almighty temple of my cause say should wish to transform in single moment all things into mirrors of my names this undoubtedly is in my power how much more in the power of my lord who hath called me into being through his all compelling and inscrutable command and should choose to revolutionize the entire creation in the twinkling of an eye this assuredly is possible unto me how much more unto that sovereign purpose enshrined in the will of god my lord and the lord of all the worlds say ye manifestations of my names should ye offer up all that ye possess nay your very lives in the path of god and invoke him to the number of the grains of sand the drops of rain and the waves of the sea and yet oppose the manifestation of his cause at the time of his appearance your works shall in no wise be mentioned before god should ye however neglect all righteous works and yet choose to believe in him in these days god perchance will put away your sins he verily is the all glorious the most bountiful thus doth the lord inform you of his purpose that haply ye may not wax proud before the one through whom whatsoever hath been revealed from all eternity hath been confirmed happy is he who approacheth this most sublime vision and woe to them that turn aside how numerous those who expend all their wealth in the path of god and whom we find at the hour of his revelation to be of the rebellious and the froward how many those who keep the fast in the daytime only to protest against the one by whose very command the ordinance of the fast was first established such men are in truth of the ignorant and how many those who subsist on the coarsest bread who take for their only seat the grass of the field and who undergo every manner of hardship merely to maintain their superiority in the eyes of men thus do we expose their deeds that this may serve as warning unto others these are the ones who subject themselves to all manner of austerities before the gaze of others in the hope of perpetuating their names whilst in reality no mention shall remain of them save in the curses and imprecations of the dwellers of earth and heaven say would it profit you in the least if as ye fondly imagine your names were to endure nay by the lord of all worlds was the idol ‘uzzá made any greater by this that its name lived on amidst the worshippers of names nay by him who is the self of god the all glorious the all compelling should your names fade from every mortal mind and yet god be well pleased with you ye will indeed be numbered among the treasures of his name the most hidden thus have we sent down our verses that they may attract you unto the source of all lights and acquaint you with the purpose of your lord the all knowing the all wise abstain then from all that hath been forbidden unto you in the book and eat of the lawful things which god hath provided for your sustenance deprive not yourselves of his goodly bestowals for he verily is the most generous the lord of grace abounding subject not yourselves to excessive hardships but follow the way we have made plain unto you through our luminous verses and perspicuous proofs and be not of the negligent concourse of divines it is not yours to boast if ye abstain from drinking wine and from similar transgressions which have been forbidden you in the book for should ye commit such deeds the dignity of your station would then be tainted in the eyes of the people your affairs would be disrupted and your name disgraced and dishonoured nay your true and abiding glory resideth in submission to the word of him who is the eternal truth and in your inward and outward detachment from aught else besides god the all compelling the almighty great is the blessedness of that divine that hath not allowed knowledge to become veil between him and the one who is the object of all knowledge and who when the self subsisting appeared hath turned with beaming face towards him he in truth is numbered with the learned the inmates of paradise seek the blessing of his breath and his lamp sheddeth its radiance over all who are in heaven and on earth he verily is numbered with the inheritors of the prophets he that beholdeth him hath verily beheld the true one and he that turneth towards him hath verily turned towards god the almighty the all wise ye the dawning places of knowledge beware that ye suffer not yourselves to become changed for as ye change most men will likewise change this verily is an injustice unto yourselves and unto others unto this beareth witness every man of discernment and insight ye are even as spring if it be changed so will the streams that branch out from it be changed fear god and be numbered with the godly in like manner if the heart of man be corrupted his limbs will also be corrupted and similarly if the root of tree be corrupted its branches and its offshoots and its leaves and its fruits will be corrupted thus have we set forth similitudes for your instruction that perchance ye may not be debarred by the things ye possess from attaining unto that which hath been destined for you by him who is the all glorious the most bountiful it is indeed in our power to take up handful of dust and to adorn it with the vesture of our names this however would be but sign of our favour and not an indication of any merit it may have inherently possessed thus hath it been revealed in truth by him who is the sovereign revealer the all knowing consider the black stone which god hath made point whereunto all men turn in adoration hath this bounty been conferred upon it by virtue of its innate excellence nay by mine own self or doth such distinction stem from its intrinsic worth nay by mine own being whose essence all creation hath failed to grasp again consider the mosque of aqṣá and the other places which we have made sanctuaries unto the people in every land and region the honour and distinction they enjoy is in no wise due to their own merit but stemmeth from their relation to our manifestations whom we have appointed as the daysprings of our revelation amidst mankind if ye be of them that understand in this there lieth wisdom inscrutable to all save god inquire that he may graciously make plain unto you his purpose his knowledge verily embraceth all things detach yourselves people from the world and all its vanities and heed not the call of such as have disbelieved in god and joined partners with him arise above the horizon of utterance to extol and praise your lord the all merciful this is that which god hath purposed for you well is it with them who perceive it say people we have commanded you in our tablets to strive at the time of the promised revelation to sanctify your souls from all names and to purify them from all that hath been created in the heavens or on the earth that therein may appear the splendours of the sun of truth which shineth forth above the horizon of the will of your lord the almighty the most great we have moreover commanded you to cleanse your hearts from every trace of the love or hate of the peoples of the world lest aught should divert you from one course or impel you towards another this verily is among the weightiest counsels have vouchsafed unto you in the perspicuous book for whoso attacheth himself to either of these shall be prevented from attaining proper understanding of our cause to this beareth witness every just and discerning soul ye however have broken the covenant of god forgotten his testament and at last turned away from him whose appearance hath solaced the eyes of every true believer in the divine unity lift up the veils and coverings that obscure your vision and consider the testimonies of the prophets and messengers that haply ye may recognize the cause of god in these days when the promised one hath come invested with mighty sovereignty fear god and debar yourselves not from him who is the dayspring of his signs this shall in truth but profit your own selves as to your lord he verily can afford to dispense with all creatures from everlasting was he alone there was none else besides him he it is in whose name the standard of divine unity hath been planted upon the sinai of the visible and invisible worlds proclaiming that there is none other god but me the peerless the glorious the incomparable behold however how those who are but creation of his will and command have turned aside from him and have taken unto themselves lord and master beside god these truly are of the wayward the mention of the all merciful hath at all times been upon their lips and yet when he was manifested unto them through the power of truth they warred against him wretched indeed shall be the plight of such as have broken the covenant of their lord when the luminary of the world shone forth above the horizon of the will of god the most holy the all knowing the all wise it was against god that they unsheathed the swords of malice and hatred and yet they perceive it not methinks they remain dead and buried in the tombs of their selfish desires though the breeze of god hath blown over all regions they truly are wrapt in dense and grievous veil and oft as the verses of god are rehearsed unto them they persist in proud disdain it is as though they were devoid of all understanding or had never heard the melody of god the most exalted the all knowing say alas for you how can ye profess yourselves believers when ye deny the verses of god the almighty the all knowing say people turn your faces unto your lord the all merciful beware lest ye be veiled by aught that hath been revealed in the bayán it was in truth revealed for no other purpose than to make mention of me the all powerful the most high and had no other object than my beauty the whole world hath been filled with my testimony if ye be of them that judge with fairness had the primal point been someone else beside me as ye claim and had attained my presence verily he would have never allowed himself to be separated from me but rather we would have had mutual delights with each other in my days he in truth wept sore in his remoteness from me he preceded me that he might summon the people unto my kingdom as it hath been set forth in the tablets could ye but perceive it would that men of hearing might be found who could hear the voice of his lamentation in the bayán bewailing that which hath befallen me at the hands of these heedless souls bemoaning his separation from me and giving utterance to his longing to be united with me the mighty the peerless he verily beholdeth at this moment his best beloved amidst those who were created to attain his day and to prostrate themselves before him and yet who have inflicted in their tyranny such abasement upon him as the pen confesseth its inability to describe say people we verily summoned you in our former revelation unto this scene of transcendent glory this seat of stainless sanctity and announced unto you the advent of the days of god yet when the most great veil was rent asunder and the ancient beauty came unto you in the clouds of god’s decree ye repudiated him in whom ye had believed aforetime woe betide you company of infidels fear ye god and nullify not the truth with the things ye possess when the luminary of divine verses dawneth upon you from the horizon of the pen of the king of all names and attributes fall ye prostrate upon your faces before god the lord of the worlds for to bow down in adoration at the threshold of his door is indeed better for you than the worship of both worlds and to submit to his revelation is more profitable unto you than whatsoever hath been created in the heavens and on the earth say people admonish you wholly for the sake of god and seek no reward from you for my recompense shall be with god he who hath brought me into being raised me up by the power of truth and made me the source of his remembrance amidst his creatures hasten to behold this divine and glorious vision the spot wherein god hath established his seat follow not that which the evil one whispereth in your hearts for he verily doth prompt you to walk after your lusts and covetous desires and hindereth you from treading the straight path which this all embracing and all compelling cause hath opened say the evil one hath appeared in such wise as the eye of creation hath never beheld he who is the beauty of the all merciful hath likewise been made manifest with an adorning the like of which hath never been witnessed in the past the call of the all merciful hath been raised and behind it the call of satan well is it with them who hearken unto the voice of god and turn their faces towards his throne to behold most holy and blessed vision for whoso cherisheth in his heart the love of anyone beside me be it to the extent of grain of mustard seed shall be unable to gain admittance into my kingdom to this beareth witness that which adorneth the preamble of the book of existence could ye but perceive it say this is the day whereon god’s most great favour hath been made manifest the voice of all who are in the heavens above and on the earth below proclaimeth my name and singeth forth my praises could ye but hear it temple of divine revelation sound the trumpet in my name temple of divine mysteries raise the clarion call of thy lord the unconditioned the unconstrained maid of heaven step forth from the chambers of paradise and announce unto the people of the world by the righteousness of god he who is the best beloved of the worlds—he who hath ever been the desire of every perceiving heart the object of the adoration of all that are in heaven and on earth and the cynosure of the former and the latter generations—is now come take heed lest ye hesitate in recognizing this resplendent beauty when once he hath appeared in the plenitude of his sovereign might and majesty he verily is the true one and all else besides him is as naught before single one of his servants and paleth into nothingness when brought face to face with the revelation of his splendours hasten then to attain the living waters of his grace and be not of the negligent as to him who hesitateth though it be for less than moment god shall verily bring his works to naught and return him to the seat of wrath wretched indeed is the abode of them that tarry pope pius ix pope rend the veils asunder he who is the lord of lords is come overshadowed with clouds and the decree hath been fulfilled by god the almighty the unrestrained dispel the mists through the power of thy lord and ascend unto the kingdom of his names and attributes thus hath the pen of the most high commanded thee at the behest of thy lord the almighty the all compelling he verily hath again come down from heaven even as he came down from it the first time beware that thou dispute not with him even as the pharisees disputed with him without clear token or proof on his right hand flow the living waters of grace and on his left the choice wine of justice whilst before him march the angels of paradise bearing the banners of his signs beware lest any name debar thee from god the creator of earth and heaven leave thou the world behind thee and turn towards thy lord through whom the whole earth hath been illumined we have adorned the kingdom with the ornament of our name the all glorious thus hath it been decreed by god the fashioner of all things take heed lest thy vain imaginings withhold thee when once the sun of certitude hath shone forth above the horizon of the utterance of thy lord the mighty the beneficent dwellest thou in palaces whilst he who is the king of revelation liveth in the most desolate of abodes leave them unto such as desire them and set thy face with joy and delight towards the kingdom say peoples of the earth destroy the abodes of negligence with the hands of power and assurance and raise up the mansions of true knowledge within your hearts that the all merciful may shed the radiance of his light upon them better is this for you than all whereon the sun shineth and unto this beareth witness he who holdeth within his grasp the ultimate decree the breeze of god hath been wafted over the world at the advent of the desired one in his great glory whereupon every stone and clod of earth hath cried out “the promised one is come the kingdom is god’s the mighty the gracious the forgiving beware lest human learning debar thee from him who is the supreme object of all knowledge or lest the world deter thee from the one who created it and set it upon its course arise in the name of thy lord the god of mercy amidst the peoples of the earth and seize thou the cup of life with the hands of confidence first drink thou therefrom and proffer it then to such as turn towards it amongst the peoples of all faiths thus hath the moon of utterance risen above the horizon of wisdom and understanding tear asunder the veils of human learning lest they hinder thee from him who is my name the self subsisting call thou to remembrance him who was the spirit who when he came the most learned of his age pronounced judgement against him in his own country whilst he who was only fisherman believed in him take heed then ye men of understanding heart thou in truth art one of the suns of the heaven of his names guard thyself lest darkness spread its veils over thee and fold thee away from his light ponder then that which hath been sent down in the book by thy lord the almighty the all bountiful say still your pens concourse of divines for lo the shrill voice of the pen of glory hath been lifted up between earth and heaven cast away all that ye possess and take fast hold of that which we have revealed unto you with power and authority the hour that was concealed within the knowledge of god hath struck whereupon all the atoms of the earth have proclaimed “the ancient of days is come in his great glory hasten unto him peoples of the earth with humble and contrite hearts say we in truth have given ourself as ransom for your own lives alas when we came once again we beheld you fleeing from us whereat the eye of my loving kindness wept sore over my people fear god ye that perceive consider those who opposed the son when he came unto them with sovereignty and power how many the pharisees who were waiting to behold him and were lamenting over their separation from him and yet when the fragrance of his coming was wafted over them and his beauty was unveiled they turned aside from him and disputed with him thus do we impart unto thee that which hath been recorded in the books and scriptures none save very few who were destitute of any power amongst men turned towards his face and yet today every man endowed with power and invested with sovereignty prideth himself on his name in like manner consider how numerous in these days are the monks who in my name have secluded themselves in their churches and who when the appointed time was fulfilled and we unveiled our beauty knew us not though they call upon me at eventide and at dawn we behold them clinging to my name yet veiled from my self this verily is strange thing say take heed lest your devotions withhold you from him who is the object of all devotion or your worship debar you from him who is the object of all worship rend asunder the veils of your idle fancies this is your lord the almighty the all knowing who hath come to quicken the world and unite all who dwell on earth turn unto the dayspring of revelation people and tarry not be it for less than the twinkling of an eye read ye the evangel and yet refuse to acknowledge the all glorious lord this indeed beseemeth you not concourse of learned men say if ye deny this revelation by what proof have ye believed in god produce it then thus hath the summons of god been sent down by the pen of the most high at the bidding of your lord the most glorious in this tablet from whose horizon the splendour of his light hath shone forth how many are my servants whose deeds have become veils between them and their own selves and who have been kept back thereby from drawing nigh unto god he who causeth the winds to blow concourse of monks the fragrances of the all merciful have wafted over all creation happy the man that hath forsaken his desires and taken fast hold of guidance he indeed is of those who have attained unto the presence of god in this day day whereon commotions have seized the dwellers of the earth and filled with dismay all save those who have been exempted by god he who layeth low the necks of men adorn ye your bodies whilst the raiment of god is stained with the blood of hatred at the hands of the people of denial issue forth from your habitations and bid the people enter the kingdom of god the lord of the day of judgement the word which the son concealed is made manifest it hath been sent down in the form of the human temple in this day blessed be the lord who is the father he verily is come unto the nations in his most great majesty turn your faces towards him concourse of the righteous followers of all religions we behold you wandering distraught in the wilderness of error ye are the fish of this ocean wherefore do ye withhold yourselves from that which sustaineth you lo it surgeth before your faces hasten unto it from every clime this is the day whereon the rock crieth out and shouteth and celebrateth the praise of its lord the all possessing the most high saying “lo the father is come and that which ye were promised in the kingdom is fulfilled this is the word which was preserved behind the veils of grandeur and which when the promise came to pass shed its radiance from the horizon of the divine will with clear tokens my body hath borne imprisonment that your souls may be released from bondage and we have consented to be abased that ye may be exalted follow the lord of glory and dominion and not every ungodly oppressor my body longeth for the cross and mine head awaiteth the thrust of the spear in the path of the all merciful that the world may be purged from its transgressions thus hath the daystar of divine authority shone forth from the horizon of the revelation of him who is the possessor of all names and attributes the people of the qur’án have risen against us and tormented us with such torment that the holy spirit lamented and the thunder roared out and the clouds wept over us among the faithless is he who hath imagined that calamities can deter bahá from fulfilling that which god the creator of all things hath purposed say nay by him who causeth the rain to fall nothing whatsoever can withhold him from the remembrance of his lord by the righteousness of god should they cast him into fire kindled on the continent he will assuredly rear his head in the midmost heart of the ocean and proclaim “he is the lord of all that are in heaven and all that are on earth and if they cast him into darksome pit they will find him seated on earth’s loftiest heights calling aloud to all mankind “lo the desire of the world is come in his majesty his sovereignty his transcendent dominion and if he be buried beneath the depths of the earth his spirit soaring to the apex of heaven shall peal the summons “behold ye the coming of the glory witness ye the kingdom of god the most holy the gracious the all powerful and if they shed his blood every drop thereof shall cry out and invoke god in this name through which the fragrance of his raiment hath been diffused in all directions though threatened by the swords of our enemies we summon all mankind unto god the fashioner of earth and heaven and we render him such aid as can be hindered by neither the hosts of tyranny nor the ascendancy of the people of iniquity say peoples of the earth scatter the idols of your vain imaginings in the name of your lord the all glorious the all knowing and turn ye unto him in this day which god hath made the king of days supreme pontiff incline thine ear unto that which the fashioner of mouldering bones counselleth thee as voiced by him who is his most great name sell all the embellished ornaments thou dost possess and expend them in the path of god who causeth the night to return upon the day and the day to return upon the night abandon thy kingdom unto the kings and emerge from thy habitation with thy face set towards the kingdom and detached from the world then speak forth the praises of thy lord betwixt earth and heaven thus hath bidden thee he who is the possessor of names on the part of thy lord the almighty the all knowing exhort thou the kings and say “deal equitably with men beware lest ye transgress the bounds fixed in the book this indeed becometh thee beware lest thou appropriate unto thyself the things of the world and the riches thereof leave them unto such as desire them and cleave unto that which hath been enjoined upon thee by him who is the lord of creation should anyone offer thee all the treasures of the earth refuse to even glance upon them be as thy lord hath been thus hath the tongue of revelation spoken that which god hath made the ornament of the book of creation consider pearl which shineth by virtue of its inherent nature if it be covered with silk its luster and beauty will be concealed likewise man’s distinction lieth in the excellence of his conduct and in the pursuit of that which beseemeth his station not in childish play and pastimes know that thy true adornment consisteth in the love of god and in thy detachment from all save him and not in the luxuries thou dost possess abandon them unto those who seek after them and turn unto god he who causeth the rivers to flow whatever proceeded from the tongue of the son was revealed in parables whilst he who proclaimeth the truth in this day speaketh without them take heed lest thou cling to the cord of idle fancy and withhold thyself from that which hath been ordained in the kingdom of god the almighty the all bountiful should the inebriation of the wine of my verses seize thee and thou determinest to present thyself before the throne of thy lord the creator of earth and heaven make my love thy vesture and thy shield remembrance of me and thy provision reliance upon god the revealer of all power followers of the son we have once again sent john unto you and he verily hath cried out in the wilderness of the bayán peoples of the world cleanse your eyes the day whereon ye can behold the promised one and attain unto him hath drawn nigh followers of the gospel prepare the way the day of the advent of the glorious lord is at hand make ready to enter the kingdom thus hath it been ordained by god he who causeth the dawn to break give ear unto that which the dove of eternity warbleth upon the twigs of the divine lote tree followers of the son we sent forth him who was named john to baptize you with water that your bodies might be cleansed for the appearance of the messiah he in turn purified you with the fire of love and the water of the spirit in anticipation of these days whereon the all merciful hath purposed to cleanse you with the water of life at the hands of his loving providence this is that peerless one foretold by isaiah and the comforter concerning whom the spirit had covenanted with you open your eyes concourse of bishops that ye may behold your lord seated upon the throne of might and glory say peoples of all faiths walk not in the ways of them that followed the pharisees and thus veiled themselves from the spirit they truly have strayed and are in error the ancient beauty is come in his most great name and he wisheth to admit all mankind into his most holy kingdom the pure in heart behold the kingdom of god manifest before his face make haste

the sake of god and judgeth between men with pure justice he indeed is of the blissful ye the elected representatives of the people in every land take ye counsel together and let your concern be only for that which profiteth mankind and bettereth the condition thereof if ye be of them that scan heedfully regard the world as the human body which though at its creation whole and perfect hath been afflicted through various causes with grave disorders and maladies not for one day did it gain ease nay its sickness waxed more severe as it fell under the treatment of ignorant physicians who gave full rein to their personal desires and have erred grievously and if at one time through the care of an able physician member of that body was healed the rest remained afflicted as before thus informeth you the all knowing the all wise we behold it in this day at the mercy of rulers so drunk with pride that they cannot discern clearly their own best advantage much less recognize revelation so bewildering and challenging as this and whenever any one of them hath striven to improve its condition his motive hath been his own gain whether confessedly so or not and the unworthiness of this motive hath limited his power to heal or cure that which the lord hath ordained as the sovereign remedy and mightiest instrument for the healing of all the world is the union of all its peoples in one universal cause one common faith this can in no wise be achieved except through the power of skilled an all powerful and inspired physician this verily is the truth and all else naught but error each time that most mighty instrument hath come and that light shone forth from the ancient dayspring he was withheld by ignorant physicians who even as clouds interposed themselves between him and the world it failed therefore to recover and its sickness hath persisted until this day they indeed were powerless to protect it or to effect cure whilst he who hath been the manifestation of power amongst men was withheld from achieving his purpose by reason of what the hands of the ignorant physicians have wrought consider these days in which he who is the ancient beauty hath come in the most great name that he may quicken the world and unite its peoples they however rose up against him with sharpened swords and committed that which caused the faithful spirit to lament until in the end they imprisoned him in the most desolate of cities and broke the grasp of the faithful upon the hem of his robe were anyone to tell them “the world reformer is come” they would answer and say “indeed it is proven that he is fomenter of discord and this notwithstanding that they have never associated with him and have perceived that he did not seek for one moment to protect himself at all times he was at the mercy of the wicked doers at one time they cast him into prison at another they banished him and at yet another hurried him from land to land thus have they pronounced judgement against us and god truly is aware of what say such men are reckoned by god among the most ignorant of his creatures they cut off their own limbs and perceive it not they deprive themselves of that which is best for them and know it not they are even as young child who can distinguish neither the mischief maker from the reformer nor the wicked from the righteous we behold them in this day wrapt in palpable veil ye rulers of the earth wherefore have ye clouded the radiance of the sun and caused it to cease from shining hearken unto the counsel given you by the pen of the most high that haply both ye and the poor may attain unto tranquillity and peace we beseech god to assist the kings of the earth to establish peace on earth he verily doth what he willeth kings of the earth we see you increasing every year your expenditures and laying the burden thereof on your subjects this verily is wholly and grossly unjust fear the sighs and tears of this wronged one and lay not excessive burdens on your peoples do not rob them to rear palaces for yourselves nay rather choose for them that which ye choose for yourselves thus we unfold to your eyes that which profiteth you if ye but perceive your people are your treasures beware lest your rule violate the commandments of god and ye deliver your wards to the hands of the robber by them ye rule by their means ye subsist by their aid ye conquer yet how disdainfully ye look upon them how strange how very strange now that ye have refused the most great peace hold ye fast unto this the lesser peace that haply ye may in some degree better your own condition and that of your dependents rulers of the earth be reconciled among yourselves that ye may need no more armaments save in measure to safeguard your territories and dominions beware lest ye disregard the counsel of the all knowing the faithful be united kings of the earth for thereby will the tempest of discord be stilled amongst you and your peoples find rest if ye be of them that comprehend should any one among you take up arms against another rise ye all against him for this is naught but manifest justice thus did we exhort you in the tablet sent down aforetime and we admonish you once again to follow that which hath been revealed by him who is the almighty the all wise should anyone seek refuge with you extend unto him your protection and betray him not thus doth the pen of the most high counsel you as bidden by him who is the all knowing the all informed beware lest ye act as did the king of islám when we came unto him at his bidding his ministers pronounced judgement against us with such injustice that all creation lamented and the hearts of those who are nigh unto god were consumed the winds of self and passion move them as they will and we found them all bereft of constancy they are indeed of those that are far astray rein in thy pen pen of the ancient of days and leave them to themselves for they are immersed in their idle fancies make thou mention of the queen that she may turn with pure heart unto the scene of transcendent glory may withhold not her eyes from gazing toward her lord the supreme ordainer and may become acquainted with that which hath been revealed in the books and tablets by the creator of all mankind he through whom the sun hath been darkened and the moon eclipsed and through whom the call hath been raised betwixt earth and heaven turn thou unto god and say my sovereign lord am but vassal of thine and thou art in truth the king of kings have lifted my suppliant hands unto the heaven of thy grace and thy bounties send down then upon me from the clouds of thy generosity that which will rid me of all save thee and draw me nigh unto thyself beseech thee my lord by thy name which thou hast made the king of names and the manifestation of thyself to all who are in heaven and on earth to rend asunder the veils that have intervened between me and my recognition of the dawning place of thy signs and the dayspring of thy revelation thou art verily the almighty the all powerful the all bounteous deprive me not my lord of the fragrances of the robe of thy mercy in thy days and write down for me that which thou hast written down for thy handmaidens who have believed in thee and in thy signs and have recognized thee and set their hearts towards the horizon of thy cause thou art truly the lord of the worlds and of those who show mercy the most merciful assist me then my god to remember thee amongst thy handmaidens and to aid thy cause in thy lands accept then that which hath escaped me when the light of thy countenance shone forth thou indeed hast power over all things glory be to thee thou in whose hand is the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth náṣiri’d dínsháh king of the earth hearken unto the call of this vassal verily am servant who hath believed in god and in his signs and have sacrificed myself in his path unto this bear witness the woes which now beset me woes the like of which no man hath ever before sustained my lord the all knowing testifieth to the truth of my words have summoned the people unto none save god thy lord and the lord of the worlds and have endured for love of him such afflictions as the eye of creation hath never beheld to this testify those whom the veils of human fancy have not deterred from turning unto the most sublime vision and beyond them he with whom is the knowledge of all things in the preserved tablet whensoever the clouds of tribulation have rained down the darts of affliction in the path of god the lord of all names have hastened to meet them as every fair minded and discerning soul shall attest how many the nights which found the beasts of the field resting in their lairs and the birds of the air lying in their nests while this youth languished in chains and fetters with none to aid or succour him call thou to mind god’s mercy unto thee how when thou wert imprisoned with number of other souls he delivered thee and aided thee with the hosts of the seen and the unseen until the king sent thee to ‘iráq after we had disclosed unto him that thou wert not of the sowers of sedition those who follow their corrupt desires and lay aside the fear of god are indeed in grievous error they that spread disorder in the land shed the blood of men and wrongfully consume the substance of others—we verily are clear of them and we beseech god not to associate us with them whether in this world or in the world to come unless they should repent unto him he verily is of those who show mercy the most merciful whoso turneth towards god must distinguish himself from others by his every deed and follow that which hath been enjoined upon him in the book thus hath it been decreed in lucid tablet those however who cast behind their backs the commandments of god and follow the prompting of their own desires are verily in grievous error king adjure thee by thy lord the all merciful to look upon thy servants with the glances of the eye of thy favour and to treat them with justice that god may treat thee with mercy potent is thy lord to do as he pleaseth the world with all its abasement and glory shall pass away and the kingdom will remain unto god the most exalted the all knowing say he hath kindled the lamp of utterance and feedeth it with the oil of wisdom and understanding too high is thy lord the all merciful for aught in the universe to resist his faith he revealeth what he pleaseth through the power of his sovereign might and protecteth it with host of his well favoured angels he is supreme over his servants and exerciseth undisputed dominion over his creation he verily is the all knowing the all wise king was but man like others asleep upon my couch when lo the breezes of the all glorious were wafted over me and taught me the knowledge of all that hath been this thing is not from me but from one who is almighty and all knowing and he bade me lift up my voice between earth and heaven and for this there befell me what hath caused the tears of every man of understanding to flow the learning current amongst men studied not their schools entered not ask of the city wherein dwelt that thou mayest be well assured that am not of them who speak falsely this is but leaf which the winds of the will of thy lord the almighty the all praised have stirred can it be still when the tempestuous winds are blowing nay by him who is the lord of all names and attributes they move it as they list the evanescent is as nothing before him who is the ever abiding his all compelling summons hath reached me and caused me to speak his praise amidst all people was indeed as one dead when his behest was uttered the hand of the will of thy lord the compassionate the merciful transformed me can anyone speak forth of his own accord that for which all men both high and low will protest against him nay by him who taught the pen the eternal mysteries save him whom the grace of the almighty the all powerful hath strengthened the pen of the most high addresseth me saying fear not relate unto his majesty thesháh that which befell thee his heart verily is between the fingers of thy lord the god of mercy that haply the sun of justice and bounty may shine forth above the horizon of his heart thus hath the decree been sent down by him who is the all wise look upon this youth king with the eyes of justice judge thou then with truth concerning what hath befallen him of verity god hath made thee his shadow amongst men and the sign of his power unto all that dwell on earth judge thou between us and them that have wronged us without proof and without an enlightening book they that surround thee love thee for their own sakes whereas this youth loveth thee for thine own sake and hath had no desire except to draw thee nigh unto the seat of grace and to turn thee toward the right hand of justice thy lord beareth witness unto that which declare king wert thou to incline thine ear unto the shrill of the pen of glory and the cooing of the dove of eternity which on the branches of the lote tree beyond which there is no passing uttereth praises to god the maker of all names and creator of earth and heaven thou wouldst attain unto station from which thou wouldst behold in the world of being naught save the effulgence of the adored one and wouldst regard thy sovereignty as the most contemptible of thy possessions abandoning it to whosoever might desire it and setting thy face toward the horizon aglow with the light of his countenance neither wouldst thou ever be willing to bear the burden of dominion save for the purpose of helping thy lord the exalted the most high then would the concourse on high bless thee how excellent is this most sublime station couldst thou ascend thereunto through the power of sovereignty recognized as derived from the name of god amongst the people are those who allege that this youth hath had no purpose but to perpetuate his name whilst others claim that he hath sought for himself the vanities of the world—this notwithstanding that never throughout all my days have found place of safety be it to the extent of single foothold at all times have been immersed in an ocean of tribulations whose full measure none can fathom but god he truly is aware of what say how many the days in which my loved ones have been sorely shaken by reason of my afflictions and how many the nights during which my kindred fearing for my life have bitterly wept and lamented and this none can deny save them that are bereft of truthfulness is it conceivable that he who expecteth to lose his life at any moment should seek after worldly vanities how very strange the imaginings of those who speak as prompted by their own caprices and who wander distractedly in the wilderness of self and passion erelong shall they be called upon to account for their words and on that day they shall find none to befriend or help them and amongst the people are those who claim that he hath disbelieved in god—yet every member of my body testifieth that there is none other god but him that those whom he hath raised up in truth and sent forth with his guidance are the manifestations of his most excellent names the revealers of his most exalted attributes and the repositories of his revelation in the kingdom of creation that through them the proof of god hath been perfected unto all else but him the standard of divine unity hath been raised and the sign of sanctity hath been made manifest and that through them every soul hath found path unto the lord of the throne on high we testify that there is none other god but him that from everlasting he was alone with none else besides him and that he shall be unto everlasting what he hath ever been too high is the all merciful for the hearts of those who have recognized him to apprehend his true nature or for the minds of men to hope to fathom his essence he verily is exalted above the understanding of anyone besides himself and sanctified beyond the comprehension of all else save him from all eternity he hath been independent of the entire creation remember the days in which the sun of baṭḥá shone forth above the horizon of the will of thy lord the exalted the most high and recall how the divines of that age turned away from him and the learned contended with him that haply thou mayest apprehend that which in this day remaineth concealed behind the veils of glory so grievous became his plight on every side that he instructed his companions to disperse thus was the decree sent down from the heaven of divine glory remember furthermore how when one of these same companions came before the king of ethiopia and recited unto him súrih of the qur’án he declared to his attendants “this truly hath been revealed by one who is all knowing and all wise whoso acknowledgeth the truth and believeth in the teachings of jesus can in no wise deny what hath been recited we verily bear witness to its truth even as we bear witness to the truth of that which we possess of the books of god the help in peril the self subsisting swear by god king wert thou to incline thine ear to the melodies of that nightingale which warbleth in manifold accents upon the mystic bough as bidden by thy lord the all merciful thou wouldst cast away thy sovereignty and set thy face towards this scene of transcendent glory this station above whose horizon shineth the book of the dawntide and wouldst expend all that thou possessest in thine eagerness to obtain the things of god then wouldst thou find thyself raised up to the summit of exaltation and glory and elevated to the pinnacle of majesty and independence thus hath the decree been recorded in the mother book by the pen of the all merciful of what avail are the things which are yours today and which tomorrow others shall possess choose for thyself that which god hath chosen for his elect and god shall grant thee mighty sovereignty in his kingdom we beseech god to aid thy majesty to hearken unto that word whose radiance hath enveloped the whole world and to protect thee from such as have strayed far from the court of his presence glory be to thee lord my god how many the heads which were raised aloft on spears in thy path and how many the breasts which were made the target of arrows for the sake of thy good pleasure how many the hearts that have been lacerated for the exaltation of thy word and the promotion of thy cause and how many the eyes that have wept sore for love of thee implore thee thou who art the king of kings and the pitier of the downtrodden by thy most great name which thou hast made the dawning place of thy most excellent names and the dayspring of thy most exalted attributes to remove the veils that have come in between thee and thy creatures and debarred them from turning unto the horizon of thy revelation cause them then my god by thy most exalted word to turn from the left hand of oblivion and delusion unto the right hand of knowledge and certitude that they may know what thou hast purposed for them through thy bounty and grace and may set their faces towards him who is the manifestation of thy cause and the revealer of thy signs my god thou art the all bountiful whose grace is infinite withhold not thy servants from the most mighty ocean which thou hast made the repository of the pearls of thy knowledge and thy wisdom and turn them not away from thy gate which thou hast opened wide before all who are in thy heaven and all who are on thy earth lord leave them not to themselves for they understand not and flee from that which is better for them than all that thou hast created upon thine earth cast upon them my god the glances of the eye of thy favour and bounty and deliver them from self and passion that they may draw nigh unto thy most exalted horizon taste the sweetness of thy remembrance and delight in that bread which thou hast sent down from the heaven of thy will and the firmament of thy grace from everlasting thy bounty hath embraced the entire creation and thy mercy hath surpassed all things no god is there but thee the ever forgiving the most compassionate glorified art thou lord my god thou well knowest that mine heart hath melted in thy cause and that my blood so boileth in my veins with the fire of thy love that every drop of it proclaimeth with its inner tongue “grant that may be spilt upon the ground for thy sake my lord the most high that from it there may spring forth that which thou hast purposed in thy tablets and hast hidden from the eyes of all except such servants as have tasted of the crystal stream of knowledge from the hands of thy grace and quaffed the soft flowing waters of understanding from the cup of thy bestowal thou knowest my god that in all mine affairs have sought only to obey thy bidding that in mine every utterance have wished only to extol thy praise and that in whatsoever hath proceeded from my pen have purposed only to win thy good pleasure and to reveal that which thou hast enjoined upon me through thy sovereignty thou beholdest me my god as one bewildered in thy land whensoever make mention of that which thou hast enjoined upon me thy creatures cavil at me yet were to neglect that which thou hast bidden me observe would deserve the scourge of thine anger and would be far removed from the meadows of thy nearness nay by thy glory have set my face towards thy good pleasure and turned away from the things whereon thy servants have set their affections have embraced all that is with thee and forsaken all that might lead me away from the retreats of thy nearness and the heights of thy glory swear by thy might with thy love in my heart nothing can ever alarm me and in the path of thy good pleasure all the world’s afflictions can in no wise dismay me all this however proceedeth from thy power and thy might from thy bounty and thy grace and is not of mine own deserving this is an epistle my god which have purposed to send unto the king thou knowest that have wished of him naught but that he should show forth justice to thy servants and extend his favours unto the people of thy kingdom for myself have desired only what thou didst desire and through thy succour wish for naught save that which thou wishest perish the soul that seeketh from thee aught save thyself swear by thy glory thy good pleasure is my dearest wish and thy purpose my highest hope have mercy my god upon this poor creature who hath clung unto the hem of thy riches and this suppliant soul who calleth upon thee saying “thou art verily the lord of might and glory assist thou my god his majesty thesháh to keep thy statutes amidst thy servants and to manifest thy justice amongst thy creatures that he may treat this people as he treateth others thou art in truth the god of power of glory and wisdom by the leave and permission of the king of the age this servant journeyed from the seat of sovereignty to ‘iráq and dwelt for twelve years in that land throughout the entire course of this period no account of our condition was submitted to the court of thy presence and no representation ever made to foreign powers placing our whole trust in god we resided in that land until there came to ‘iráq certain official who upon his arrival undertook to harass this poor company of exiles day after day at the instigation of some of the outwardly learned and of other individuals he would stir up trouble for these servants although they had at no time committed any act detrimental to the state and its people or contrary to the rules and customs of the citizens of the realm fearing lest the actions of these transgressors should produce some outcome at variance with thy world adorning judgement this servant despatched brief account of the matter to mírzá sa‘ídkhán at the foreign ministry so that he might submit it to the royal presence and that whatever thou shouldst please to decree in this respect might be obeyed long while elapsed and no decree was issued finally matters came to such pass that there loomed the threat of imminent strife and bloodshed of necessity therefore and for the protection of the servants of god few of them appealed to the governor of ‘iráq wert thou to observe these events with the eye of fairness it would become clear and evident in the luminous mirror of thine heart that what occurred was called for by the circumstances and that no other alternative could be seen his majesty himself is witness that in whatever city number of this people have resided the hostility of certain functionaries hath enkindled the flame of conflict and contention this evanescent soul however hath since his arrival in ‘iráq forbidden all to engage in dissension and strife the witness of this servant is his very deeds for all are well aware and will testify that although greater number of this people resided in ‘iráq than in any other land no one overstepped his limits or transgressed against his neighbour fixing their gaze upon god and reposing their trust in him all have now been abiding in peace for well nigh fifteen years and in whatever hath befallen them they have shown forth patience and resigned themselves to god after the arrival of this servant in this the city of adrianople some of the people of ‘iráq and elsewhere inquired about the meaning of the term “rendering assistance unto god” which hath been mentioned in the holy scriptures several answers were sent out in reply one of which is set forth in these pages that it may be clearly demonstrated in the court of thy presence that this servant hath had no end in view but to promote the betterment and well being of the world and if certain of the divine favours which undeserving as may be god hath pleased to bestow upon me be not plain and manifest this much at least will be clear and apparent that he in his surpassing mercy and infinite grace hath not deprived mine heart of the ornament of reason the passage that was referred to concerning the meaning of “rendering assistance unto god” is as follows he is god exalted be his glory it is clear and evident that the one true god—glorified be his mention —is sanctified above the world and all that is therein by “rendering assistance unto god” then it is not meant that any soul should fight or contend with another that sovereign lord who doeth whatsoever he pleaseth hath entrusted the kingdom of creation its lands and its seas into the hands of the kings for they are each according to his degree the manifestations of his divine power should they enter beneath the shadow of the true one they will be accounted of god and if not thy lord verily knoweth and observeth all things that which god—glorified be his name —hath desired for himself is the hearts of his servants which are the treasuries of his love and remembrance and the repositories of his knowledge and wisdom it hath ever been the wish of the eternal king to cleanse the hearts of his servants from the things of the world and all that pertaineth thereunto that they may be made worthy recipients of the effulgent splendours of him who is the king of all names and attributes wherefore must no stranger be allowed in the city of the heart that the incomparable friend may enter his abode by this is meant the effulgence of his names and attributes and not his exalted essence inasmuch as that peerless king hath ever been and shall eternally remain sanctified above ascent and descent it followeth therefore that rendering assistance unto god in this day doth not and shall never consist in contending or disputing with any soul nay rather what is preferable in the sight of god is that the cities of men’s hearts which are ruled by the hosts of self and passion should be subdued by the sword of utterance of wisdom and of understanding thus whoso seeketh to assist god must before all else conquer with the sword of inner meaning and explanation the city of his own heart and guard it from the remembrance of all save god and only then set out to subdue the cities of the hearts of others such is the true meaning of rendering assistance unto god sedition hath never been pleasing unto god nor were the acts committed in the past by certain foolish ones acceptable in his sight know ye that to be killed in the path of his good pleasure is better for you than to kill the beloved of the lord must in this day behave in such wise amidst his servants that they may by their very deeds and actions guide all men unto the paradise of the all glorious by him who shineth above the dayspring of sanctity the friends of god have not nor will they ever set their hopes upon the world and its ephemeral possessions the one true god hath ever regarded the hearts of men as his own his exclusive possession—and this too but as an expression of his all surpassing mercy that haply mortal souls may be purged and sanctified from all that pertaineth to the world of dust and gain admittance into the realms of eternity for otherwise that ideal king is in himself and by himself sufficient unto himself and independent of all things neither doth the love of his creatures profit him nor can their malice harm him all have issued forth from abodes of dust and unto dust shall they return while the one true god alone and single is established upon his throne throne which is beyond the reaches of time and space is sanctified above all utterance or expression intimation description and definition and is exalted beyond all notion of abasement and glory and none knoweth this save him and those with whom is the knowledge of the book no god is there but him the almighty the all bountiful it behoveth the benevolence of the sovereign however to examine all matters with the eye of justice and mercy and not to content himself with the baseless claims of certain individuals we beseech god to graciously assist the king to fulfil that which he pleaseth and verily that which he desireth should be the desire of all the worlds later this servant was summoned to constantinople whither we arrived accompanied by poor band of exiles at no time thereafter did we seek to meet with anyone as we had no request to make and no aim in view but to demonstrate unto all that this servant had no mischief in mind and had never associated with the sowers of sedition by him who hath caused the tongues of all beings to speak forth his praise while certain considerations rendered it difficult to make application to any quarter such steps were perforce taken to protect certain souls my lord verily knoweth what is in me and he beareth witness unto the truth of what say just king is the shadow of god on earth all should seek shelter under the shadow of his justice and rest in the shade of his favour this is not matter which is either specific or limited in its scope that it might be restricted to one or another person inasmuch as the shadow telleth of the one who casteth it god glorified be his remembrance hath called himself the lord of the worlds for he hath nurtured and still nurtureth everyone glorified be then his grace that hath preceded all created things and his mercy that hath surpassed the worlds it is clear and evident that whether this cause be seen as right or wrong by the people those who are associated with its name have accepted and embraced it as true and have forsaken their all in their eagerness to partake of the things of god that they should evince such renunciation in the path of the love of the all merciful is in itself faithful witness and an eloquent testimony to the truth of their convictions hath it ever been witnessed that man of sound judgement should sacrifice his life without cause or reason and if it be suggested that this people have taken leave of their senses this too is highly improbable inasmuch as such behaviour hath not been confined to merely soul or two—nay vast multitude of every class have drunk their fill of the living waters of divine knowledge and intoxicated have hastened with heart and soul to the field of sacrifice in the way of the beloved if these souls who have renounced all else but god for his sake and offered up their life and substance in his path are to be accounted as false then by what proof and testimony can the truth of what others assert be established in thy presence the late ḥájí siyyid muḥammad —may god exalt his station and immerse him in the ocean of his forgiveness and mercy —was one of the most learned divines of his age and one of the most devout and pious men of his time so highly was he regarded that his praise was on every tongue and his righteousness and piety were universally acknowledged yet when hostilities broke out with russia he who himself had pronounced the decree of holy war and who with blazoned standard had left his native land to rally to the support of his faith abandoned after the inconvenience of brief encounter all the good that he had purposed and returned whence he had come would that the veil might be lifted and that which hath ere now remained hidden from the eyes of men be made manifest for more than twenty years this people have day and night been subjected to the fury of the sovereign’s wrath and have been scattered by the tempestuous gales of his displeasure each to different land how many the children who have been left fatherless and how many the fathers who have lost their sons how many the mothers who have dared not out of fear and dread to mourn their slaughtered offspring how numerous those who at eventide were possessed of utmost wealth and affluence and who when morning came had fallen into utter abasement and destitution no land is there whose soil hath not been tinged with their blood nor reach of heaven unto which their sighs have not ascended throughout the years the darts of affliction have unceasingly rained down from the clouds of god’s decree yet despite all these calamities and tribulations the flame of divine love hath so blazed in their hearts that even should their bodies be torn asunder they would not forsake their love of him who is the best beloved of the worlds but would welcome with heart and soul whatever might befall them in the path of god king the breezes of the grace of the all merciful have transformed these servants and attracted them unto his holy court “the witness of true lover is upon his sleeve nevertheless some of the outwardly learned have troubled the luminous heart of the king of the age concerning these souls who revolve round the tabernacle of the all merciful and who seek to attain the sanctuary of true knowledge would that the world adorning wish of his majesty might decree that this servant be brought face to face with the divines of the age and produce proofs and testimonies in the presence of his majesty thesháh this servant is ready and taketh hope in god that such gathering may be convened in order that the truth of the matter may be made clear and manifest before his majesty thesháh it is then for thee to command and stand ready before the throne of thy sovereignty decide then for me or against me the all merciful saith in the qur’án his abiding testimony unto all the peoples of the world “wish ye then for death if ye be men of truth behold how he hath declared the yearning for death to be the touchstone of sincerity and in the luminous mirror of thy judgement it is doubtless clear and evident which people have chosen in this day to lay down their lives in the path of the beloved of the worlds indeed were the books supporting the beliefs of this people to be written with the blood spilled in the path of god—exalted be his glory —then countless volumes would have already appeared amongst men for all to see how we fain would ask is it possible to impugn this people whose deeds are in conformity with their words and to give credence instead to those who have refused to relinquish one jot of their worldly authority in the path of him who is the unconstrained some of the divines who have declared this servant an infidel have at no time met with me never having seen me or become acquainted with my purpose they have nevertheless spoken as they pleased and acted as they desired yet every claim requireth proof not mere words and displays of outward piety in this connection the text of several passages from the hidden book of fáṭimih—the blessings of god be upon her —which are relevant to the present theme will be cited in the persian tongue that certain matters which have ere now been hidden may be revealed before thy presence the people addressed in the aforementioned book which is today known as the hidden words are those who though outwardly known for learning and piety are inwardly the slaves of self and passion he saith ye that are foolish yet have name to be wise wherefore do ye wear the guise of the shepherd when inwardly ye have become wolves intent upon my flock ye are even as the star which riseth ere the dawn and which though it seem radiant and luminous leadeth the wayfarers of my city astray into the paths of perdition and likewise he saith ye seeming fair yet inwardly foul ye are like clear but bitter water which to outward seeming is crystal pure but of which when tested by the divine assayer not drop is accepted yea the sunbeam falls alike upon the dust and the mirror yet differ they in reflection even as doth the star from the earth nay immeasurable is the difference and also he saith essence of desire at many dawn have turned from the realms of the placeless unto thine abode and found thee on the bed of ease busied with others than myself thereupon even as the flash of the spirit returned to the realms of celestial glory and breathed it not in my retreats above unto the hosts of holiness and again he saith bondslave of the world many dawn hath the breeze of my loving kindness wafted over thee and found thee upon the bed of heedlessness fast asleep bewailing then thy plight it returned whence it came therefore in the exercise of the royal justice it is not sufficient to give ear to the claimant alone god saith in the qur’án the unerring balance that distinguisheth truth from falsehood “o ye who believe if wicked man come to you with news clear it up at once lest through ignorance ye harm others and afterward repent of what ye have done the holy traditions moreover contain the admonition “believe not the tale bearer certain of the divines who have never seen us have misconceived the nature of our cause those however who have met us will testify that this servant hath not spoken save in accordance with that which god hath commanded in the book and that he hath called attention to the following blessed verse—exalted be his word “do ye not disavow us only because we believe in god and in what he hath sent down unto us and in what he had sent down aforetime king of the age the eyes of these refugees are turned towards and fixed upon the mercy of the most merciful no doubt is there whatever that these tribulations will be followed by the outpourings of supreme mercy and these dire adversities will be succeeded by an overflowing prosperity we fain would hope however that his majesty thesháh will himself examine these matters and bring hope to the hearts that which we have submitted to thy majesty is indeed for thine highest good and god verily is sufficient witness unto me glorified art thou lord my god bear witness that the heart of the king is in truth between the fingers of thy might if it be thy wish do thou incline it my god in the direction of charity and mercy thou verily art the almighty the most exalted the most bountiful no god is there besides thee the all glorious the one whose help is sought by all concerning the prerequisites of the learned he saith “whoso among the learned guardeth his self defendeth his faith opposeth his desires and obeyeth his lord’s command it is incumbent upon the generality of the people to pattern themselves after him …” should the king of the age reflect upon this utterance which hath streamed from the tongue of him who is the dayspring of the revelation of the all merciful he would perceive that those who have been adorned with the attributes enumerated in this holy tradition are scarcer than the philosopher’s stone wherefore not every man that layeth claim to knowledge deserveth to be believed again concerning the divines of the latter days he saith “the religious doctors of that age shall be the most wicked of the divines beneath the shadow of heaven out of them hath mischief proceeded and unto them it shall return and again he saith “when the standard of truth is made manifest the people of both the east and the west curse it should anyone dispute these traditions this servant will undertake to establish their validity since the details of their transmission have been omitted here for the sake of brevity those doctors who have indeed drunk of the cup of renunciation have never interfered with this servant thus for example shaykhmurtaḍá —may god exalt his station and cause him to repose beneath the canopy of his grace —showed forth kindness during our sojourn in ‘iráq and never spoke of this cause otherwise than as god hath given leave we beseech god to graciously assist all to do his will and pleasure now however all have lost sight of every other consideration and are bent upon the persecution of this people thus if it be inquired of certain persons who by the grace of their lord repose beneath the shadow of thy royal mercy and enjoy countless favours “what service have ye rendered in return for these royal favours have ye through wise policy annexed further territory to the realm have ye applied yourselves to aught that would secure the welfare of the people the prosperity of the kingdom and the lasting glory of the state they will have no other reply than to designate justly or falsely group of people before thy royal presence as bábís and forthwith to engage in massacre and pillage in tabríz for instance and in the egyptian town of manṣúríyyih number of this people were ransomed and large sums were seized yet no account of these matters was ever made in the court of thy presence the reason for which all these things have come to pass is that their persecutors finding these unfortunate ones without protection have forgone more weighty matters and occupied themselves instead with harassing this afflicted people numerous confessions and divers creeds abide peacefully beneath the shadow of thy sovereignty let this people be also numbered with them nay those who serve the king should be animated by such lofty aims and sublime intentions as to continually strive to bring all religions beneath the shelter of his shadow and to rule over them with perfect justice to enforce the laws of god is naught but justice and is the source of universal content nay more the divine statutes have always been and will ever remain the cause and instrument of the preservation of mankind as witnessed by his exalted words “in punishment will ye find life men of insight it would however ill beseem the justice of thy majesty that for the trespass of single soul whole group of people should be subjected to the scourge of thy wrath the one true god—glorified be his name —hath said “none shall bear the burden of another it is clear and evident that in every community there have been and will ever be the learned and the ignorant the wise and the heedless the profligate and the pious that wise and reflecting soul should commit heinous deed is most improbable inasmuch as such person either seeketh after this world or hath forsaken it if he be of the latter he would assuredly have no regard for aught else besides god and moreover the fear of god would deter him from unlawful and reprehensible actions and if he be of the former he would just as assuredly avoid such deeds as would alienate and alarm the people and act in such manner as to earn their confidence and trust it is therefore evident that reprehensible actions have always emanated and will ever emanate from ignorant and foolish souls we implore god to guard his servants from turning to anyone save him and to draw them nigh unto his presence his might in truth is equal to all things praise be unto thee lord my god thou hearest the voice of my lamentation and beholdest my condition my distress and affliction thou knowest all that is in me if the call have raised be wholly for thy sake then draw thereby the hearts of thy creatures towards the heaven of thy knowledge and the heart of the sovereign towards the right hand of the throne of thy name the all merciful supply him then my god with portion of that goodly sustenance which hath descended from the heaven of thy generosity and the clouds of thy mercy that he may forsake his all and turn unto the court of thy favour aid him my god to assist thy cause and to exalt thy word amidst thy creatures strengthen him then with the hosts of the seen and the unseen that he may subdue every city in thy name and hold sway through thy sovereignty and might over all that dwell on earth thou in whose hand is the kingdom of creation thou verily art the supreme ordainer in both the beginning and the end no god is there but thee the most powerful the all glorious the all wise so grossly hath our cause been misrepresented before thy royal presence that if some unseemly act be committed by but one of this people it is portrayed as being prompted by their beliefs by him besides whom there is none other god this servant hath refused even to sanction the commission of reproved actions how much less those which have been explicitly prohibited in the book of god god hath forbidden unto men the drinking of wine and this prohibition hath been revealed and recorded in his book in spite of this and of the fact that the learned doctors of the age—may god increase their numbers —have all prohibited the people from such wretched act there still remain some who commit it the punishment which this act entaileth however applieth only to its heedless perpetrators whilst those noble manifestations of supreme sanctity remain exalted above and exempt from all blame yea the whole creation both seen and unseen beareth witness unto their holiness yea these servants regard the one true god as he who “doeth as he willeth” and “ordaineth as he pleaseth” thus they view not as impossible the continued appearance in the contingent world of the manifestations of his unity should anyone hold otherwise how would he be different from those who believe the hand of god to be “chained up” and if the one true god—glorified be his mention —be indeed regarded as unconstrained then whatever cause that ancient king may please to manifest from the wellspring of his command must be embraced by all no refuge is there for anyone and no haven to hasten unto save god no protection is there for any soul and no shelter to seek except in him the essential requirement for whoso advanceth claim is to support his assertions with clear proofs and testimonies beyond this the rejection of the people whether learned or ignorant hath never been nor shall it ever be of any consequence the prophets of god those pearls of the ocean of divine unity and the repositories of divine revelation have ever been the object of men’s repudiation and denial even as he saith “each nation hath plotted darkly against their messenger to lay violent hold on him and disputed with vain words to invalidate the truth and again “no messenger cometh unto them but they laugh him to scorn consider the dispensation of him who is the seal of the prophets and the king of the chosen ones—may the souls of all mankind be offered up for his sake after the daystar of truth dawned above the horizon of ḥijáz how great were the cruelties which the exponents of error inflicted upon that incomparable manifestation of the all glorious such was their heedlessness that they regarded every injury inflicted upon that sacred being as ranking among the greatest of all acts and constituting means of attainment unto god the most high for in the early years of his mission the divines of that age both christian and jewish turned away from that daystar of the heaven of glory whereupon all people high and low alike bestirred themselves to extinguish the light of that luminary of the horizon of inner meanings the names of all these divines have been mentioned in the books of old among them are wahb ibn ráhib ka‘b ibn ashraf ‘abdu’lláh ubayy and others of their like finally matters came to such pass that these men took counsel together and conspired to shed his pure blood even as god—glorified be his mention —saith “and remember when the disbelievers schemed against thee that they might lay hold upon thee or slay thee or cast thee out and so they schemed and god schemed and god verily is the best of schemers again he saith “but if their opposition be grievous to thee—if thou canst seek out an opening into the earth or ladder into heaven and bring to them sign yet if god wished he could gather them unto true guidance be thou not then of the ignorant by god the hearts of his favoured ones are consumed at the purport of these two blessed verses such established and undisputed facts have been forgotten and no one hath paused to reflect in days past or in this day upon the things that have prompted men to turn away from the revealers of the light of god at the time of their manifestation likewise before the appearance of the seal of the prophets consider jesus the son of mary when that manifestation of the all merciful revealed himself all the divines charged that quintessence of faith with impiety and rebellion eventually with the sanction of annas the most learned of the divines of his day and caiaphas the high priest his blessed person was made to suffer that which the pen is ashamed to mention and powerless to describe the wide world in all its vastness could no longer contain him until at last god raised him up unto heaven were detailed account of all the prophets to be given here we fear that it might lead to weariness the doctors of the torah in particular assert that no independent prophet will come after moses with new law they maintain that scion of the house of david shall be made manifest who will promulgate the law of the torah and help establish and enforce its commandments throughout the east and the west the followers of the gospel likewise hold as impossible that the bearer of new revelation should again shine forth from the dayspring of the will of god after jesus son of mary—peace be upon him in support of this contention they adduce the following verse from the gospel “heaven and earth shall pass away but the words of the son of man shall never pass away they maintain that neither the teachings nor the commandments of jesus—peace be upon him —may ever be altered at one point in the gospel he saith “i go away and come again again in the gospel of john he hath foretold the advent of comforter who shall come after him in the gospel of luke moreover number of signs and portents have been mentioned certain divines of that faith however have interpreted these utterances after their own fancy and have thus failed to grasp their true significance would that thou wouldst permit me osháh to send unto thee that which would cheer the eyes and tranquillize the souls and persuade every fair minded person that with him is the knowledge of the book certain persons incapable of answering the objections raised by their opponents claim that the torah and the gospel have been corrupted whereas in reality the references to such corruption pertain only to specific cases but for the repudiation of the foolish and the connivance of the divines would have uttered discourse that would have thrilled and carried away the hearts unto realm from the murmur of whose winds can be heard “no god is there but he for the present however since the season is not ripe the tongue of my utterance hath been stilled and the wine of exposition sealed up until such time as god through the power of his might shall please to unseal it he verily is the almighty the most powerful praise be unto thee lord my god ask thee by thy name through which thou hast subdued all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth to protect the lamp of thy cause within the globe of thine omnipotence and thy bountiful favour lest it be exposed to the blasts of denial from those who remain heedless of the mysteries of thy name the unconstrained increase then by the oil of thy wisdom the radiance of its light thou verily hast power over all the dwellers of thine earth and of thy heaven implore thee my lord by that most exalted word which hath struck terror into the hearts of all who are in the heavens and on the earth save only those who have taken fast hold of thy sure handle not to abandon me amidst thy creatures lift me up then unto thyself cause me to enter beneath the shadow of thy mercy and give me to drink of the pure wine of thy providence that may dwell within the tabernacle of thy majesty and beneath the canopy of thy favour potent art thou to do what pleaseth thee thou verily art the help in peril the self subsisting king the lamps of equity have been extinguished and the fire of tyranny hath so blazed on every side that my people have been led as captives from zawrá’ to mosul known as ḥadbá’ this is not the first outrage that hath been suffered in the path of god it behoveth every soul to consider and call to mind that which befell the kindred of the prophet when the people took them captive and brought them unto damascus known as fayḥá’ amongst them was the prince of them that worship god the mainstay of such as have drawn nigh unto him and the sanctuary of those who long for his presence—may the life of all else be sacrifice unto him they were asked “are ye of the party of the seceders he replied “nay by the lord almighty we are but servants who have believed in god and in his verses through us the countenance of faith hath beamed with joy through us the sign of the all merciful hath shone forth at the mention of our names the desert of baṭḥá hath overflowed with water and the darkness separating earth and heaven hath been dispelled “have ye forbidden” they were asked “that which god hath made lawful or allowed that which he hath forbidden “we were the first to follow the divine commandments” he answered “we are the root and origin of his cause the beginning of all good and its end we are the sign of the ancient of days and the source of his remembrance amongst the nations they were asked “have ye forsaken the qur’án “in our house” he replied “did the all merciful reveal it we are the breezes of the all glorious amidst his creation we are the streams that have branched out from the most great ocean through which god hath revived the earth and through which he shall revive it again after it hath died through us his signs have been diffused his proofs revealed and his tokens disclosed with us is the knowledge of his hidden meanings and his untold mysteries “for what crime have ye been punished they were asked “for our love of god” he made reply “and for our detachment from aught else save him we have not related his exact words—peace be upon him —but rather have we imparted sprinkling from that ocean of life eternal that lieth enshrined within them that those who hearken thereunto may be quickened and made aware of what hath befallen the trusted ones of god at the hands of lost and wayward generation we see the people in this day censuring the oppressors of bygone ages whilst they themselves commit yet greater wrongs and know it not god beareth me witness that my purpose hath not been to foment sedition but to purify his servants from whatsoever hath prevented them from drawing nigh unto him the lord of the day of reckoning was asleep upon my couch when lo the breezes of my lord the all merciful passed over me awoke me from my slumber and bade me lift up my voice betwixt earth and heaven this thing is not from me but from god unto this testify the dwellers of his dominion and of his kingdom and the inhabitants of the cities of his unfading glory by him who is the truth fear no tribulation in his path nor any affliction in my love for him and in the way of his good pleasure verily god hath made adversity as morning dew upon his green pasture and wick for his lamp which lighteth earth and heaven shall man’s wealth endure forever or protect him from the one who shall erelong seize him by his forelock gazing upon those who sleep beneath the gravestones embosomed in the dust could one ever distinguish the sovereign’s crumbling skull from the subject’s mouldering bones nay by him who is the king of kings could one discern the lord from the vassal or those that enjoyed wealth and riches from those who possessed neither shoes nor mat by god every distinction hath been erased save only for those who upheld the right and who ruled with justice whither are gone the learned men the divines and potentates of old what hath become of their discriminating views their shrewd perceptions their subtle insights and sage pronouncements where are their hidden coffers their flaunted ornaments their gilded couches their rugs and cushions strewn about gone forever is their generation all have perished and by god’s decree naught remaineth of them but scattered dust exhausted is the wealth they gathered dispersed the stores they hoarded dissipated the treasures they concealed naught can now be seen but their deserted haunts their roofless dwellings their uprooted tree trunks and their faded splendour no man of insight will let wealth distract his gaze from his ultimate objective and no man of understanding will allow riches to withhold him from turning unto him who is the all possessing the most high where is he who held dominion over all whereon the sun shineth who lived extravagantly on earth seeking out the luxuries of the world and of all that hath been created upon it where is the commander of the swarthy legion and the upraiser of the golden standard where is the ruler of zawrá’ and where the tyrant of fayḥá’ where are those before whose munificence the treasure houses of the earth shrank in shame and at whose largesse and swelling spirit the very ocean was abashed where is he who stretched forth his arm in rebellion and who turned his hand against the all merciful where are they who went in quest of earthly pleasures and the fruits of carnal desires whither are fled their fair and comely women where are their swaying branches their spreading boughs their lofty mansions their trellised gardens and what of the delights of these gardens—their exquisite grounds and gentle breezes their purling streams their soughing winds their cooing doves and rustling leaves where now are their resplendent morns and their brightsome countenances wreathed in smiles alas for them all have perished and are gone to rest beneath canopy of dust of them one heareth neither name nor mention none knoweth of their affairs and naught remaineth of their signs what will the people dispute then that whereof they themselves stand witness will they deny that which they know to be true know not in what wilderness they roam do they not see that they are embarked upon journey from which there is no return how long will they wander from mountain to valley from hollow to hill “hath not the time come for those who believe to humble their hearts at the mention of god blessed is he who hath said or now shall say “yea by my lord the time is come and the hour hath struck and who thereafter shall detach himself from all that hath been and deliver himself up entirely unto him who is the possessor of the universe and the lord of all creation and yet what hope for naught is reaped save that which hath been sown and naught is taken up save that which hath been laid down unless it be through the grace and bestowal of the lord hath the womb of the world yet conceived one whom the veils of glory shall not hinder from ascending unto the kingdom of his lord the all glorious the most high is it yet within us to perform such deeds as will dispel our afflictions and draw us nigh unto him who is the causer of causes we beseech god to deal with us according to his bounty and not his justice and to grant that we may be of those who have turned their faces unto their lord and severed themselves from all else have seen osháh in the path of god what eye hath not seen nor ear heard mine acquaintances have repudiated me and my pathways have been straitened the fount of well being hath run dry and the bower of ease hath withered how numerous the tribulations which have rained and will soon rain upon me advance with my face set towards him who is the almighty the all bounteous whilst behind me glideth the serpent mine eyes have rained down tears until my bed is drenched sorrow not for myself however by god mine head yearneth for the spear out of love for its lord never passed tree but mine heart addressed it saying “o would that thou wert cut down in my name and my body crucified upon thee in the path of my lord for see the people wandering distraught and unconscious in their drunken stupor they have raised on high their passions and set down their god methinks they have taken his cause for mockery and regard it as play and pastime believing all the while that they do well and that they dwell securely in the citadel of safety howbeit the matter is not as they fondly imagine tomorrow shall they behold that which today they are wont to deny erelong shall the exponents of wealth and power banish us from the land of adrianople to the city of ‘akká according to what they say it is the most desolate of the cities of the world the most unsightly of them in appearance the most detestable in climate and the foulest in water it is as though it were the metropolis of the owl within whose precincts naught can be heard save the echo of its cry therein have they resolved to imprison this youth to shut against our faces the doors of ease and comfort and to deprive us of every worldly benefit throughout the remainder of our days by god though weariness lay me low and hunger consume me and the bare rock be my bed and my fellows the beasts of the field will not complain but will endure patiently as those endued with constancy and firmness have endured patiently through the power of god the eternal king and creator of the nations and will render thanks unto god under all conditions we pray that out of his bounty—exalted be he—he may release through this imprisonment the necks of men from chains and fetters and cause them to turn with sincere faces towards his face who is the mighty the bounteous ready is he to answer whosoever calleth upon him and nigh is he unto such as commune with him we further beseech him to make of this darksome tribulation shield for the temple of his cause and to protect it from the assault of sharpened swords and pointed daggers adversity hath ever given rise to the exaltation of his cause and the glorification of his name such hath been god’s method carried into effect in centuries and ages past that which the people now fail to apprehend they shall erelong discover on that day when their steeds shall stumble and their finery be folded up their blades blunted and their feet made to falter know not how long they shall spur on the charger of self and passion and rove in the wilderness of error and negligence shall either the pomp of the mighty or the wretchedness of the abased endure shall he who reposeth upon the loftiest seat of honour who hath attained the pinnacle of might and glory abide forever nay by my lord the all merciful all on earth shall pass away and there remaineth alone the face of my lord the all glorious the most bountiful what armour hath not been pierced by the arrow of destruction and what regal brow not divested by the hand of fate what fortress hath withstood the approach of the messenger of death what throne hath not been shattered to pieces what palace not reduced to rubble could the people but taste that choice wine of the mercy of their lord the almighty the all knowing which lieth in store for them in the world beyond they would assuredly cease their censure and seek only to win the good pleasure of this youth for now however they have hidden me behind veil of darkness whose fabric they have woven with the hands of idle fancy and vain imagination erelong shall the snow white hand of god rend an opening through the darkness of this night and unlock mighty portal unto his city on that day shall the people enter therein by troops uttering what the blamers aforetime exclaimed that there shall be made manifest in the end that which appeared in the beginning is it their wish to tarry here when already they have one foot in the stirrup look they to return once they are gone nay by him who is the lord of lords save on the day of judgement the day whereon the people shall arise from their graves and be asked of their legacy well is it with him who shall not be weighted down with his burdens on that day the day whereon the mountains shall pass away and all shall gather to be questioned in the presence of god the most exalted stern indeed is he in punishing we beseech god to purge the hearts of certain divines from rancour and enmity that they may look upon matters with an eye unbeclouded by contempt may he raise them up unto so lofty station that neither the attractions of the world nor the allurements of authority may deflect them from gazing upon the supreme horizon and that neither worldly benefits nor carnal desires shall prevent them from attaining that day whereon the mountains shall be reduced to dust though they now rejoice in the adversity that hath befallen us soon shall come day whereon they shall lament and weep by my lord were given the choice between on the one hand the wealth and opulence the ease and comfort the honour and glory which they enjoy and on the other the adversities and trials which are mine would unhesitatingly choose my present condition and would refuse to barter single atom of these hardships for all that hath been created in the world of being but for the tribulations that have touched me in the path of god life would have held no sweetness for me and mine existence would have profited me nothing for them who are endued with discernment and whose eyes are fixed upon the sublime vision it is no secret that have been most of the days of my life even as slave sitting under sword hanging on thread knowing not whether it would fall soon or late upon him and yet notwithstanding all this we render thanks unto god the lord of the worlds and yield him praise at all times and under all conditions he verily standeth witness over all things we beseech god to extend wide his shadow that the true believers may hasten thereunto and that his sincere lovers may seek shelter therein may he bestow upon men blossoms from the bowers of his grace and stars from the horizon of his providence we pray god moreover to graciously aid the king to do his will and pleasure and to confirm him in that which shall draw him nigh unto the dayspring of god’s most excellent names so that he may not give countenance to the injustice he witnesseth may look upon his subjects with the eye of loving kindness and shield them from oppression we further beseech god exalted be he to gather all mankind around the gulf of the most great ocean an ocean every drop of which proclaimeth that he is the harbinger of joy unto the world and the quickener of all its peoples praise be to god the lord of the day of reckoning and finally we beseech god exalted be his glory to enable thee to aid his faith and turn towards his justice that thou mayest judge between the people even as thou wouldst judge between thine own kindred and mayest choose for them that which thou choosest for thine own self he verily is the all powerful the most exalted the help in peril the self subsisting thus have we built the temple with the hands of power and might could ye but know it this is the temple promised unto you in the book draw ye nigh unto it this is that which profiteth you could ye but comprehend it be fair peoples of the earth which is preferable this or temple which is built of clay set your faces towards it thus have ye been commanded by god the help in peril the self subsisting follow ye his bidding and praise ye god your lord for that which he hath bestowed upon you he verily is the truth no god is there but he he revealeth what he pleaseth through his words “be and it is” in his name the all glorious hearken chief to the voice of god the sovereign the help in peril the self subsisting he verily calleth aloud between heaven and earth summoning all mankind unto the scene of transcendent glory neither thy grunting nor the barking of those around thee nor the opposition of the hosts of the world can withhold the almighty from achieving his purpose the whole world hath been set ablaze by the word of thy lord the all glorious word softer than the morning breeze it hath been manifested in the form of the human temple and through it god hath quickened the souls of the sincere among his servants in its inner essence this word is the living water by which god hath purified the hearts of such as have turned unto him and forgotten every other mention and through which he draweth them nigh unto the seat of his mighty name we have sprinkled it upon the people of the graves and lo they have risen up with their gaze fixed upon the shining and resplendent beauty of their lord thou hast chief committed that which hath caused muḥammad the apostle of god to lament in the most sublime paradise the world hath made thee proud so much so that thou hast turned away from the face through whose brightness the concourse on high hath been illumined soon thou shalt find thyself in manifest loss thou didst conspire with the persian ambassador to harm me though had come unto you from the source of majesty and grandeur with revelation that hath solaced the eyes of the favoured ones of god by god this is the day wherein the undying fire crieth out from within all created things “the best beloved of the worlds is come and before all things there standeth moses hearkening to the word of thy lord the almighty the all knowing were we to divest ourself of the mortal raiment which we have worn in consideration of your weakness all that are in heaven and on earth would offer up their souls for my sake to this thy lord himself doth testify none however can perceive it save those who have detached themselves from all things for love of their lord the almighty the most powerful hast thou imagined thyself capable of extinguishing the fire which god hath kindled in the heart of creation nay by him who is the eternal truth couldst thou but know it rather on account of what thy hands have wrought it blazed higher and burned more fiercely erelong will it encompass the earth and all that dwell therein thus hath it been decreed by god and the powers of earth and heaven are unable to thwart his purpose the day is approaching when the land of mystery and what is beside it shall be changed and shall pass out of the hands of the king and commotions shall appear and the voice of lamentation shall be raised and the evidences of mischief shall be revealed on all sides and confusion shall spread by reason of that which hath befallen these captives at the hands of the hosts of oppression the course of things shall be altered and conditions shall wax so grievous that the very sands on the desolate hills will moan and the trees on the mountain will weep and blood will flow out of all things then wilt thou behold the people in sore distress chief we revealed ourself unto thee at one time upon mount tíná and at another time upon mount zaytá and yet again in this hallowed spot following however thy corrupt inclinations thou didst fail to respond and wert accounted with the heedless consider then and call thou to mind the time when muḥammad came with clear tokens from him who is the almighty the all knowing the people were wont to pelt him with stones from hidden places and in the markets and they rejected the signs of god thy lord and the lord of thy forefathers the learned also denied him as did their followers and likewise the kings of the earth as thou hast heard from the tales of old among those kings was chosroes to whom muḥammad sent blessed epistle summoning him unto god and forbidding him from misbelief verily thy lord knoweth all things following the promptings of his evil and corrupt desires however chosroes waxed arrogant before god and tore up the tablet he verily is accounted among the inmates of the nethermost fire was it in pharaoh’s power to stay the hand of god from exercising his sovereignty when he acted wantonly in the land and was of the transgressors from within his own house and in spite of his will we brought forth him who conversed with god well able are we to achieve our purpose recall moreover how nimrod kindled the fire of impiety that its flames might consume abraham the friend of god we delivered him however through the power of truth and seized nimrod with the fury of our wrath say the king of persia put to death the beloved of the worlds to quench the light of god amongst the people and to debar them from the wellspring of life eternal in the days of thy lord the gracious the most bountiful we too have revealed the cause of god in his cities and raised aloft his remembrance amidst them that truly believe in him say this youth hath come to quicken the world and unite all its peoples the day is approaching when that which god hath purposed will have prevailed and thou shalt behold the earth transformed into the all glorious paradise thus hath it been inscribed by the pen of revelation upon this weighty tablet forsake thy mention of the chief pen and call to remembrance anís that intimate of the love of god who severed himself from the wayward and the infidel he tore the veils asunder in such wise that the inmates of paradise could hear them being rent glorified be god the sovereign the powerful the all knowing the all wise nightingale incline thine ear unto the voice of the all glorious on this night when armed troops have surrounded us while we remain in state of utmost joy would that our blood might be shed upon the earth and our bodies cast upon the dust in the path of god this indeed is my desire and the desire of whosoever hath sought me and attained unto my most wondrous mine incomparable kingdom know thou servant that one day upon awakening we found the beloved of god at the mercy of our adversaries sentinels were posted at every gate and no one was permitted to enter or leave indeed they perpetrated sore injustice for the loved ones of god and his kindred were left on the first night without food such was the fate of those for whose sake the world and all that is therein have been created woe betide the perpetrators and those who led them into such evil erelong will god consume their souls in the fire he verily is the fiercest of avengers the people surrounded the house and muslims and christians wept over us and the voice of lamentation was upraised between earth and heaven by reason of what the hands of the oppressors had wrought we perceived that the weeping of the people of the son exceeded the weeping of others—a sign for such as ponder one of my companions offered up his life cutting his throat with his own hands for the love of god an act unheard of in bygone centuries and which god hath set apart for this revelation as an evidence of the power of his might he verily is the unconstrained the all subduing as for the one who thus slew himself in ‘iráq he truly is the king and beloved of martyrs and that which he evinced was testimony from god unto the peoples of the earth such souls have been influenced by the word of god have tasted the sweetness of his remembrance and are so transported by the breezes of reunion that they have detached themselves from all that dwell on earth and turned unto the divine countenance with faces beaming with light and though they have committed an act which god hath forbidden he hath nevertheless forgiven them as token of his mercy he verily is the ever forgiving the most compassionate so enraptured were these souls by him who is the all compelling that the reins of volition slipped from their grasp until at last they ascended to the dwelling of the unseen and entered the presence of god the almighty the all knowing say this youth hath departed out of this country and deposited beneath every tree and every stone trust which god will erelong bring forth through the power of truth thus hath the law gone forth and the command of him who is the ordainer the all wise been fulfilled the hosts of earth and heaven are powerless to resist his cause nor can all the kings and rulers of the world ever frustrate his purpose say adversity is the oil which feedeth the flame of this lamp and by which its light is increased did ye but know indeed the repudiation of the froward serveth but to proclaim this faith and to spread the cause of god and his revelation throughout the world great is your blessedness inasmuch as ye have forsaken your homes and wandered the land for the love of your lord the almighty the ancient of days until ye entered the land of mystery at time when the fire of oppression was ablaze and the croaking of the raven of discord had been raised ye are my partners in my tribulations for ye were present with us during the darksome night in which the hearts of those who testify to the unity of god were agitated ye entered this land for the sake of our love and departed therefrom through our command by the righteousness of god because of you the earth itself glorieth over heaven how excellent is this most sublime this glorious and exalted bounty ye have been deprived of your nest birds of eternity for the sake of your lord the unconstrained but your true abode is beneath the wings of the grace of the all merciful blessed are they that understand mydhabíḥ may the breaths of the spirit waft upon thee and upon such as have sought communion with thee inhaled from thee the sweet fragrance of my presence and hearkened unto that whereby the hearts of the true seekers are sanctified render thanks unto god inasmuch as thou hast attained unto the shores of this most great ocean and give ear to the very atoms of the earth proclaiming “this is the best beloved of the worlds the dwellers of the earth have wronged him and failed to recognize the one whose name they ceaselessly invoke lost are such as have remained heedless and have opposed him for whose loved ones it would have behoved them to offer up their lives how much more for his own luminous and resplendent beauty be thou patient though thy heart be consumed in its separation from god for he hath granted thee an exalted station in his presence nay thou art even now standing before his face and we are imparting unto thee through the tongue of might and power such words as even the ears of the sincere ones have been deprived of hearing say were he to utter but one word that word alone would exceed in sweetness all the sayings of men had muḥammad the apostle of god attained this day he would have exclaimed “i have truly recognized thee thou the desire of the divine messengers had abraham attained it he too falling prostrate upon the ground and in the utmost lowliness before the lord thy god would have cried “mine heart is filled with peace thou lord of all that is in heaven and on earth testify that thou hast unveiled before mine eyes all the glory of thy power and the full majesty of thy law bear witness moreover that through thy revelation the hearts of the faithful are well assured and contented had moses himself attained it he likewise would have raised his voice saying “all praise be to thee for having lifted upon me the light of thy countenance and enrolled me among them that have been privileged to behold thy face consider the people and their condition reflect upon the things that their mouths have uttered and that their hands have wrought in this blessed this most holy and peerless day they that have tarnished the good name of the cause of god and turned unto the evil one are accursed of all created things and are numbered among the inmates of the fire verily whosoever hath hearkened to my call shall remain unperturbed by the clamour of all that are on earth and whosoever is influenced by the words of anyone beside me hath never heard my call by god such man is deprived of entering my kingdom is debarred from my realms of majesty and power and is of them that are in utter loss sorrow not for that which hath befallen thee thou hast borne for my love that which most people have never endured thy lord knoweth and is informed of all he was with thee in the assemblages and gatherings and heard that which flowed from the wellspring of thy heart the living waters of knowledge and wisdom in remembrance of thy lord the all merciful this indeed is token of his bountiful favour erelong will god raise up from among the kings one who will aid his loved ones he verily encompasseth all things he will instil in the hearts the love of his loved ones this indeed is irrevocably decreed by one who is the almighty the beneficent we beseech god to gladden the hearts of his servants through thy call to make thee an ensign of guidance in his lands and to assist through thee those who have been brought low heed not the one who raised loud clamour and he who raiseth it even now let thy lord the ever forgiving the most generous be all sufficient unto thee relate unto my loved ones that which thou hast seen and learned of the tale of this youth and convey unto them that which we have imparted unto thee verily thy lord assisteth and watcheth over thee at all times and under all conditions the blessings of the concourse on high surround thee and the kindred and the leaves of the holy family who circle round the celestial tree extol thee with wondrous praise pen of revelation call thou to remembrance him whose letter reached us during this darksome night he it is who wandered from region to region until he entered the city seeking the shelter of the mercy of his lord the almighty the most high eagerly awaiting the favours of his lord he dwelt therein for night but departed therefrom the following morning as bidden by god filling with sorrow the heart of this youth to this the almighty is himself witness great is thy blessedness for thou hast received the wine of utterance from the hand of the all merciful and became so enraptured by the sweet fragrance of the best beloved as to renounce thy comfort and to be numbered with them that have hastened unto his paradise the dawning place of the signs of thy lord the gracious the peerless happy the one who hath quaffed the wine of inner mysteries from the countenance of his lord and been intoxicated by this pure and crystal draught by god it causeth every true believer to soar in the heaven of majesty and grandeur and transmuteth every doubt into certainty grieve not at what hath befallen thee but put thy whole trust in god the almighty the all knowing the wise raise thy house upon the solid foundation of divine utterances and give praise to thy lord he verily shall suffice thee above all the peoples of the earth god hath in truth inscribed your names upon tablet wherein are enshrined the hidden secrets of all that hath been erelong shall the faithful call to remembrance your exile and all your journeys in his path he verily loveth those who love him and is the helper of the sincere by the righteousness of god the eyes of the concourse on high are fixed upon you and their fingers point towards you thus doth the bounty of your lord encompass you would that the people might recognize that which hath escaped them in the days of god the all glorious the all praised render thanks unto god for having aided thee to know him and to enter within the precincts of his court at time when the ungodly surrounded the family of thy lord and his loved ones and expelled them from their homes with manifest cruelty intending to separate us at the shore of the sea verily thy lord is aware of that which lieth concealed within the breasts of the unbelievers say even should ye tear our bodies asunder ye could not banish from our hearts the love of god we were of truth created for sacrifice and in this do we take pride before all creation thou who art set aglow with the fire of the love of god know thou that thy letter hath reached us and that we have been apprised of its contents we beseech god to confirm thee in his love and in his good pleasure to assist thee in the promotion of his cause and to number thee with such as have arisen for the triumph of his faith as to thy question regarding the soul know thou that among the people there are numerous treatises and manifold views as to its stations among these are the soul of the kingdom the soul of the dominion the celestial soul the divine soul the sanctified soul as well as the benevolent soul the contented soul the soul pleasing unto god the inspired soul the irascible soul and the concupiscent soul every group hath its own pronouncements concerning the soul and we are disinclined to dwell upon the sayings of the past verily with thy lord is the knowledge of the former and latter generations would that thou wert present before our throne to hear from the tongue of grandeur itself that which thou desirest and scale the loftiest heights of knowledge by the grace of him who is the all knowing the all wise the ungodly however have intervened between us take heed lest thou be grieved thereby be content with that which hath been ordained by an irrevocable decree and be of them that endure with patience know that the soul which is common to all men cometh forth following the commingling of things and after their maturation as thou dost observe in the germ once it hath developed to its predestined stage god manifesteth the soul that was latent within it thy lord verily doeth what he willeth and ordaineth what he pleaseth as to the soul which is intended in truth it hath been called forth by the word of god and is such that if it be kindled with the fire of the love of its lord neither the waters of opposition nor the oceans of the world can quench its flame that soul is indeed fire ablaze in the tree of man which proclaimeth “no god is there but him whosoever hearkeneth unto its call is verily of those who have attained unto him and when it casteth off its earthly frame god shall raise it up again in the most excellent of forms and cause it to enter sublime paradise thy lord of certainty hath power over all things know furthermore that the life of man proceedeth from the spirit and the spirit turneth to wheresoever the soul directeth it ponder upon that which we have revealed unto thee that thou mayest recognize the soul of god which hath appeared above the dayspring of bounty invested with manifest sovereignty know also that the soul is endowed with two wings should it soar in the atmosphere of love and contentment then it will be related to the all merciful and should it fly in the atmosphere of self and desire then it will pertain to the evil one may god shield and protect us and protect you therefrom ye who perceive should the soul become ignited with the fire of the love of god it is called benevolent and pleasing unto god but should it be consumed with the fire of passion it is known as the concupiscent soul thus have we expounded this subject for thee that thou mayest obtain clear understanding pen of the most high recount unto him who hath turned unto thy lord the all glorious that which shall enable him to dispense with the sayings of men say spirit mind soul and the powers of sight and hearing are but one single reality which hath manifold expressions owing to the diversity of its instruments as thou dost observe man’s power to comprehend move speak hear and see all derive from this sign of his lord within him it is single in its essence yet manifold through the diversity of its instruments this verily is certain truth for example if it directeth its attention to the means of hearing then hearing and its attributes become manifest likewise if it directeth itself to the means of vision different effect and attribute appear reflect upon this subject that thou mayest comprehend the true meaning of what hath been intended find thyself independent of the sayings of the people and be of them that are well assured in like manner when this sign of god turneth towards the brain the head and such means the powers of the mind and the soul are manifested thy lord verily is potent to do whatsoever he pleaseth all that we have mentioned here hath been elucidated in the tablets we have revealed in response to questions regarding the disconnected letters of the qur’án ponder them that thou mayest comprehend that which hath been sent down from the kingdom of him who is the almighty the all praised thus have we chosen to be concise in this tablet we beseech god to acquaint thee through this brief exposition with that which words can never hope to exhaust and to give thee to drink of the limitless oceans from this cup thy lord verily is the all bountiful and unassailable in his power pen of the ancient of days call thou to remembrance ‘alí he who sojourned with thee in ‘iráq until the daystar of the world departed therefrom he forsook his home to attain the court of thy presence at time when we were captive in the hands of such as have been deprived of the sweet savours of the all merciful grieve not at what hath befallen us and thee in the path of god rest assured and persevere he verily rendereth victorious those who love him and his might is equal to all things whoso turneth unto him brighteneth thereby the faces of the concourse on high and unto this god himself is my witness say people do ye imagine that after rejecting the one through whom the religions of the world have been made manifest ye still bear allegiance to the faith of god by the righteousness of god ye are accounted among the inmates of the fire thus hath the decree been recorded in the tablets by the pen of god say never will the barking of dogs deter the nightingale from warbling its melodies ponder awhile that perchance ye may discover path leading to the eternal truth say magnified art thou lord my god entreat thee by the tears thy lovers have shed in their longing after thee and by the yearning of those who cry out in their separation from thee and by thy best beloved who hath fallen into the hands of thine adversaries to graciously assist those who have sought refuge beneath the sheltering wings of thy favour and loving kindness and who have yearned for no other lord except thee we have forsaken our homes lord in our eagerness to meet thee and in our longing to be united with thee we have traversed land and sea to attain the court of thy presence and to give ear to thy verses when we arrived at the shores of the sea however we were held back from thee as the ungodly intervened between us and the light of thy countenance lord dire thirst hath seized us and with thee are the soft flowing waters of eternal life potent art thou to do what pleaseth thee deny us not the object of our quest write down then for us the recompense decreed for such of thy servants as enjoy near access to thee and are wholly devoted to thy will make us so steadfast in thy love that naught shall keep us back from thee or deter us from thine adoration powerful art thou to do thy pleasure thou verily art the almighty the most generous he is in his own right the supreme ruler thepen of the most high proclaimeth thou who hast imagined thyself to be the most exalted of men and who hast regarded as the lowliest of all creatures this divine youth through whom the eyes of the concourse on high have been illumined and made radiant this youth hath sought nothing from thee or from such as are like unto thee inasmuch as from time immemorial whenever the manifestations of the all merciful and the exponents of his unfading glory have stepped out of the realm of eternity into this mortal world and revealed themselves to revive the dead men such as thee have considered these sanctified souls and temples of divine oneness upon whom must needs depend the rehabilitation of the peoples of the earth to be stirrers of mischief and worthy of blame these men verily have all returned unto dust thou too shalt erelong take abode therein and find thyself in grievous loss even if this lifegiver and world reformer be in thine estimation guilty of sedition and strife what crime could have been committed by group of women children and suckling mothers that they should be thus afflicted with the scourge of thine anger and wrath no faith or religion hath ever held children responsible the pen of divine command hath exempted them yet the fire of thy tyranny and oppression encompasseth all if thou bearest allegiance to any faith or religion then thou shouldst know that according to all the heavenly books and all the divinely inspired and weighty scriptures children are not to be held accountable aside from this not even those who disbelieve in god have perpetrated such unseemly acts since from every thing an effect becometh manifest fact that none can deny save those who are bereft of reason and understanding it is certain that the sighs of these children and the cries of these wronged ones will have their due consequence ye have plundered and unjustly despoiled group of people who have never rebelled in your domains nor disobeyed your government but rather kept to themselves and engaged day and night in the remembrance of god later when the order was issued to banish this youth all were filled with dismay the officials in charge of my expulsion declared however “these others have not been charged with any offence and have not been expelled by the government should they desire to accompany you no one will oppose them these hapless souls therefore paid their own expenses forsook all their possessions and contenting themselves with our presence and placing their whole trust in god journeyed once again with him until the fortress of ‘akká became the prison of bahá upon our arrival we were surrounded by guards and confined together men and women young and old alike in the army barracks the first night all were deprived of either food or drink for the sentries were guarding the gate of the barracks and permitted no one to leave no one gave thought to the plight of these wronged ones they even begged for water and were refused time hath passed and we all remain confined in these barracks notwithstanding that during the five years we dwelt in adrianople all its inhabitants whether learned or ignorant rich or poor bore witness to the purity and sanctity of these servants at the time this youth was departing from adrianople one of the loved ones of god attempted to take his own life so unbearable to him was the sight of this wronged one in the hands of his oppressors during the journey we were thrice compelled to change ships and it is evident how much the children suffered as result upon disembarking four of the believers were separated and prevented from accompanying us as this youth was leaving one of the four named ‘abdu’l ghaffár cast himself into the sea and no one knoweth what befell him thereafter all this is but drop in the ocean of the wrongs that have been inflicted upon us and still ye are not satisfied the officials enforce every day new decree and no end is in sight to their tyranny night and day they conceive new schemes they have assigned each prisoner from the government storehouse daily allowance of three loaves of bread that no one can eat from the foundation of the world until the present day cruelty such as this hath neither been seen nor heard of by the righteousness of him who hath caused bahá to speak forth before all that are in heaven and all that are on earth ye have neither rank nor mention among them that have offered up their souls their bodies and their substance for the love of god the all powerful the all compelling the almighty handful of clay is greater in the sight of god than all your dominion and your sovereignty and all your might and your fortune should it be his wish he would scatter you in dust soon will he seize you in his wrathful anger and sedition will be stirred up in your midst and your dominions will be disrupted then will ye bewail and lament and will find none to help or succour you in making mention of these matters it is not our purpose to rouse you from your slumber since the fury of god’s wrath hath so encompassed you that ye shall never take heed nor is it our intention to recount the iniquities visited upon these pure and blessed souls for they have been so intoxicated with the wine of the all merciful and are so carried away with the inebriating effect of the living waters of his loving providence that even were they to suffer all the cruelties of the world for his sake they would remain content and yield thanks unto him these souls have never held nor shall they ever hold any grievance nay their blood continually imploreth and beseecheth the lord of the worlds that it might be spilt upon the dust in his path and their heads yearn to be borne aloft on spears for the sake of the beloved of hearts and souls several times calamities have overtaken you and yet ye failed utterly to take heed one of them was the conflagration which devoured most of the city with the flames of justice and concerning which many poems were written stating that no such fire had ever been witnessed and yet ye waxed more heedless plague likewise broke out and ye still failed to give heed be expectant however for the wrath of god is ready to overtake you erelong will ye behold that which hath been sent down from the pen of my command have ye fondly imagined your glory to be imperishable and your dominion to be everlasting nay by him who is the all merciful neither will your glory last nor will mine abasement endure such abasement in the estimation of true man is the pride of every glory when was still child and had not yet attained the age of maturity my father made arrangements in ṭihrán for the marriage of one of my older brothers and as is customary in that city the festivities lasted for seven days and seven nights on the last day it was announced that the play “sháh sulṭán salím” would be presented large number of princes dignitaries and notables of the capital gathered for the occasion was sitting in one of the upper rooms of the building and observing the scene presently tent was pitched in the courtyard and before long some small human like figures each appearing to be no more than about hand’s span in height were seen to emerge from it and raise the call “his majesty is coming arrange the seats at once other figures then came forth some of whom were seen to be engaged in sweeping others in sprinkling water and thereafter another who was announced as the chief town crier raised his call and bade the people assemble for an audience with the king next several groups of figures made their appearance and took their places the first attired in hats and sashes after the persian fashion the second wielding battleaxes and the third comprising number of footmen and executioners carrying bastinados finally there appeared arrayed in regal majesty and crowned with royal diadem kingly figure bearing himself with the utmost haughtiness and grandeur at turns advancing and pausing in his progress who proceeded with great solemnity poise and dignity to seat himself upon his throne at that moment volley of shots was fired fanfare of trumpets was sounded and king and tent were enveloped in pall of smoke when it had cleared the king ensconced upon his throne was seen surrounded by suite of ministers princes and dignitaries of state who having taken their places were standing at attention in his presence captured thief was then brought before the king who gave the order that the offender should be beheaded without moment’s delay the chief executioner cut off the thief’s head whence blood like liquid came forth after this the king held audience with his court during which intelligence was received that rebellion had broken out on certain frontier thereupon the king reviewed his troops and despatched several regiments supported by artillery to quell the uprising few moments later cannons were heard booming from behind the tent and it was announced that battle had been engaged this youth regarded the scene with great amazement when the royal audience was ended the curtain was drawn and after some twenty minutes man emerged from behind the tent carrying box under his arm “what is this box asked him “and what was the nature of this display “all this lavish display and these elaborate devices he replied “the king the princes and the ministers their pomp and glory their might and power everything you saw are now contained within this box swear by my lord who through single word of his mouth hath brought into being all created things ever since that day all the trappings of the world have seemed in the eyes of this youth akin to that same spectacle they have never been nor will they ever be of any weight and consequence be it to the extent of grain of mustard seed how greatly marvelled that men should pride themselves upon such vanities whilst those possessed of insight ere they witness any evidence of human glory perceive with certainty the inevitability of its waning “never have looked upon any thing save that have seen extinction before it and god verily is sufficient witness it behoveth everyone to traverse this brief span of life with sincerity and fairness should one fail to attain unto the recognition of him who is the eternal truth let him at least conduct himself with reason and justice erelong these outward trappings these visible treasures these earthly vanities these arrayed armies these adorned vestures these proud and overweening souls all shall pass into the confines of the grave as though into that box in the eyes of those possessed of insight all this conflict contention and vainglory hath ever been and will ever be like unto the play and pastimes of children take heed and be not of them that see and yet deny our call concerneth not this youth and the loved ones of god for they are already sore tried and imprisoned and expect nothing from men such as thee our purpose is that thou mayest lift up thy head from the couch of heedlessness shake off the slumber of negligence and cease to oppose unjustly the servants of god so long as thy power and ascendancy endure strive to alleviate the suffering of the oppressed shouldst thou judge with fairness and observe with the eye of discernment the conflicts and pursuits of this transient world thou wouldst readily acknowledge that they are even as the play which we have described hearken unto the words of the one true god and pride thyself not in the things of this world what hath become of those like unto thee who falsely claimed lordship on earth who sought to quench the light of god in his land and to destroy the foundation of his mighty edifice in his cities where are they to be seen now be fair in thy judgement and return unto god that perchance he might cancel the trespasses of thy vain life alas we know that thou shalt never attain unto this for such is thy cruelty that it hath made hell to blaze and the spirit to lament and hath caused the pillars of the throne to shake and the hearts of the faithful to tremble peoples of the earth incline your inner ears to the call of this wronged one and pause to reflect upon the story that we have recounted perchance ye may not be consumed by the fire of self and passion nor allow the vain and worthless objects of this nether world to withhold you from him who is the eternal truth glory and abasement riches and poverty tranquillity and tribulation all will pass away and all the peoples of the earth will erelong be laid to rest in their tombs it behoveth therefore every man of insight to fix his gaze upon the goal of eternity that perchance by the grace of him who is the ancient king he may attain unto the immortal kingdom and abide beneath the shade of the tree of his revelation though this world be fraught with deception and deceit yet it continually warneth all men of their impending extinction the death of the father proclaimeth to the son that he too shall pass away would that the inhabitants of the world who have amassed riches for themselves and have strayed far from the true one might know who will eventually lay hand on their treasures but by the life of bahá no one knoweth this save god exalted be his glory the poet saná’í may god’s mercy rest upon him hath said “take heed ye whose unseemly conduct hath darkened your faces take heed ye whose beards have been whitened by age alas most of the people are fast asleep they are even as the man who in his drunkenness became attracted to dog took it in his embrace and made it his plaything and who when the morn of discernment dawned and the light of the sun enveloped the horizon realized that the object of his affection was but dog then filled with shame and remorse he repaired to his abode think not that thou hast abased this youth or prevailed over him the least of creatures ruleth over thee and yet thou perceivest not the lowliest and most abject of all things holdeth sway over thee and that is none other than self and passion which have ever been reprehensible were it not for god’s consummate wisdom thou wouldst have been able to plainly behold thine own helplessness and that of all who dwell on earth our abasement is indeed the glory of his cause could ye but understand this youth hath ever been disinclined to breathe word contrary to courtesy for courtesy is our raiment wherewith we have adorned the temples of our well favoured servants otherwise some of the deeds that ye believe to be concealed would have been divulged in this tablet exponent of might and power these young children and these poor ones in god did not need to be accompanied by officers and soldiers upon our arrival in gallipoli major by the name of ‘umar came into our presence god is well aware of what he said after some exchanges in which his own innocence and thy guilt were mentioned we declared “from the outset gathering should have been convened at which the learned men of this age could have met with this youth in order to determine what offence these servants have committed but now the matter hath gone beyond such considerations and according to thine own assertion thou art charged with incarcerating us in the most desolate of cities there is matter which if thou findest it possible request thee to submit to his majesty the sulṭán that for ten minutes this youth be enabled to meet him so that he may demand whatsoever he deemeth as sufficient testimony and regardeth as proof of the veracity of him who is the truth should god enable him to produce it let him then release these wronged ones and leave them to themselves he promised to transmit this message and to give us his reply we received however no news from him although it becometh not him who is the truth to present himself before any person inasmuch as all have been created to obey him yet in view of the condition of these little children and the large number of women so far removed from their friends and countries we have acquiesced in this matter in spite of this nothing hath resulted ‘umar himself is alive and accessible inquire from him that the truth may be made known unto you most of our companions now lie sick in this prison and none knoweth what befell us except god the almighty the all knowing in the days following our arrival two of these servants hastened to the realms above for an entire day the guards insisted that until they were paid for the shrouds and burial those blessed bodies could not be removed although no one had requested any help from them at that time we were devoid of earthly means and pleaded that they leave the matter unto us and allow those present to carry the bodies but they refused finally carpet was taken to the bazaar to be sold and the sum obtained was delivered to the guards later it was learned that they had merely dug shallow grave into which they had placed both blessed bodies although they had taken twice the amount required for shrouds and burial the pen is powerless to depict and the tongue faileth to describe the trials which we have suffered yet sweeter than honey to me is the bitterness of such tribulations would that at every instant all the afflictions of the world could in the path of god and for the sake of his love be visited upon this evanescent soul who is immersed in the ocean of divine knowledge we implore god for patience and forbearance inasmuch as thou art but feeble creature and bereft of comprehension wert thou to awaken and inhale the fragrance of the breezes that waft from the retreats of eternity thou wouldst readily abandon all that thou dost possess and in which thou dost rejoice and choose to abide in one of the dilapidated rooms of this most great prison beseech god to grant thee such mature understanding as to enable thee to distinguish praiseworthy actions from those which merit blame peace be upon him who followeth the way of guidance he is the most holy the most glorious káf ẓá’ we call unto thee from beyond the sea of grandeur upon the crimson land above the horizon of tribulation verily no god is there save him the almighty the most generous walk thou steadfastly in my cause and follow not the ways of those who upon attaining unto the object of their desire denied god the lord of lords erelong shall he lay hold upon them in his wrath and he verily is the all powerful the all subduing know thou that through the power of his sovereign might god hath seized him who was the foremost amongst them that passed judgement against us when he saw his torment approaching he fled to paris to seek recourse to physicians “is there none to help me he asked he was smitten upon the mouth and told “there is no escape and when he turned towards the angel of wrath he well nigh expired from fear “i have house full of riches he pleaded “i have palace on the bosphorus beneath which the rivers flow the angel replied “no ransom shall be accepted from thee on this day even shouldst thou offer up all things visible and invisible hearest thou not the sighs of the kindred of god whom thou didst cast into prison without proof or testimony thy deed hath provoked the lamentation of the inmates of paradise and of those who circle morn and eve round the throne on high the wrath of thy lord hath descended upon thee and stern is he in his chastisement he made reply “i held command over the people and here is the mandate of my authority “hold thy peace denier of the day of judgement he implored “is no respite possible so that may send for my family “far from it disbeliever in the verses of god thereupon the keepers of the fathomless abyss called unto him “the gates of hell have opened wide to receive thee thou who hast turned away from thy lord the unconstrained repair unto its fire for it yearneth after thee hast thou forgotten rejected one when thou wert the nimrod of the age how thy tyranny eclipsed the very cruelties of pharaoh the lord of the stakes by god thine iniquity hath rent asunder the veil of sanctity and caused the pillars of heaven to tremble where canst thou find refuge now who shall protect thee from the dreadful scourge of thy lord the all compelling there is no haven for thee in this day ungodly doubter whereupon the agony of death seized him and he saw no more thus did we lay hold on him in our wrathful anger and severe is thy lord in his punishment then an angel from the right hand of the throne summoned him “behold the angel of affliction is there any place to flee to save hell wherein the heart boileth and the angel of chastisement received his spirit and voice proclaimed “enter the bottomless pit which hath been promised in the book and whose existence thou didst day and night deny soon will we dismiss the one who was like unto him and will lay hold on their chief who ruleth the land and verily am the almighty the all compelling be thou steadfast in the cause of god and extol thy lord morn and eve suffer not the light of thy soul to be quenched by the calumnies of the one who was so blinded by our bestowals as to turn away from god the lord of all names he inspireth his devoted followers even as the evil one prompteth his own erelong shalt thou behold him in evident loss both in this world and in the world to come he indeed is among those whom an afflictive torment doth await he despatched an epistle to someone in that land writ of the workers of iniquity in which he mocked god and recorded that which filled all created things with dismay say canst thou find anyone to protect thee when the wrath of god the all powerful the unconstrained is visited upon thee thus have we informed thee of that which lieth concealed within the hearts of men verily thy lord is the almighty the all knowing arise for the triumph of this cause and gather together my loved ones help them to see the truth in this day when the feet of men have slipped say it behoveth every true believer to assist his lord he verily is your helper while the people have no one to turn to in this day then we seized mihdí to whom we had promised divine chastisement in our books and scriptures when our awful majesty encompassed him he entreated “may not retrace my steps voice exclaimed “woe betide thee disbeliever in the day of resurrection this is the nethermost fire and its flames have been made to blaze for thee thou didst forsake all righteous deeds in thy vain and futile life and now thou hast none to shield thee from god thou art indeed he who caused all hearts to be consumed and the holy spirit to lament he pleaded “is there yet no refuge for me “nay by my lord even shouldst thou seek recourse to every possible means thereupon he cried out in such distress as to cause the people of the graves to tremble and was seized by the hand of invincible power voice then proclaimed “return unto the seat of wrath in the fire of hell wretched and evil be thine abode thus did we lay hold on him as we laid hold on those who preceded him behold their houses which we have left to the spiders and take heed ye who are endued with understanding he it is who opposed god and for whom the verses of wrath were revealed in the book blessed is he who readeth it and pondereth its contents for goodly end doth in truth await him thus have we recounted unto thee the tale of the evil doers that thine eyes may be solaced as for thee there lieth in store naught but blissful end he is the almighty thisis tablet from this servant who is called ḥusayn in the kingdom of names to the concourse of the kings of the earth haply they may approach it in spirit of open mindedness discover from its message the mysteries of divine providence and be of those that comprehend its meaning and perchance they may forsake all they possess turn towards the retreats of holiness and draw nigh unto god the all glorious the incomparable kings of the earth give ear unto the voice of god calling from this sublime this fruit laden tree that hath sprung out of the crimson hill upon the holy plain intoning the words “there is none other god but he the mighty the all powerful the all wise this is spot which hath been sanctified by god for those who approach it spot wherein his voice may be heard from the celestial tree of holiness fear god concourse of kings and suffer not yourselves to be deprived of this most sublime grace fling away then the things ye possess and take fast hold on the handle of god the exalted the great set your hearts towards the face of god and abandon that which your desires have bidden you to follow and be not of those who perish relate unto them servant the story of ‘alí when he came unto them with truth bearing his glorious and weighty book and holding in his hands testimony and proof from god and holy and blessed tokens from him ye however kings have failed to heed the remembrance of god in his days and to be guided by the lights which arose and shone forth above the horizon of resplendent heaven ye examined not his cause when so to do would have been better for you than all that the sun shineth upon could ye but perceive it ye remained careless until the divines of persia—those cruel ones—pronounced judgement against him and unjustly slew him his spirit ascended unto god and the eyes of the inmates of paradise and the angels that are nigh unto him wept sore by reason of this cruelty beware that ye be not careless henceforth as ye have been careless aforetime return then unto god your maker and be not of the heedless say the sun of vicegerency hath dawned the point of knowledge and wisdom hath been made plain and the testimony of god the almighty the all wise hath been made manifest say the moon of eternity hath risen in the midmost heaven and its light hath illumined the dwellers of the realms above my face hath come forth from the veils and shed its radiance upon all that is in heaven and on earth and yet ye turned not towards him notwithstanding that ye were created for him concourse of kings follow therefore that which speak unto you and hearken unto it with your hearts and be not of such as have turned aside for your glory consisteth not in your sovereignty but rather in your nearness unto god and your observance of his command as sent down in his holy and preserved tablets should any one of you rule over the whole earth and over all that lieth within it and upon it its seas its lands its mountains and its plains and yet be not remembered by god all these would profit him not could ye but know it know ye that servant’s glory resideth in his nearness unto god and that unless he draweth nigh unto him naught else can ever profit him even should he hold sway over the entire creation say the breeze of god hath wafted over you from the retreats of paradise but ye have neglected it and chosen to persist in your waywardness guidance hath been given unto you from god but ye have failed to follow it and preferred to reject its truth the lamp of god hath been lit within the niche of his cause but ye have neglected to seek the radiance of its glory and to draw nigh unto its light and still ye slumber upon the couch of heedlessness arise then and make steadfast your feet and make ye amends for that which hath escaped you and set then yourselves towards his holy court on the shore of his mighty ocean so that the pearls of knowledge and wisdom which god hath stored up within the shell of his radiant heart may be revealed unto you such is the counsel that shall profit you most make of it your provision that ye may be of those who are guided aright beware lest ye hinder the breeze of god from blowing over your hearts the breeze through which the hearts of such as have turned unto him can be quickened hearken unto the clear admonitions that we have revealed for you in this tablet that god in turn may hearken unto you and may open before your faces the portals of his mercy he verily is the compassionate the merciful lay not aside the fear of god kings of the earth and beware that ye transgress not the bounds which the almighty hath fixed observe the injunctions laid upon you in his book and take good heed not to overstep their limits be vigilant that ye may not do injustice to anyone be it to the extent of grain of mustard seed tread ye the path of justice for this verily is the straight path compose your differences and reduce your armaments that the burden of your expenditures may be lightened and that your minds and hearts may be tranquillized heal the dissensions that divide you and ye will no longer be in need of any armaments except what the protection of your cities and territories demandeth fear ye god and take heed not to outstrip the bounds of moderation and be numbered among the extravagant we have learned that ye are increasing your outlay every year and are laying the burden thereof on your subjects this verily is more than they can bear and is grievous injustice decide justly between men kings and be ye the emblems of justice amongst them this if ye judge fairly is the thing that behoveth you and beseemeth your station beware not to deal unjustly with anyone that appealeth to you and entereth beneath your shadow walk ye in the fear of god and be ye of them that lead godly life rest not on your power your armies and treasures put your whole trust and confidence in god who hath created you and seek ye his help in all your affairs succour cometh from him alone he succoureth whom he willeth with the hosts of the heavens and of the earth know ye that the poor are the trust of god in your midst watch that ye betray not his trust that ye deal not unjustly with them and that ye walk not in the ways of the treacherous ye will most certainly be called upon to answer for his trust on the day when the balance of justice shall be set the day when unto everyone shall be rendered his due when the doings of all men be they rich or poor shall be weighed if ye pay no heed unto the counsels which in peerless and unequivocal language we have revealed in this tablet divine chastisement shall assail you from every direction and the sentence of his justice shall be pronounced against you on that day ye shall have no power to resist him and shall recognize your own impotence have mercy on yourselves and on those beneath you and judge ye between them according to the precepts prescribed by god in his most holy and exalted tablet tablet wherein he hath assigned to each and every thing its settled measure in which he hath given with distinctness an explanation of all things and which is in itself monition unto them that believe in him examine our cause inquire into the things that have befallen us and decide justly between us and our enemies and be ye of them that act equitably towards their neighbour if ye stay not the hand of the oppressor if ye fail to safeguard the rights of the downtrodden what right have ye then to vaunt yourselves among men what is it of which ye can rightly boast is it on your food and your drink that ye pride yourselves on the riches ye lay up in your treasuries on the diversity and the cost of the ornaments with which ye deck yourselves if true glory were to consist in the possession of such perishable things then the earth on which ye walk must needs vaunt itself over you because it supplieth you and bestoweth upon you these very things by the decree of the almighty in its bowels are contained according to what god hath ordained all that ye possess from it as sign of his mercy ye derive your riches behold then your state the thing in which ye glory would that ye could perceive it nay by him who holdeth in his grasp the kingdom of the entire creation nowhere doth your true and abiding glory reside except in your firm adherence unto the precepts of god your wholehearted observance of his laws your resolution to see that they do not remain unenforced and to pursue steadfastly the right course kings of christendom heard ye not the saying of jesus the spirit of god “i go away and come again unto you” wherefore then did ye fail when he did come again unto you in the clouds of heaven to draw nigh unto him that ye might behold his face and be of them that attained his presence in another passage he saith “when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth and yet behold how when he did bring the truth ye refused to turn your faces towards him and persisted in disporting yourselves with your pastimes and fancies ye welcomed him not neither did ye seek his presence that ye might hear the verses of god from his own mouth and partake of the manifold wisdom of the almighty the all glorious the all wise ye have by reason of your failure hindered the breath of god from being wafted over you and have withheld from your souls the sweetness of its fragrance ye continue roving with delight in the valley of your corrupt desires by god ye and all ye possess shall pass away ye shall most certainly return to god and shall be called to account for your doings in the presence of him who shall gather together the entire creation again heard ye not that which hath been recorded in the gospel concerning those “which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god” —that is those who have been made manifest through the power of god wherefore it becometh evident that one may well be manifested in the world of creation who is truly of god the almighty the all knowing the all wise how is it then that when word reached you of our cause ye failed to inquire from our own lips that ye might distinguish truth from falsehood discover our aim and purpose and learn of the afflictions which we have suffered at the hands of an evil and wayward generation minister of the king of paris hast thou forgotten the pronouncement recorded in the gospel according to john concerning the word and those who are its manifestations and hast thou ignored the counsels of the spirit concerning the manifestations of the word and been numbered with the heedless if not wherefore then didst thou conspire with the minister of persia to inflict upon us that which hath caused the hearts of men of insight and understanding to melt the tears of the denizens of the realm of eternity to flow and the souls of them who are nigh unto god to mourn and all this thou didst commit without seeking to examine our cause or to discern its truth for is it not thy clear duty to investigate this cause to inform thyself of the things that have befallen us to judge with equity and to cleave unto justice thy days shall pass away thy ministry shall come to an end and thy possessions shall vanish and be no more then in the presence of the almighty king thou shalt be called to answer for that which thy hands have wrought how many the ministers who came before thee into this world men who exceeded thee in power excelled thee in station and surpassed thee in wealth and yet returned to dust leaving upon the face of the earth neither name nor trace and are now plunged in grievous remorse amongst them were those who failed in their duty towards god followed their own desires and trod the path of lust and wickedness and amongst them were those who observed that which hath been prescribed in the verses of god judged with fairness by the divine guidance that overshadowed them and entered beneath the shelter of the mercy of their lord admonish thee and those who are like thee to deal not with anyone as ye have dealt with us beware lest ye follow in the footsteps of the evil one and walk in the ways of the unjust take from this world only to the measure of your needs and forgo that which exceedeth them observe equity in all your judgements and transgress not the bounds of justice nor be of them that stray from its path twenty years have passed kings during which we have each day tasted the agony of fresh tribulation no one of them that were before us hath endured the things we have endured would that ye could perceive it they that rose up against us have put us to death have shed our blood have plundered our property and violated our honour though aware of most of our afflictions ye nevertheless have failed to stay the hand of the aggressor for is it not your clear duty to restrain the tyranny of the oppressor and to deal equitably with your subjects that your high sense of justice may be fully demonstrated to all mankind god hath committed into your hands the reins of the government of the people that ye may rule with justice over them safeguard the rights of the downtrodden and punish the wrongdoers if ye neglect the duty prescribed unto you by god in his book your names shall be numbered with those of the unjust in his sight grievous indeed will be your error cleave ye to that which your imaginations have devised and cast behind your backs the commandments of god the most exalted the inaccessible the all compelling the almighty cast away the things ye possess and cling to that which god hath bidden you observe seek ye his grace for he that seeketh it treadeth his straight path consider the state in which we are and behold ye the ills and troubles that have tried us neglect us not though it be for moment and judge ye between us and our enemies with equity this will surely be manifest advantage unto you thus do we relate to you our tale and recount the things that have befallen us that ye might take off our ills and ease our burden let him who will relieve us from our trouble and as to him that willeth not my lord is assuredly the best of helpers warn and acquaint the people servant with the things we have sent down unto thee and let the fear of no one dismay thee and be thou not of them that waver the day is approaching when god will have exalted his cause and magnified his testimony in the eyes of all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth place in all circumstances thy whole trust in thy lord and fix thy gaze upon him and turn away from all them that repudiate his truth let god thy lord be thy sufficing succourer and helper we have pledged ourself to secure thy triumph upon earth and to exalt our cause above all men though no king be found who would turn his face towards thee call thou to remembrance thine arrival in the city how the ministers of the sulṭán thought thee to be unacquainted with their laws and regulations and believed thee to be one of the ignorant say yea by my lord am ignorant of all things except what god hath through his bountiful favour been pleased to teach me to this we assuredly testify and unhesitatingly confess it say if the laws and regulations to which ye cleave be of your own making we will in no wise follow them thus have been instructed by him who is the all wise the all informed such hath been my way in the past and such will it remain in the future through the power of god and his might this indeed is the true and right way if they be ordained by god bring forth then your proofs if ye be of them that speak the truth say we have written down in book which leaveth not unrecorded the work of any man however insignificant all that they have imputed to thee and all that they have done unto thee say it behoveth you ministers of state to keep the precepts of god and to forsake your own laws and regulations and to be of them who are guided aright better is this for you than all ye possess did ye but know it if ye transgress the commandment of god not one jot or one tittle of all your works shall be acceptable in his sight ye shall erelong discover the consequences of that which ye shall have done in this vain life and shall be repaid for them this verily is the truth the undoubted truth how great the number of those who in bygone ages have committed the things ye have committed and who though superior to you in rank have in the end returned unto dust and been consigned to their inevitable doom would that ye might ponder the cause of god in your hearts ye shall follow in their wake and shall be made to enter habitation wherein none shall be found to befriend or help you ye shall of truth be asked of your doings shall be called to account for your failure in duty with regard to the cause of god and for having disdainfully rejected his loved ones who with manifest sincerity have come unto you it is ye who have taken counsel together regarding them ye that have preferred to follow the promptings of your own desires and forsaken the commandment of god the help in peril the almighty say what cleave ye to your own devices and cast behind your backs the precepts of god ye indeed have wronged your own selves and others would that ye could perceive it say if your rules and principles be founded on justice why is it then that ye follow those which accord with your corrupt inclinations and reject such as conflict with your desires by what right claim ye then to judge fairly between men are your rules and principles such as to justify your persecution of him who at your bidding hath presented himself before you your rejection of him and your infliction on him every day of grievous injury hath he ever though it be for one short moment disobeyed you all the inhabitants of ‘iráq and beyond them every discerning observer will bear witness to the truth of my words be fair in your judgement ye ministers of state what is it that we have committed that could justify our banishment what is the offence that hath warranted our expulsion it is we who have sought you and yet behold how ye refused to receive us by god this is sore injustice that ye have perpetrated—an injustice with which no earthly injustice can measure to this the almighty is himself witness have at any time transgressed your laws or disobeyed any of your ministers in ‘iráq inquire of them that ye may act with discernment towards us and be numbered with those who are well informed hath anyone ever brought before them plaint against us hath anyone amongst them ever heard from us word contrary to that which god hath revealed in his book bring forth then your evidence that we may approve your actions and acknowledge your claims had ye wished to deal with us in accordance with your principles and standards it would have behoved you to respect and honour us for complying with your commands and following that which ye have pleased to ordain likewise it would have beseemed you to repay the debts which we incurred in ‘iráq in the execution of your wishes ye should have given ear then unto us heard the account of our woes and judged with equity as ye would judge your own selves ye should not have wished for us that which ye have not wished for yourselves but rather chosen to act with generosity by god ye dealt with us neither in accordance with your own principles and standards nor with those of any man living but in accordance with the promptings of your evil and wayward passions ye concourse of the froward and the arrogant bird of holiness soar in the heaven of communion with me and acquaint the people with that which we disclosed unto thee in the billowing oceans of immortality beyond the mount of glory let the fear of no one dismay thee and put thy trust in god the almighty the beneficent we verily shall protect thee from those who without clear token from god or an enlightening book have grievously wronged thee say god is my witness concourse of the negligent we came not unto you to spread disorder in your lands or to sow dissension amongst your peoples nay rather we came in obedience to the command of the sovereign and in order to exalt your authority to instruct you in the ways of our wisdom and to remind you of that which ye had forgotten—even as he saith in truth “warn them for in truth thy warning will profit the believers but ye hearkened not unto the sweet melodies of the spirit and gave ear unwittingly unto our enemies they who follow the promptings of their corrupt inclinations whose deeds the evil one hath made fair seeming in their own eyes and whose tongues utter calumnies against us heard ye not that which hath been revealed in his all glorious and unerring book “if wicked man come to you with news clear it up at once” wherefore have ye then cast the command of god behind your backs and followed in the footsteps of them that are bent on mischief we have heard that one of these calumniators hath alleged that this servant practised usury whilst residing in ‘iráq and was engaged in amassing riches for himself say how can ye judge matter whereof ye have no knowledge how can ye hurl calumnies against the servants of god and entertain such evil suspicions and how could this accusation be true when god hath forbidden this practice unto his servants in that most holy and well guarded book revealed unto muḥammad the apostle of god and the seal of the prophets book which he hath ordained to be his abiding testimony and his guidance and monition unto all mankind this is but one of the matters in which we have opposed the divines of persia inasmuch as we have according to the text of the book forbidden unto all men the practice of usury god himself beareth witness to the truth of my words “yet hold not myself clear for the soul is prone to evil we intend only to impart unto you the truth that ye might be informed thereof and be of them that lead godly life beware lest ye give ear to the words of those from whom the foul smell of malice and envy can be discerned pay no heed to them and stand ye for righteousness know ye that the world and its vanities and its embellishments shall pass away nothing will endure except god’s kingdom which pertaineth to none but him the sovereign lord of all the help in peril the all glorious the almighty the days of your life shall roll away and all the things with which ye are occupied and of which ye boast yourselves shall perish and ye shall most certainly be summoned by company of his angels to appear at the spot where the limbs of the entire creation shall be made to tremble and the flesh of every oppressor to creep ye shall be asked of the things your hands have wrought in this your vain life and shall be repaid for your doings this is the day that shall inevitably come upon you the hour that none can put back to this the tongue of him that speaketh the truth and is the knower of all things hath testified fear god ye inhabitants of the city and sow not the seeds of dissension amongst men walk not in the paths of the evil one walk ye during the few remaining days of your life in the ways of the one true god your days shall pass away as have the days of them who were before you to dust shall ye return even as your fathers of old did return know ye that am afraid of none except god in none but him have placed my trust to none will cleave but him and wish for naught except the thing he hath wished for me this indeed is my heart’s desire did ye but know it have offered up my soul and my body as sacrifice for god the lord of all worlds whoso hath known god shall know none but him and he that feareth god shall be afraid of no one except him though the powers of the whole earth rise up and be arrayed against him speak naught except at his bidding and follow naught through the power of god and his might except his truth he verily shall recompense the truthful narrate servant the things thou didst behold at the time of thine arrival in the city that thy testimony may endure amongst men and serve as warning unto them that believe we found upon our arrival in the city its governors and elders as children gathered about and disporting themselves with clay we perceived no one sufficiently mature to acquire from us the truths which god hath taught us nor ripe for our wondrous words of wisdom our inner eye wept sore over them and over their transgressions and their total disregard of the thing for which they were created this is what we observed in that city and which we have chosen to note down in our book that it may serve as warning unto them and unto the rest of mankind say if ye be seekers after this life and the vanities thereof ye should have sought them while ye were still enclosed in your mothers’ wombs for at that time ye were continually approaching them could ye but perceive it ye have on the other hand ever since ye were born and attained maturity been all the while receding from the world and drawing closer to dust why then exhibit such greed in amassing the treasures of the earth when your days are numbered and your chance is well nigh lost will ye not then heedless ones shake off your slumber incline your ears to the counsels which this servant giveth you for the sake of god he verily asketh no recompense from you and is resigned to what god hath ordained for him and is entirely submissive to god’s will the days of your life are far spent people and your end is fast approaching put away therefore the things ye have devised and to which ye cleave and take firm hold on the precepts of god that haply ye may attain that which he hath purposed for you and be of them that pursue right course delight not yourselves in the things of the world and its vain ornaments neither set your hopes on them let your reliance be on the remembrance of god the most exalted the most great he will erelong bring to naught all the things ye possess let him be your fear and forget not his covenant with you and be not of them that are shut out as by veil from him beware that ye swell not with pride before god and disdainfully reject his loved ones defer ye humbly to the faithful they that have believed in god and in his signs whose hearts witness to his unity whose tongues proclaim his oneness and who speak not except by his leave thus do we exhort you with justice and warn you with truth that perchance ye may be awakened lay not on any soul load which ye would not wish to be laid upon you and desire not for anyone the things ye would not desire for yourselves this is my best counsel unto you did ye but observe it respect ye the divines and learned amongst you they whose conduct accords with their professions who transgress not the bounds which god hath fixed whose judgements are in conformity with his behests as revealed in his book know ye that they are the lamps of guidance unto them that are in the heavens and on the earth they who disregard and neglect the divines and learned that live amongst them—these have truly changed the favour with which god hath favoured them say wait ye till god will have changed his favour unto you nothing whatsoever escapeth him he knoweth the secrets both of the heavens and of the earth his knowledge embraceth all things rejoice not in what ye have done or will do in the future nor delight in the tribulation with which ye have afflicted us for ye are unable by such means as these to exalt your stations were ye to examine your works with acute discernment neither will ye be capable of detracting from the loftiness of our state nay god will add unto the recompense with which he shall reward us for having sustained with persevering patience the tribulations we have suffered he verily shall increase the reward of them that endure with patience know ye that trials and tribulations have from time immemorial been the lot of the chosen ones of god and his beloved and such of his servants as are detached from all else but him they whom neither merchandise nor traffic beguile from the remembrance of the almighty they that speak not till he hath spoken and act according to his commandment such is god’s method carried into effect of old and such will it remain in the future blessed are the steadfastly enduring they that are patient under ills and hardships who lament not over anything that befalleth them and who tread the path of resignation that which hath befallen us hath been witnessed before ours is not the first goblet dashed to the ground in the lands of islám nor is this the first time that such schemers have intrigued against the beloved of the lord the tribulations we have sustained are like unto the trials endured aforetime by imám ḥusayn for he was approached by messengers from malicious and evil hearted plotters inviting him to come forth from the city yet when he came unto them accompanied by his kindred they rose up against him with all their might until at last they slew him slaughtered his sons and his brothers and took captive the remainder of his family so did it come to pass in an earlier age and god verily is witness unto my words of his lineage there survived none whether young or old save his son ‘alí al awsat known as zaynu’l ‘ábidín behold then heedless ones how brightly the fire of the love of god blazed aforetime in the heart of ḥusayn if ye be of them that ponder so intense grew its flame that fervour and longing at last seized the reins of patience from his grasp and the love of him who is the all compelling so enraptured his heart that he surrendered his soul his spirit his substance and his all in the path of god the lord of the worlds by god sweeter was this in his sight than the empire of earth and heaven for the true lover desireth naught save reunion with his beloved and the seeker hath no goal but to attain unto the object of his quest their hearts long for reunion even as the body yearneth for the spirit nay greater indeed is their longing could ye but perceive it say that same fire now blazeth in mine own breast and my wish is that this ḥusayn may lay down his life in like manner in the hope of attaining unto so august and sublime station that station wherein the servant dieth to himself and liveth in god the almighty the exalted the great were to disclose unto you the mysteries which god hath enshrined therein ye would of truth offer up your lives in his path renounce your riches and forsake all that ye possess that ye might attain this transcendent and all glorious station god however hath veiled your hearts and obscured your eyes lest ye should apprehend his mysteries and be made aware of their meaning say the sincere soul longeth for nearness to god even as the suckling babe yearneth for its mother’s breast nay more ardent is his longing could ye but know it again his longing is even as the panting of one sore athirst after the living waters of grace or the yearning of the sinner for forgiveness and mercy thus do we expound unto you the mysteries of the cause and impart unto you what shall render you independent of all that hath so far occupied you that perchance ye may enter the court of holiness within this exalted paradise swear by god whoso entereth therein shall never abandon its precincts and whoso gazeth thereon shall never turn away therefrom even should the swords of infidels and deniers rain blows upon him thus have we related unto you that which befell ḥusayn and we beseech god that he may destine for us that which he had decreed for him he verily is the most generous the all bountiful by the righteousness of god through his deed the fragrances of holiness were wafted over all things the proof of god was perfected and his testimony made manifest to all men and after him god raised up people who avenged his death who slew his enemies and who wept over him at dawn and at eventide say god hath pledged in his book to lay hold upon every oppressor for his tyranny and to uproot the stirrers of mischief know ye that such holy deeds exert in themselves great influence upon the world of being—an influence which is however inscrutable to all save those whose eyes have been opened by god whose hearts he hath freed from obscuring veils and whose souls he hath guided aright the day is approaching when god will have raised up people who will call to remembrance our days who will tell the tale of our trials who will demand the restitution of our rights from them that without tittle of evidence have treated us with manifest injustice god assuredly dominateth the lives of them that wronged us and is well aware of their doings he will most certainly lay hold on them for their sins he verily is the fiercest of avengers thus have we recounted unto you the tales of the one true god and sent down unto you the things he had preordained that haply ye may ask forgiveness of him may return unto him may truly repent may realize your misdeeds may shake off your slumber may be roused from your heedlessness may atone for the things that have escaped you and be of them that do good let him who will acknowledge the truth of my words and as to him that willeth not let him turn aside my sole duty is to remind you of your failure in duty towards the cause of god if perchance ye may be of them that heed my warning wherefore hearken ye unto my speech and return ye to god and repent that he through his grace may have mercy upon you may wash away your sins and forgive your trespasses the greatness of his mercy surpasseth the fury of his wrath and his grace encompasseth all who have been called into being and been clothed with the robe of life be they of the past or of the future concourse of ministers of state do ye believe in your hearts that we have come to divest you of your earthly possessions and vanities nay by the one in whose hand is my soul our intention hath been to make clear that we oppose not the commands of the sovereign nor are we to be numbered with the rebellious know ye of certainty that all the treasures of the earth all the gold the silver and the rare and precious gems they contain are in the sight of god of his chosen ones and his loved ones as worthless as handful of clay for erelong all that is on earth shall perish and the kingdom will remain unto god the all powerful the incomparable that which perisheth can never profit us nor can it profit you were ye but to reflect by the righteousness of god speak not falsely and utter naught save that which god hath bidden me to this bear witness the very words of this tablet if ye but reflect upon its contents follow not the promptings of your own desires nor the whisperings of the evil one in your souls follow rather the cause of god both in your outward and your inner lives and be not of the heedless better is this for you than all that ye have laid up in your houses and all that ye have sought by day and night the world will pass away and so will all the things whereat your hearts rejoice or wherein ye pride yourselves before men cleanse the mirrors of your hearts from the dross of the world and all that is therein that they may reflect the resplendent light of god this indeed shall enable you to dispense with all save god and to attain unto the good pleasure of your lord the most bountiful the all knowing the all wise we verily have unfolded before your eyes that which shall profit you both in this world and in the realm of faith and which will lead you to the path of salvation would that ye might turn thereunto hearken king to the speech of him that speaketh the truth him that doth not ask thee to recompense him with the things god hath chosen to bestow upon thee him who unerringly treadeth the straight path he it is who summoneth thee unto god thy lord who showeth thee the right course the way that leadeth to true felicity that haply thou mayest be of them with whom it shall be well beware king that thou gather not around thee such ministers as follow the desires of corrupt inclination as have cast behind their backs that which hath been committed into their hands and manifestly betrayed their trust be bounteous to others as god hath been bounteous to thee and abandon not the interests of thy people to the mercy of such ministers as these lay not aside the fear of god and be thou of them that act uprightly gather around thee those ministers from whom thou canst perceive the fragrance of faith and of justice and take thou counsel with them and choose whatever is best in thy sight and be of them that act generously know thou for certainty that whoso disbelieveth in god is neither trustworthy nor truthful this indeed is the truth the undoubted truth he that acteth treacherously towards god will also act treacherously towards his king nothing whatever can deter such man from evil nothing can hinder him from betraying his neighbour nothing can induce him to walk uprightly take heed that thou resign not the reins of the affairs of thy state into the hands of others and repose not thy confidence in ministers unworthy of thy trust and be not of them that live in heedlessness shun them whose hearts are turned away from thee and place not thy confidence in them and entrust them not with thine affairs and the affairs of such as profess thy faith beware that thou allow not the wolf to become the shepherd of god’s flock and surrender not the fate of his loved ones to the mercy of the malicious expect not that they who violate the ordinances of god will be trustworthy or sincere in the faith they profess avoid them and preserve strict guard over thyself lest their devices and mischief hurt thee turn away from them and fix thy gaze upon god thy lord the all glorious the most bountiful he that giveth up himself wholly to god god shall assuredly be with him and he that placeth his complete trust in god god shall verily protect him from whatsoever may harm him and shield him from the wickedness of every evil plotter wert thou to incline thine ear unto my speech and observe my counsel god would exalt thee to so eminent position that the designs of no man on the whole earth can ever touch or hurt thee observe king with thine inmost heart and with thy whole being the precepts of god and walk not in the paths of the oppressor seize thou and hold firmly within the grasp of thy might the reins of the affairs of thy people and examine in person whatever pertaineth unto them let nothing escape thee for therein lieth the highest good render thanks unto god for having chosen thee out of the whole world and made thee king over them that profess thy faith it well beseemeth thee to appreciate the wondrous favours with which god hath favoured thee and to magnify continually his name thou canst best praise him if thou lovest his loved ones and dost safeguard and protect his servants from the mischief of the treacherous that none may any longer oppress them thou shouldst moreover arise to enforce the law of god amongst them that thou mayest be of those who are firmly established in his law shouldst thou cause rivers of justice to spread their waters amongst thy subjects god would surely aid thee with the hosts of the unseen and of the seen and would strengthen thee in thine affairs no god is there but him all creation and its empire are his unto him return the works of the faithful place not thy reliance on thy treasures put thy whole confidence in the grace of god thy lord let him be thy trust in whatever thou doest and be of them that have submitted themselves to his will let him be thy helper and enrich thyself with his treasures for with him are the treasuries of the heavens and of the earth he bestoweth them upon whom he will and from whom he will he withholdeth them there is none other god but him the all possessing the all praised all are but paupers at the door of his mercy all are helpless before the revelation of his sovereignty and beseech his favours overstep not the bounds of moderation and deal justly with them that serve thee bestow upon them according to their needs and not to the extent that will enable them to lay up riches for themselves to deck their persons to embellish their homes to acquire the things that are of no benefit unto them and to be numbered with the extravagant deal with them with undeviating justice so that none among them may either suffer want or be pampered with luxuries this is but manifest justice allow not the abject to rule over and dominate them who are noble and worthy of honour and suffer not the high minded to be at the mercy of the contemptible and worthless for this is what we observed upon our arrival in the city and to it we bear witness we found among its inhabitants some who were possessed of an affluent fortune and lived in the midst of excessive riches while others were in dire want and abject poverty this ill beseemeth thy sovereignty and is unworthy of thy rank let my counsel be acceptable to thee and strive thou to rule with equity among men that god may exalt thy name and spread abroad the fame of thy justice in all the world beware lest thou aggrandize thy ministers at the expense of thy subjects fear the sighs of the poor and of the upright in heart who at every break of day bewail their plight and be unto them benignant sovereign they verily are thy treasures on earth it behoveth thee therefore to safeguard thy treasures from the assaults of them who wish to rob thee inquire into their affairs and ascertain every year nay every month their condition and be not of them that are careless of their duty set before thine eyes god’s unerring balance and as one standing in his presence weigh in that balance thine actions every day every moment of thy life bring thyself to account ere thou art summoned to reckoning on the day when no man shall have strength to stand for fear of god the day when the hearts of the heedless ones shall be made to tremble it behoveth every king to be as bountiful as the sun which fostereth the growth of all beings and giveth to each its due whose benefits are not inherent in itself but are ordained by him who is the most powerful the almighty the king should be as generous as liberal in his mercy as the clouds the outpourings of whose bounty are showered upon every land by the behest of him who is the supreme ordainer the all knowing have care not to entrust thine affairs of state entirely into another’s hands none can discharge thy functions better than thine own self thus do we make clear unto thee our words of wisdom and send down upon thee that which can enable thee to pass over from the left hand of oppression to the right hand of justice and approach the resplendent ocean of his favours such is the path which the kings that were before thee have trodden they that acted equitably towards their subjects and walked in the ways of undeviating justice thou art god’s shadow on earth strive therefore to act in such manner as befitteth so eminent so august station if thou dost depart from following the things we have caused to descend upon thee and taught thee thou wilt assuredly be derogating from that great and priceless honour return then and cleave wholly unto god and cleanse thine heart from the world and all its vanities and suffer not the love of any stranger to enter and dwell therein not until thou dost purify thine heart from every trace of such love can the brightness of the light of god shed its radiance upon it for to none hath god given more than one heart this verily hath been decreed and written down in his ancient book and as the human heart as fashioned by god is one and undivided it behoveth thee to take heed that its affections be also one and undivided cleave thou therefore with the whole affection of thine heart unto his love and withdraw it from the love of anyone besides him that he may aid thee to immerse thyself in the ocean of his unity and enable thee to become true upholder of his oneness god is my witness my sole purpose in revealing to thee these words is to sanctify thee from the transitory things of the earth and aid thee to enter the realm of everlasting glory that thou mayest by the leave of god be of them that abide and rule therein hast thou heard king what we have suffered at the hands of thy ministers and how we have been treated by them or art thou of the negligent if indeed thou hast heard and known wherefore didst thou not forbid thy ministers to commit such deeds how didst thou desire for him who hath complied with thy command and been obedient to thy behest that which no king would desire for any of his subjects and if thou knowest not this indeed is more grievous error wert thou of the god fearing wherefore shall recount to thee that which we have suffered at the hands of these oppressors know then that we came unto thy city at thine own behest and entered therein with conspicuous honour they expelled us however from thy city with an abasement with which no abasement on earth can compare if thou be of them that are well informed they made us journey until we reached the place which none entereth except such as have rebelled against the authority of the sovereign and as are numbered with the transgressors all this notwithstanding that we had never disobeyed thee though it be for single moment for when we heard thy bidding we observed it and submitted to thy will in dealing with us however thy ministers neither honoured the standards of god and his commandments nor heeded that which hath been revealed to the prophets and messengers they showed us no mercy and committed against us that which no one among the faithful hath ever wrought against his fellow nor any believer inflicted upon an infidel god knoweth and is witness unto the truth of our words when they expelled us from thy city they placed us in such conveyances as the people use to carry baggage and the like such was the treatment we received at their hands shouldst thou wish to know the truth thus were we sent away and thus were we brought to the city which they regard as the abode of rebels upon our arrival we could find no house in which to dwell and perforce resided in place where none would enter save the most indigent stranger there we lodged for time after which suffering increasingly from the confined space we sought and rented houses which by reason of the extreme cold had been vacated by their occupants thus in the depth of winter we were constrained to make our abode in houses wherein none dwell except in the heat of summer neither my family nor those who accompanied me had the necessary raiment to protect them from the cold in that freezing weather would that thy ministers had dealt with us according to the principles they uphold amongst themselves for by god they dealt with us neither in accordance with the commandments of god nor with the practices they uphold nor with the standards current amongst men nor even with the manner in which the destitute of the earth receive wayfarer such is the account of what we suffered at their hands and which we have related unto thee in language of truthfulness and sincerity all this befell me though had come unto them at their own behest and did not oppose their authority which deriveth from thine own thus did we accept and observe their bidding they however appear to have forgotten that which god hath commanded he saith and his word is the truth “act with humility towards the believers methinks that their only concern was their own comfort and repose and that their ears were deaf to the sighs of the poor and the cries of the oppressed they seem to imagine that they have been created from pure light while others have been fashioned out of dust how wretched are their imaginings we have all been created from sorry germ swear by god king it is not my wish to make my plaint to thee against them that persecute me only plead my grief and my sorrow to god who hath created me and them who well knoweth our state and who watcheth over all things my wish is to warn them of the consequences of their actions if perchance they might desist from treating others as they have treated me and be of them that heed my warning the tribulations that have touched us the destitution from which we suffer the various troubles with which we are encompassed shall all pass away as shall pass away the pleasures in which they delight and the affluence they enjoy this is the truth which no man on earth can reject the days in which we have been compelled to dwell in the dust will soon be ended as will the days in which they occupied the seats of honour god shall assuredly judge with truth between us and them and he verily is the best of judges we render thanks unto god for whatsoever hath befallen us and we patiently endure the things he hath ordained in the past or will ordain in the future in him have placed my trust and into his hands have committed my cause he will certainly repay all them that endure with patience and put their confidence in him his is the creation and its empire he exalteth whom he will and whom he will he doth abase he shall not be asked of his doings he verily is the all glorious the almighty let thine ear be attentive king to the words we have addressed to thee let the oppressor desist from his tyranny and cut off the perpetrators of injustice from among them that profess thy faith by the righteousness of god the tribulations we have sustained are such that any pen that recounteth them cannot but be overwhelmed with anguish no one of them that truly believe and uphold the unity of god can bear the burden of their recital so great have been our sufferings that even the eyes of our enemies have wept over us and beyond them those of every discerning person and to all these trials have we been subjected in spite of our action in approaching thee and in bidding the people to enter beneath thy shadow that thou mightest be stronghold unto them that believe in and uphold the unity of god have king ever disobeyed thee have at any time transgressed any of thy laws can any of thy ministers that represented thee in ‘iráq produce any proof that can establish my disloyalty to thee nay by him who is the lord of all worlds not for one short moment did we rebel against thee or against any of thy ministers never god willing shall we revolt against thee though we be exposed to trials more severe than any we suffered in the past in the daytime and in the night season at even and at morn we pray to god on thy behalf that he may graciously aid thee to be obedient unto him and to observe his commandment that he may shield thee from the hosts of the evil ones do therefore as it pleaseth thee and treat us as befitteth thy station and beseemeth thy sovereignty be not forgetful of the law of god in whatever thou desirest to achieve now or in the days to come say praise be to god the lord of all worlds dost thou imagine minister of thesháh in the city that hold within my grasp the ultimate destiny of the cause of god thinkest thou that my imprisonment or the shame have been made to suffer or even my death and utter annihilation can deflect its course wretched is what thou hast imagined in thine heart thou art indeed of them that walk after the vain imaginings which their hearts devise no god is there but him powerful is he to manifest his cause and to exalt his testimony and to establish whatsoever is his will and to elevate it to so eminent position that neither thine own hands nor the hands of them that have turned away from him can ever touch or harm it dost thou believe thou hast the power to frustrate his will to hinder him from executing his judgement or to deter him from exercising his sovereignty pretendest thou that aught in the heavens or in the earth can resist his faith nay by him who is the eternal truth nothing whatsoever in the whole of creation can thwart his purpose cast away therefore the mere conceit thou dost follow for mere conceit can never take the place of truth be thou of them that have truly repented and returned to god the god who hath created thee who hath nourished thee and made thee minister among them that profess thy faith know thou moreover that he it is who hath by his own behest created all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth how can then the thing that hath been created at his bidding prevail against him high is god exalted above what ye imagine about him ye people of malice if this cause be of god no man can prevail against it and if it be not of god the divines amongst you and they that follow their corrupt desires and such as have rebelled against him will surely suffice to overpower it hast thou not heard what man of the family of pharaoh believer hath said of old and which god recounted unto his apostle whom he hath chosen above all human beings and entrusted with his message and made the source of his mercy unto all them that dwell on earth he said and he verily speaketh the truth “will ye slay man because he saith my lord is god when he hath already come to you with proofs of his mission and if he be liar on him will be his lie but if he be man of truth part at least of what he threateneth will fall upon you this is what god hath revealed unto his well beloved one in his unerring book and yet ye have failed to incline your ears unto his bidding have disregarded his law have rejected his counsel as recorded in his book and have been of them that have strayed far from him how many those who every year and every month have because of you been put to death how manifold the injustices ye have perpetrated—injustices the like of which the eye of creation hath not seen which no chronicler hath ever recorded how numerous the babes and sucklings who were made orphans and the fathers who lost their sons because of your cruelty ye unjust doers how oft hath sister pined away and mourned over her brother and how oft hath wife lamented after her husband and sole sustainer your iniquity waxed greater and greater until ye slew him who had never taken his eyes away from the face of god the most exalted the most great would that ye had put him to death after the manner men are wont to put one another to death ye slew him however in such circumstances as no man hath ever witnessed the heavens wept sore over him and the souls of them who are nigh unto god cried out for his affliction was he not scion of your prophet’s ancient house had not his fame as direct descendant of the apostle been spread abroad amongst you why then did ye inflict upon him what no man however far ye may look back hath inflicted upon another by god the eye of creation hath never beheld your like ye slay him who is scion of your prophet’s house and rejoice and make merry while seated on your seats of honour ye utter your imprecations against them who were before you and who have perpetrated what ye have perpetrated and remain yourselves all the time unaware of your enormities be fair in your judgement did they whom ye curse upon whom ye invoke evil act differently from yourselves have they not slain the descendant of their prophet as ye have slain the descendant of your own is not your conduct similar to their conduct wherefore then claim ye to be different from them ye sowers of dissension amongst men and when ye took away his life one of his followers arose to avenge his death he was unknown of men and the design he had conceived was unnoticed by anyone eventually he committed what had been preordained it behoveth you therefore to attach blame to no one except to yourselves for the things ye have committed if ye but judge fairly who is there on the whole earth who hath done what ye have done none by him who is the lord of all worlds all the rulers and kings of the earth honour and revere the descendants of their prophets and holy men could ye but perceive it ye on the other hand are responsible for such acts as no man hath at any time performed your misdeeds have caused every understanding heart to be consumed with grief and yet ye have remained sunk in your heedlessness and failed to realize the wickedness of your actions ye have persisted in your waywardness until ye rose up against us though we had committed nothing to justify your enmity fear ye not god who hath created you and fashioned you and caused you to attain your strength and joined you with them that have resigned themselves to him how long will ye persist in your waywardness how long will ye refuse to reflect how long ere ye shake off your slumber and are roused from your heedlessness how long will ye remain unaware of the truth ponder in thine heart did ye notwithstanding your behaviour and the things your hands have wrought succeed in quenching the fire of god or in putting out the light of his revelation—a light that hath enveloped with its brightness them that are immersed in the billowing oceans of immortality and hath attracted the souls of such as truly believe in and uphold his unity know ye not that the hand of god is over your hands that his irrevocable decree transcendeth all your devices that he is supreme over his servants that he is equal to his purpose that he doth what he wisheth that he shall not be asked of whatever he willeth that he ordaineth what he pleaseth that he is the most powerful the almighty if ye believe this to be the truth wherefore then will ye not cease from troubling and be at peace with yourselves ye perpetrate every day fresh injustice and treat me as ye treated me in times past though never attempted to meddle with your affairs at no time have opposed you neither have rebelled against your laws behold how ye have at the last made me prisoner in this far off land know for certainty however that whatever your hands or the hands of the infidels have wrought will never as they never did of old change the cause of god or alter his ways give heed to my warning ye people of persia if be slain at your hands god will assuredly raise up one who will fill the seat made vacant through my death for such is god’s method carried into effect of old and no change can ye find in god’s method of dealing seek ye to put out god’s light that shineth upon his earth averse is god from what ye desire he shall perfect his light albeit ye abhor it in the secret of your hearts pause for but little while and reflect minister and be fair in thy judgement what is it that we have committed that could justify thee in having slandered us unto the king’s ministers in following thy desires in perverting the truth and in uttering thy calumnies against us we have never met each other except when we met thee in thy father’s house in the days when the martyrdom of imám ḥusayn was being commemorated on those occasions no one could have had the chance of making known to others his views and beliefs in conversation or in discourse thou wilt bear witness to the truth of my words if thou be of the truthful have frequented no other gatherings in which thou couldst have learned my mind or in which any other could have done so how then didst thou pronounce thy verdict against me when thou hadst not heard my testimony from mine own lips hast thou not heard what god exalted be his glory hath said “say not to everyone who meeteth you with greeting ‘thou art not believer’ “thrust not away those who cry to their lord at morn and even craving to behold his face thou hast indeed forsaken what the book of god hath prescribed and yet thou deemest thyself to be believer despite what thou hast done entertain—and to this god is my witness—no ill will against thee nor against anyone though from thee and others we receive such hurt as no believer in the unity of god can sustain my cause is in the hand of none except god and my trust is in no one else but him erelong shall your days pass away as shall pass away the days of those who now with flagrant pride vaunt themselves over their neighbour soon shall ye be gathered together in the presence of god and shall be asked of your doings and shall be repaid for what your hands have wrought and wretched is the abode of the wicked doers by god wert thou to realize what thou hast done thou wouldst surely weep sore over thyself and wouldst flee for refuge to god and wouldst pine away and mourn all the days of thy life till god will have forgiven thee for he verily is the most generous the all bountiful thou wilt however persist till the hour of thy death in thy heedlessness inasmuch as thou hast with all thine heart thy soul and inmost being busied thyself with the vanities of the world thou shalt after thy departure discover what we have revealed unto thee and shalt find all thy doings recorded in the book wherein the works of all them that dwell on earth be they greater or less than the weight of an atom are noted down heed therefore my counsel and hearken thou with the hearing of thine heart unto my speech and be not careless of my words nor be of them that reject my truth glory not in the things that have been given thee set before thine eyes what hath been revealed in the book of god the help in peril the all glorious “and when they had forgotten their warnings we set open to them the gates of all things even as we did set open to thee and to thy like the gates of this earth and the ornaments thereof wait thou therefore for what hath been promised in the latter part of this holy verse for this is promise from him who is the almighty the all wise—a promise that will not prove untrue know not the path ye have chosen and which ye tread congregation of my ill wishers we summon you to god we remind you of his day we announce unto you tidings of your reunion with him we draw you nigh unto his court and send down upon you tokens of his wondrous wisdom and yet lo behold how ye reject us how ye condemn us through the things which your lying mouths have uttered as an infidel how ye devise your devices against us and when we manifest unto you what god hath through his bountiful favour bestowed upon us ye say “it is but plain magic the same words were spoken by the generations that were before you and were what ye are did ye but perceive it ye have thereby deprived yourselves of the bounty of god and of his grace and shall never obtain them till the day when god will have judged between us and you and he verily is the best of judges certain ones among you have said “he it is who hath laid claim to be god by god this is gross calumny am but servant of god who hath believed in him and in his signs and in his prophets and in his angels my tongue and my heart and my inner and my outer being testify that there is no god but him that all others have been created by his behest and been fashioned through the operation of his will there is none other god but him the creator the raiser from the dead the quickener the slayer am he that telleth abroad the favours with which god hath through his bounty favoured me if this be my transgression then am truly the first of the transgressors and my kindred are at your mercy do ye as ye please and be not of them that hesitate that might return to god my lord and reach the place where can no longer behold your faces this indeed is my dearest wish my most ardent desire of my state god is verily sufficiently informed observant imagine thyself to be under the eye of god minister if thou seest him not he in truth clearly seeth thee observe and judge fairly our cause what is it that we have committed that could have induced thee to rise up against us and to slander us to the people if thou be of them who are just we departed out of ṭihrán at the bidding of the king and by his leave transferred our residence to ‘iráq if had transgressed against him why then did he release me and if were innocent of guilt wherefore did ye afflict us with such tribulation as none among them that profess your faith hath suffered hath any of mine acts after mine arrival in ‘iráq been such as to subvert the authority of the government who is it that can be said to have detected anything reprehensible in our behaviour inquire for thyself of its people that thou mayest be of them who have discerned the truth for eleven years we dwelt in that land until the minister representing thy government arrived whose name our pen is loth to mention who was given to wine who followed his lusts and committed wickedness and was corrupt and corrupted ‘iráq to this will bear witness most of the inhabitants of baghdád wert thou to inquire of them and be of such as seek the truth he it was who wrongfully seized the substance of his fellow men who forsook all the commandments of god and perpetrated whatever god had forbidden eventually he following his desires rose up against us and walked in the ways of the unjust he accused us in his letter to thee and thou didst believe him and followed in his way without seeking any proof or trustworthy evidence from him thou didst ask for no explanation nor didst thou attempt either to investigate or ascertain the matter that the truth might be distinguished from falsehood in thy sight and that thou mightest be clear in thy discernment find out for thyself the sort of man he was by asking those ministers who were at that time in ‘iráq as well as the governor of the city and its high counsellor that the truth may be revealed to thee and that thou mayest be of the well informed god is our witness we have under no circumstances opposed either him or others we observed under all conditions the precepts of god and were never one of those that wrought disorders to this he himself doth testify his intention was to lay hold on us and send us back to persia that he might thereby exalt his fame and reputation thou hast committed the same crime and for the self same purpose ye both are of equal grade in the sight of god the sovereign lord of all the all knowing it is not our purpose in addressing to thee these words to lighten the burden of our woe or to induce thee to intercede for us with anyone nay by him who is the lord of all worlds we have set forth the whole matter before thee that perchance thou might realize what thou hast done might desist from inflicting on others the hurt thou hast inflicted on us and might be of them that have truly repented to god who created thee and created all things and might act with discernment in the future better is this for thee than all thou dost possess than thy ministry whose days are numbered beware lest thou be led to connive at injustice set thy heart firmly upon justice and alter not the cause of god and be of them whose eyes are directed towards the things that have been revealed in his book follow not under any condition the promptings of thine evil desires keep thou the law of god thy lord the beneficent the ancient of days thou shalt most certainly return to dust and shalt perish like all the things in which thou takest delight this is what the tongue of truth and glory hath spoken rememberest thou not god’s warning uttered in times past that thou mayest be of them that heed his warning he said and he verily speaketh the truth “from it earth have we created you and unto it will we return you and out of it will we bring you forth second time this is what god ordained unto all them that dwell on earth be they high or low it behoveth not therefore him who was created from dust who will return unto it and will again be brought forth out of it to swell with pride before god and before his loved ones to proudly scorn them and be filled with disdainful arrogance nay rather it behoveth thee and those like thee to submit yourselves to them who are the manifestations of the unity of god and to defer humbly to the faithful who have forsaken their all for the sake of god and have detached themselves from the things which engross men’s attention and lead them astray from the path of god the all glorious the all praised thus do we send down upon you that which shall profit you and profit them that have placed their whole trust and confidence in their lord ye divines of the city we came to you with the truth whilst ye were heedless of it methinks ye are as dead wrapt in the coverings of your own selves ye sought not our presence when so to do would have been better for you than all your doings know ye that the sun of vicegerency hath dawned in all truth and yet ye have turned away therefrom the moon of guidance hath risen high in the midmost heaven and yet ye remain veiled therefrom the star of divine bounty hath shone forth above the horizon of eternal holiness and yet ye have strayed far therefrom know ye that had your leaders to whom ye owe allegiance and on whom ye pride yourselves and whom ye mention by day and by night and from whose traces ye seek guidance—had they lived in these days they would have circled around me and would not have separated themselves from me whether at eventide or at morn ye however did not turn your faces towards my face for even less than moment and waxed proud and were careless of this wronged one who hath been so afflicted by men that they dealt with him as they pleased ye failed to inquire about my condition nor did ye inform yourselves of the things which befell me thereby have ye withheld from yourselves the winds of holiness and the breezes of bounty that blow from this luminous and perspicuous spot methinks ye have clung to outward things and forgotten the inner things and say that which ye do not ye are lovers of names and appear to have given yourselves up to them for this reason make ye mention of the names of your leaders and should anyone like them or superior unto them come unto you ye would flee him through their names ye have exalted yourselves and have secured your positions and live and prosper and were your leaders to reappear ye would not renounce your leadership nor would ye turn in their direction nor set your faces towards them we found you as we found most men worshipping names which they mention during the days of their life and with which they occupy themselves no sooner do the bearers of these names appear however than they repudiate them and turn upon their heels thus have we found you and thus have we reckoned up your actions and borne witness to all your doings in this day know ye that god will not in this day accept your thoughts nor your remembrance of him nor your turning towards him nor your devotions nor your vigilance unless ye be made new in the estimation of this servant could ye but perceive it by god the tree of vicegerency hath been planted the point of knowledge hath been made plain and the sovereignty of god the help in peril the self subsisting hath been established fear ye the lord follow not the promptings of your evil desires but keep the law of god all your days renew the rules of the ways ye follow that ye may be led by the light of guidance and may hasten in the path of the true one ye wise men of the city and philosophers of the world beware lest human learning and wisdom cause you to wax proud before god the help in peril the self subsisting know ye that true wisdom is to fear god to know him and to recognize his manifestations this wisdom however can be attained only by those who detach themselves from the world and who walk in the ways of the good pleasure of their lord are ye possessed of greater wisdom than the one who contrived moon which would rise from one well and set in another and whose light was visible at distance of three leagues god verily blotted out every trace of his works and returned him unto dust as ye have already heard or are now informed how many the sages and philosophers who equalled or surpassed him in learning and wisdom and how vast the number of those who equalled or surpassed yourselves some of them believed in god while others disbelieved and joined partners with him the latter were at last cast into the fire there to take up their abode while the former returned unto the mercy of their lord therein to abide for god doth not ask you of your sciences but of your faith and of your conduct are ye greater in wisdom than the one who brought you into being who fashioned the heavens and all that they contain the earth and all that dwell upon it gracious god true wisdom is his all creation and its empire are his he bestoweth his wisdom upon whomsoever he chooseth amongst men and withholdeth it from whomsoever he desireth he in truth is the bestower and the withholder and he verily is the all bountiful the all wise ye learned of the world ye failed to seek our presence that ye might hearken unto the sweet melodies of the spirit and perceive that which god in his bounty hath pleased to bestow upon me verily this grace hath now escaped you did ye but know had ye sought our presence we would have imparted unto you knowledge that would have rendered you independent of all else but this ye failed to do and thus hath the decree of god been fulfilled now have been forbidden to disclose it since we stand accused of sorcery if ye perceive our meaning the same words were uttered by the deniers of old men whom death hath long since overtaken and who now dwell in the fire bewailing their plight the deniers of this day shall likewise meet their doom such is the irrevocable decree of him who is the all powerful the self sufficient counsel you in the end not to overstep the bounds of god nor to heed the ways and habits of men for these can neither “fatten nor appease your hunger” fix rather your gaze upon the precepts of god whosoever desireth let him accept this counsel as path leading unto his lord and whosoever desireth let him return to his own idle imaginings my lord verily is independent above all who are in the heavens and on the earth and above all that they say and do close with these words uttered by god exalted be his glory “say not to everyone who meeteth you with greeting ‘thou art not believer’ peace be upon you concourse of the faithful and praise be to god the lord of the worlds footnotes mírzá yaḥyá the báb peter the sulṭán of

library you are free to use its content subject to the terms of use found atwww bahai org legal last modified august gmt bahá’u’lláh from the birth of the bahá’í revelation in subterranean dungeon in ṭihrán where its author was confined in the faith of bahá’u’lláh has rapidly grown in ever widening circles beyond the social and religious matrix of its inception among the first individuals outside the islamic community to be attracted to its teachings presaging the flow of people of all faiths and origins into its universal embrace were zoroastrians in persia and india to this group bahá’u’lláh addressed number of tablets several of which are presented here for the first time in full authorized translations prominent among these works is bahá’u’lláh’s tablet to mánikchí ṣáḥib mánikchí limjí hataria also known as mánikchí manekji ṣáḥib was born in india of zoroastrian parents an able diplomat and devoted adherent of his ancestral religion mánikchí ṣáḥib was appointed in as an emissary on behalf of the parsees of india to assist their coreligionists in iran who were suffering under the repressive policies of the qájár monarchs some time after this he attained the presence of bahá’u’lláh in baghdad although maintaining to the end of his life allegiance to his zoroastrian faith he was attracted to the teachings of the new religion and moved by the sacrifice of its early martyrs became lifelong admirer years after their meeting he posed series of questions to bahá’u’lláh which led to the revelation of two tablets of far reaching significance the first of which was sent to him in the first tablet known as the lawḥ mánikchí ṣáḥib is celebrated for its striking and well known passages epitomizing the universality of bahá’u’lláh’s prophetic claim revealed at mánikchí ṣáḥib’s bold request in pure persian the tablet responds to the questions he had raised and proclaims some of the central tenets of the faith of bahá’u’lláh “be anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye live in and centre your deliberations on its exigencies and requirements “turn your faces from the darkness of estrangement to the effulgent light of the daystar of unity “ye are the fruits of one tree and the leaves of one branch hatsoever leadeth to the decline of ignorance and the increase of knowledge hath been and will ever remain approved in the sight of the lord of creation as inferred from the contents of second tablet mánikchí ṣáḥib was not entirely satisfied with this reply having anticipated more expansive discussion of his specific questions bahá’u’lláh’s further reply is contained in lengthy tablet revealed on sha‘bán july in the voice of his amanuensis mírzá áqá ján the tablet is addressed to the eminent bahá’í scholar abu’l faḍl who at the time was employed as the personal secretary of mánikchí ṣáḥib but lengthy portion of it addresses the latter’s questions bahá’u’lláh states at the outset that he had “failed to consider the matter closely for otherwise he would have readily admitted that not single point was omitted” and explains that out of wisdom his questions had not been directly answered but that even so “the answers were provided in language of marvellous concision and clarity” throughout the remainder of the tablet the text of each of mánikchí ṣáḥib’s questions is successively quoted and detailed replies are given to each in some cases connecting the questions to the universal principles enunciated in the first tablet the tablet is noteworthy for its discussion of range of questions regarding the tenets of both abrahamic and non abrahamic religions as understood by mánikchí ṣáḥib including the nature of creation the connection between faith and reason the reconciliation of the differences that exist among the laws and ordinances of various religions their respective claims to exclusivity and their differing degrees of eagerness to welcome others into their fold bahá’u’lláh’s responses emphasize that which is right and true in the various doctrines and beliefs under examination rather than discarding them outright for inaccuracy or insufficiency included here as well with these two major works are the lawḥ haft pursish tablet of the seven questions addressed to ustád javán mard prominent early bahá’í of zoroastrian background and former student of mánikchí ṣáḥib and two other tablets also revealed to believers of the same origin together these five tablets offer glimpse of bahá’u’lláh’s love for and special relationship with the followers of religion that had arisen many centuries before in the same land that witnessed the birth of his own faith portion of the lawḥ mánikchí ṣáḥib and several excerpts from the other tablets were previously translated by shoghi effendi these have been incorporated into the text of the translations and listed in the appendix it is hoped that the publication of this volume will enable deeper appreciation of the fundamental principle of the oneness of religion and lend fresh impetus to the efforts of those who strive to promote its understanding in an age that needs it more acutely with every passing day in the name of the one true god praisebe to the all perceiving the ever abiding lord who from dewdrop out of the ocean of his grace hath reared the firmament of existence adorned it with the stars of knowledge and admitted man into the lofty court of insight and understanding this dewdrop which is the primal word of god is at times called the water of life inasmuch as it quickeneth with the waters of knowledge them that have perished in the wilderness of ignorance again it is called the primal light light born of the sun of divine knowledge through whose effulgence the first stirrings of existence were made plain and manifest such manifestations are the expressions of the grace of him who is the peerless the all wise he it is who knoweth and bestoweth all he it is who transcendeth all that hath been said or heard his knowledge will remain forever above the grasp of human vision and understanding and beyond the reach of human words and deeds to the truth of this utterance existence itself and all that hath appeared therefrom bear eloquent testimony it is clear and evident therefore that the first bestowal of god is the word and its discoverer and recipient is the power of understanding this word is the foremost instructor in the school of existence and the revealer of him who is the almighty all that is seen is visible only through the light of its wisdom all that is manifest is but token of its knowledge all names are but its name and the beginning and end of all matters must needs depend upon it thy letter hath reached this captive of the world in his prison it brought joy strengthened the ties of friendship and renewed the memory of bygone days praise be to the lord of creation who granted us the favour of meeting in the arabian land wherein we visited and held converse it is our hope that our encounter may never be forgotten nor effaced from the heart by the passage of time but rather that out of the seeds thus sown the sweet herbs of friendship may spring forth and remain forever fresh and verdant for all to behold as to thy question concerning the heavenly scriptures the all knowing physician hath his finger on the pulse of mankind he perceiveth the disease and prescribeth in his unerring wisdom the remedy every age hath its own problem and every soul its particular aspiration the remedy the world needeth in its present day afflictions can never be the same as that which subsequent age may require be anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye live in and centre your deliberations on its exigencies and requirements we can well perceive how the whole human race is encompassed with great with incalculable afflictions we see it languishing on its bed of sickness sore tried and disillusioned they that are intoxicated by self conceit have interposed themselves between it and the divine and infallible physician witness how they have entangled all men themselves included in the mesh of their devices they can neither discover the cause of the disease nor have they any knowledge of the remedy they have conceived the straight to be crooked and have imagined their friend an enemy incline your ears to the sweet melody of this prisoner arise and lift up your voices that haply they that are fast asleep may be awakened say ye who are as dead the hand of divine bounty proffereth unto you the water of life hasten and drink your fill whoso hath been reborn in this day shall never die whoso remaineth dead shall never live thou hast written concerning languages both arabic and persian are laudable that which is desired of language is that it convey the intent of the speaker and either language can serve this purpose and since in this day the orb of divine knowledge hath risen in the firmament of persia that tongue deserveth every praise friend when the primal word appeared amongst men in these latter days number of heavenly souls recognized the voice of the beloved and bore allegiance unto it whilst others finding the deeds of some to be at variance with their words remained far removed from the spreading rays of the sun of divine knowledge say children of dust he who is the spirit of purity saith in this glorious day whatsoever can purge you from defilement and ensure your peace and tranquillity that indeed is the straight path the path that leadeth unto me to be purged from defilement is to be cleansed of that which is injurious to man and detracteth from his high station—among which is to take undue pleasure in one’s own words and deeds however worthy they may be true peace and tranquillity will only be realized when every soul will have become the well wisher of all mankind he who is the all knowing beareth me witness were the peoples of the world to grasp the true significance of the words of god they would never be deprived of their portion of the ocean of his bounty in the firmament of truth there hath never been nor will there ever be brighter star than this the first utterance of him who is the all wise is this children of dust turn your faces from the darkness of estrangement to the effulgent light of the daystar of unity this is that which above all else will benefit the peoples of the earth friend upon the tree of utterance there hath never been nor shall there ever be fairer leaf and beneath the ocean of knowledge no pearl more wondrous can ever be found children of understanding if the eyelid however delicate can deprive man’s outer eye from beholding the world and all that is therein consider then what would be wrought if the veil of covetousness were to descend upon his inner eye say people the darkness of greed and envy becloudeth the radiance of the soul even as the clouds obstruct the light of the sun should anyone hearken unto this utterance with discerning ear he will unfurl the wings of detachment and soar effortlessly in the atmosphere of true understanding at time when darkness had encompassed the world the ocean of divine favour surged and his light was made manifest that the doings of men might be laid bare this verily is that light which hath been foretold in the heavenly scriptures should the almighty so please the hearts of all men will be purged and purified through his goodly utterance and the light of unity will shed its radiance upon every soul and revive the whole earth people words must be supported by deeds for deeds are the true test of words without the former the latter can never quench the thirst of the yearning soul nor unlock the portals of vision before the eyes of the blind the lord of celestial wisdom saith harsh word is even as sword thrust gentle word as milk the latter leadeth the children of men unto knowledge and conferreth upon them true distinction the tongue of wisdom proclaimeth he that hath me not is bereft of all things turn ye away from all that is on earth and seek none else but me am the sun of wisdom and the ocean of knowledge cheer the faint and revive the dead am the guiding light that illumineth the way am the royal falcon on the arm of the almighty unfold the drooping wings of every broken bird and start it on its flight the incomparable friend saith the path to freedom hath been outstretched hasten ye thereunto the wellspring of wisdom is overflowing quaff ye therefrom say well beloved ones the tabernacle of unity hath been raised regard ye not one another as strangers ye are the fruits of one tree and the leaves of one branch verily say whatsoever leadeth to the decline of ignorance and the increase of knowledge hath been and will ever remain approved in the sight of the lord of creation say people walk ye neath the shadow of justice and truthfulness and seek ye shelter within the tabernacle of unity say ye that have eyes to see the past is the mirror of the future gaze ye therein and be apprised thereof perchance ye may be aided thereby to recognize the friend and may be not the cause of his displeasure in this day the choicest fruit of the tree of knowledge is that which serveth the welfare of humanity and safeguardeth its interests say the tongue hath been created to bear witness to my truth defile it not with falsehood the heart is the treasury of my mystery surrender it not into the hand of covetous desires we fain would hope that in this resplendent morn when the effulgent rays of the sun of divine knowledge have enveloped the whole earth we may all attain unto the good pleasure of the friend and drink our fill from the ocean of his recognition friend as hearing ears are scarce to find the pen hath for some time remained silent in its quarters in truth matters have come to such pass that silence hath taken precedence over utterance and hath come to be regarded as preferable say people these words are being uttered in due measure that the newly born may thrive and the tender shoot flourish milk should be given in suitable proportion that the children of the world may attain to the station of maturity and abide in the court of oneness friend we came upon pure soil and sowed therein the seeds of true understanding let it now be seen what the rays of the sun will do—whether they will cause these seeds to wither or to grow say through the ascendancy of god the all knowing the incomparable the luminary of divine understanding hath in this day risen from behind the veil of the spirit and the birds of every meadow are intoxicated with the wine of knowledge and exhilarated with the remembrance of the friend well is it with them that discover and hasten unto him inregard to what thou hast written concerning his honour the learned ṣáḥib upon him be the grace of god his state of mind and disposition are clear and evident as is further attested by that which he hath sent now as to his questions it was not deemed advisable to refer and reply to each one individually for the response would have run counter to wisdom and been incompatible with that which is current amongst men even so in that which was revealed in his honour from the heaven of divine favour answers were provided in language of marvellous concision and clarity but it appeareth that he hath failed to consider the matter closely for otherwise he would have readily admitted that not single point was omitted and would have exclaimed “this is naught but clear and conclusive utterance his questions were the following first “the prophets of mahábád together with zoroaster were twenty eight in number each one of them sought to exalt rather than abrogate the faith and religion of the others each one that appeared bore witness to the truth and veracity of the former law and religion and breathed no word about abolishing them each declared ‘we are the bearers of revelation from god which we deliver unto his servants some of the hindu prophets however have declared ‘we are god himself and it is incumbent upon the entire creation to bear allegiance unto us whensoever conflict and dissension appear amongst men we arise to quench it each one that appeared announced ‘i am the same one that appeared in the beginning the latter prophets such as david abraham moses and jesus confirmed the truth of the prophets gone before them but said ‘such was the law in the past but in this day the law is that which proclaim the arabian prophet however hath said ‘through my appearance every law hath proven to be unsound and no law holdeth but mine which of these creeds is acceptable and which of these leaders is to be preferred it should first be noted that in one sense the stations of the prophets of god differ one from another for instance consider moses he brought forth book and established ordinances whilst number of the prophets and messengers who arose after him were charged with the promulgation of his laws insofar as they remained consonant with the needs of the age the books and chronicles annexed to the torah bear eloquent testimony to this truth regarding the statement ascribed to the author of the qur’án “through my appearance every law and religion hath proven to be unsound and no law holdeth but mine” no such words were ever uttered by that source and fount of divine wisdom nay rather he confirmed that which had been sent down before from the empyrean of the divine will unto the prophets and messengers of god he saith exalted be his utterance “alif lám mím god there is no god but him the living the ever abiding he it is who hath sent down to thee the book through the power of truth confirming those which preceded it he revealed aforetime the torah and the evangel as guidance unto men and he hath now revealed the qur’án… he moreover hath asserted that all the prophets have proceeded from god and have returned unto him viewed in this light they are all as one and the same being inasmuch as they have not uttered word brought message or revealed cause of their own accord nay all that they have said hath proceeded from the one true god exalted be his glory they have all summoned men unto the supreme horizon and imparted the tidings of eternal life thus the diverse statements recounted by his honour the ṣáḥib are to be seen as concordant letters that is letters that form single word concerning the question “which of these creeds is acceptable and which of these leaders is to be preferred this is the station wherein the following blessed words shine resplendent as the sun “no distinction do we make between any of the messengers” while the verse “some of the apostles we have caused to excel the others” pertaineth to the other station of which we have already made mention indeed the answer to all that his honour the ṣáḥib hath asked lieth enshrined within this all embracing this weighty and incomparable utterance hallowed and exalted be his word “as to thy question concerning the heavenly scriptures the all knowing physician hath his finger on the pulse of mankind he perceiveth the disease and prescribeth in his unerring wisdom the remedy every age hath its own problem and every soul its particular aspiration the remedy the world needeth in its present day afflictions can never be the same as that which subsequent age may require be anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye live in and centre your deliberations on its exigencies and requirements every fair minded soul will testify that these words are to be viewed as mirror of the knowledge of god wherein all that hath been inquired is clearly and conspicuously reflected blessed is he who hath been endowed with seeing eyes by god the all knowing the all wise another question raised by the distinguished ṣáḥib is the following “there are four schools of thought in the world one school affirmeth that all the visible worlds from atoms to suns constitute god himself and that naught can be seen but him another school claimeth that god is that essence that must of necessity exist that his messengers are the intermediaries between him and his creatures and that their mission is to lead humanity unto him yet another school holdeth that the stars were created by the necessary being whilst all other things are their effect and outcome these things continually appear and disappear even as the minute creatures that are generated in pool of water further school maintaineth that the necessary being hath fashioned nature through whose effect and agency all things from atoms to suns appear and disappear without beginning or end what need then for an account or reckoning as the grass groweth with the coming of the rain and vanisheth thereafter so it is with all things if the prophets and the kings have instituted laws and ordinances the proponents of this school argue this hath merely been for the sake of preserving the civil order and regulating human society the prophets and the kings however have acted in different ways the former have said ‘god hath spoken thus’ that the people might submit and obey whilst the latter have resorted to the sword and the cannon which of these four schools is approved in the sight of god the answer to all this falleth under the purview of the first utterance that hath streamed forth from the tongue of the all merciful by god it embraceth and comprehendeth all that hath been mentioned he saith “be anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye live in and centre your deliberations on its exigencies and requirements” for in this day he who is the lord of revelation hath appeared and he who spoke on sinai is calling aloud whatsoever he may ordain is the surest foundation for the mansions reared in the cities of human knowledge and wisdom whoso holdeth fast unto it will be reckoned in the eyes of the almighty among them that are endued with insight these sublime words have streamed forth from the pen of the most high he saith exalted be his glory “this is the day of vision for the countenance of god is shining resplendent above the horizon of manifestation this is the day of hearing for the call of god hath been raised it behoveth everyone in this day to uphold and proclaim that which hath been revealed by him who is the author of all scripture the dayspring of revelation the fount of knowledge and the source of divine wisdom it is thus clear and evident that the reply to his question hath been revealed in the kingdom of utterance by him who is the exponent of the knowledge of the all merciful happy are they that understand as to the four schools mentioned above it is clear and evident that the second standeth closer to righteousness for the apostles and messengers of god have ever been the channels of his abounding grace and whatsoever man hath received from god hath been through the intermediary of those embodiments of holiness and essences of detachment those repositories of his knowledge and exponents of his cause one can however provide justification for the tenets of the other schools for in sense all things have ever been and shall ever remain the manifestations of the names and attributes of god as to the ṣáḥib’s reference to the kings they are indeed the manifestations of the name of god “the almighty” and the revealers of his name “the all powerful” the vesture that beseemeth their glorious temples is justice should they become adorned therewith mankind will partake of perfect tranquillity and infinite blessings whoso hath quaffed of the wine of divine knowledge will indeed be able to answer such questions with clear and perspicuous proofs from the world without and with manifest and luminous evidences from the world within different cause however hath appeared in this day and different discourse is required indeed with the inception of the year nine the time for questions and answers came to an end thus he hallowed and magnified be his name saith “this is not the day for any man to question his lord when thou hearest the call of god voiced by him who is the dayspring of grandeur cry out ‘here am lord of all names here am maker of the heavens testify that thou hast revealed thyself and hast revealed whatsoever thou didst desire at thine own behest thou in truth art the lord of strength and might ’” the answer to all that the distinguished ṣáḥib hath asked is clear and evident the intent of that which was sent down in his honour from the heaven of divine providence was that he might give ear to the wondrous melodies of the dove of eternity and the gentle murmuring of the inhabitants of the most exalted paradise and that he might perceive the sweetness of the call and set foot upon the path one day the tongue of glory uttered word in regard to the ṣáḥib indicating that he may erelong be aided to perform deed that would immortalize his name when his letter was received in his holy and exalted court he said “o servant in attendance although his honour mánikchí hath written only to ask concerning the sayings of others yet from his letter we inhale the sweet savours of affection beseech the one true god to graciously aid him to do his will and pleasure his might in truth is equal to all things from this utterance of the all merciful there wafteth fragrant breath he verily is the all knowing the all informed another inquiry made by him is the following “the laws of islam are based on religious principles and jurisprudence but in the mahábád and hindu religions there are only principles and all laws even those regarding the drinking of water or giving and taking in marriage are considered part of these principles as are all other matters of human life kindly indicate which view is acceptable in the sight of god exalted be his mention religious principles have various degrees and stations the root of all principles and the cornerstone of all foundations hath ever been and shall remain the recognition of god and these days are indeed the vernal season of the recognition of the all merciful whatsoever proceedeth in this day from the repository of his cause and the manifestation of his self is in truth the fundamental principle unto which all must bear allegiance the answer to this question is also embodied in these blessed these weighty and exalted words “be anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye live in and centre your deliberations on its exigencies and requirements” for this day is the lord of all days and whatsoever hath been revealed therein by the source of divine revelation is the truth and the essence of all principles this day may be likened to sea and all other days to gulfs and channels that have branched therefrom that which is uttered and revealed in this day is the foundation and is accounted as the mother book and the source of all utterance although every day is associated with god magnified be his glory yet these days have been singled out and adorned with the ornament of intimate association with him for they have been extolled in the books of the chosen ones of god as well as of some of his prophets as the “day of god” in sense this day and that which appeareth therein are to be regarded as the primary principles while all other days and whatsoever appeareth in them are to be viewed as the secondary ordinances deduced therefrom and which as such are subordinate and relative for instance attending the mosque is secondary with respect to the recognition of god for the former is dependent upon and conditioned by the latter as to the principles current amongst the divines of this age these are merely set of rules which they have devised and from which they infer each according to his own opinions and inclinations the ordinances of god consider for example the question of immediate compliance or postponement god exalted be his glory saith “eat and drink… now it is not known whether this ordinance must be complied with immediately or if its execution may be justifiably postponed some believe that it may be decided by external circumstances once one of the distinguished divines of najaf set out to visit the shrine of imám ḥusayn peace be upon him accompanied by number of his pupils in the course of their journey they were waylaid by group of bedouin the aforementioned divine immediately handed over all his possessions whereupon his pupils exclaimed “your eminence hath always favoured postponement in such matters what prompteth you now to act with such haste pointing to the spears of the bedouin he replied “the force of external circumstances my friends the founder of the principles of islamic jurisprudence was abú ḥanífih who was prominent leader of the sunnis such principles had existed in former times as well as hath already been mentioned in this day however the approval or rejection of all things dependeth wholly upon the word of god these differences are not worthy of mention the eye of divine mercy casteth its glance upon all that is past it behoveth us to mention them only in favourable terms for they do not contradict that which is essential this servant testifieth to his ignorance and beareth witness that all knowledge is with god the help in peril the self subsisting whatsoever runneth counter to the teachings in this day is rejected for the sun of truth is shining resplendent above the horizon of knowledge happy are they who with the waters of divine utterance have cleansed their hearts from all allusions whisperings and suggestions and who have fixed their gaze upon the dayspring of glory this indeed is the most gracious favour and the purest bounty whosoever hath attained thereunto hath attained unto all good for otherwise the knowledge of aught else but god hath never proven nor shall it ever prove profitable unto men that which was mentioned in connection with religious principles and secondary ordinances referreth to the pronouncements which the divines of various religions have made each according to his own capacity at present however it behoveth us to follow his injunction to “leave them to their vain disputes” he verily speaketh the truth and leadeth the way the decree is god’s the almighty the all bounteous another of his questions “some maintain that whatsoever is in accordance with the dictates of nature and of the intellect must needs be both permissible and compulsory in the divine law and conversely that one should refrain from observing that which is incompatible with these standards others believe that whatsoever hath been enjoined by the divine law and its blessed author should be accepted without rational proof or natural evidence and obeyed without question or reservation such as the march between safa and marwah the stoning of the pillar of jamrah the washing of one’s feet during ablutions and so on kindly indicate which of these positions is acceptable intellect hath various degrees as discussion of the pronouncements made by the philosophers in this connection would pass beyond the scope of our discourse we have refrained from mentioning them it is nonetheless indisputably clear and evident that the minds of men have never been nor shall they ever be of equal capacity the perfect intellect alone can provide true guidance and direction thus were these sublime words revealed by the pen of the most high exalted be his glory in response to this question “the tongue of wisdom proclaimeth he that hath me not is bereft of all things turn ye away from all that is on earth and seek none else but me am the sun of wisdom and the ocean of knowledge cheer the faint and revive the dead am the guiding light that illumineth the way am the royal falcon on the arm of the almighty unfold the drooping wings of every broken bird and start it on its flight consider how clearly the answer hath been revealed from the heaven of divine knowledge blessed are those who ponder it who reflect upon it and who apprehend its meaning by the intellect mentioned above is meant the universal divine mind how often hath it been observed that certain human minds far from being source of guidance have become as fetters upon the feet of the wayfarers and prevented them from treading the straight path the lesser intellect being thus circumscribed one must search after him who is the ultimate source of knowledge and strive to recognize him and should one come to acknowledge that source round whom every mind doth revolve then whatsoever he should ordain is the expression of the dictates of consummate wisdom his very being even as the sun is distinct from all else beside him the whole duty of man is to recognize him once this hath been achieved then whatsoever he may please to ordain is binding and in full accordance with the requirements of divine wisdom thus have ordinances and prohibitions of every kind been laid down by the prophets of the past even unto the earliest times certain deeds that are undertaken in this day are intended to emblazon the name of god and the pen of the most high hath fixed recompense for those who perform them indeed should any soul breathe but fleeting breath for the sake of god his recompense will become manifest as attested by this mighty verse which was sent down from the empyrean of the divine will to the lord of mecca blessed and glorified be he “we did not appoint that which thou wouldst have to be the qiblih but that we might know him who followeth the apostle from him who turneth on his heels were anyone to meditate upon this blessed and transcendent revelation and to ponder the verses that have been sent down he would readily bear witness that the one true god is immeasurably exalted above his creatures and that the knowledge of all things hath ever been and shall ever remain with him every fair minded soul moreover will testify that whosoever faileth to embrace the truth of this most great revelation will find himself powerless and incapable of establishing the validity of any other cause or creed and as to those who have deprived themselves of the robe of justice and arisen to promote the cause of iniquity they shall give voice to that which the exponents of hatred and fanaticism have uttered from time immemorial the knowledge of all things is with god the all knowing the all informed one day when this servant was in his presence was asked “o servant in attendance wherewith art thou engaged “i am penning reply” answered “to his honour mírzá abu’l faḍl” was bidden “write to mírzá abu’l faḍl may my glory be upon him and say ‘matters have come to such pass that the people of the world have grown accustomed to iniquity and flee from fair mindedness divine manifestation who hath extolled and magnified the one true god exalted be his glory who hath borne witness to his knowledge and confessed that his essence is sanctified above all things and exalted beyond every comparison—such manifestation hath been called at various times worshipper of the sun or fire worshipper how numerous are those sublime manifestations and revealers of the divine of whose stations the people remain wholly unaware of whose grace they are utterly deprived nay god forbid whom they curse and revile ‘one of the great prophets whom the foolish ones of persia in this day reject uttered these sublime words “the sun is but dense and spherical mass it deserveth not to be called god or the almighty for the almighty lord is he whom no human comprehension can ever conceive whom no earthly knowledge can circumscribe and whose essence none hath ever been or shall ever be able to fathom” consider how eloquently how solemnly he hath affirmed the very truth that god is proclaiming in this day and yet he is not even deemed believer by these abject and foolish ones let alone seen as possessed of sublime station in another connection he said “all existence hath appeared from his existence and were it not for god no creature would have ever existed and been attired with the raiment of being” may the lord shield us all from the wickedness of such as have disputed the truth of god and of his loved ones and turned away from that dayspring whereunto all the books of god the help in peril the self subsisting have testified ’” from that which hath been mentioned it is clear that not every intellect can be the criterion of truth the truly wise are in the first place the chosen ones of god magnified be his glory—they whom he hath singled out to be the treasuries of his knowledge the repositories of his revelation the daysprings of his authority and the dawning places of his wisdom they whom he hath made his representatives on earth and through whom he revealeth that which he hath purposed whoso turneth unto them hath turned unto god and whoso turneth away shall not be remembered in the presence of god the all knowing the all wise the universal criterion is that which hath just been mentioned whosoever attaineth thereunto that is who recognizeth and acknowledgeth the dawning place of god’s revelation will be recorded in the book of god among them that are endued with understanding otherwise he is naught but an ignorant soul though he believe himself to be possessed of every wisdom now were person to see himself standing in the presence of god were he to sanctify his soul from earthly attachments and evil intentions and reflect upon that which hath been revealed in this most great revelation from its inception to this day he would readily testify that every detached soul every perfect mind sanctified being attentive ear penetrating eye eloquent tongue and joyous and radiant heart circleth round and boweth down nay prostrateth itself in submission before the mighty throne of god another of his questions is this “among the manifestations of the past one hath in his time allowed the eating of beef while another hath forbidden it one hath permitted the eating of pork whereas another hath proscribed it thus do their ordinances differ entreat the true one exalted be his name to graciously specify the appropriate religious prohibitions direct reply and detailed explanation of this matter would have overstepped the bounds of wisdom inasmuch as people of diverse faiths associate with the distinguished ṣáḥib and direct reply would have contravened the laws of islam the answer was therefore sent down from the heaven of the divine will in an implicit manner indeed the statement in the first passage where he saith “the all knowing physician hath his finger on the pulse of mankind” was and remaineth the answer to his question he further saith “be anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye live in and centre your deliberations on its exigencies and requirements that is fix your gaze upon the commandments of god for whatsoever he should ordain in this day and pronounce as lawful is indeed lawful and representeth the very truth it is incumbent upon all to turn their gaze towards the cause of god and to observe that which hath dawned above the horizon of his will since it is through the potency of his name that the banner of “he doeth what he willeth” hath been unfurled and the standard of “he ordaineth what he pleaseth” hath been raised aloft for instance were he to pronounce water itself to be unlawful it would indeed become unlawful and the converse holdeth equally true for upon no thing hath it been inscribed “this is lawful” or “this is unlawful” nay rather whatsoever hath been or will be revealed is by virtue of the word of god exalted be his glory these matters are sufficiently clear and require no further elaboration even so certain groups believe that all the ordinances current amongst them are unalterable that they have ever been valid and that they will forever remain so consider further passage glorified and exalted be he “these words are being uttered in due measure that the newly born may thrive and the tender shoot flourish milk must be given in suitable proportion that the children of the world may attain to the station of maturity and abide in the court of oneness for instance some believe that wine hath ever been and shall remain forbidden now were one to inform them that it might one day be made lawful they would arise in protest and opposition in truth the people of the world have yet not grasped the meaning of “he doeth whatsoever he willeth” nor have they comprehended the significance of supreme infallibility the suckling child must be nourished with milk if it be given meat it will assuredly perish and this would be naught but sheer injustice and unwisdom blessed are they that understand supreme infallibility as once heard from his blessed lips is reserved exclusively to the manifestations of the cause of god and the exponents of his revelation this matter is mentioned but briefly for time is short and as scarce as the legendary phoenix yet another question “according to the teachings of the mahábád and hindu religions should person of whatever faith or nation of whatever colour appearance character or condition be disposed to associate with you ye should show forth kindness and treat him as brother but in other religions this is not so their followers ill treat and oppress the adherents of other faiths consider their persecution as an act of worship and regard their kindred and their possessions as lawful unto themselves which approach is acceptable in the sight of god the former statement hath ever been and will continue to be true it is not permissible to contend with anyone nor is it acceptable in the sight of god to ill treat or oppress any soul time and again have these sublime words streamed from the pen of the most high blessed and exalted be he “o ye children of men the fundamental purpose animating the faith of god and his religion is to safeguard the interests and promote the unity of the human race and to foster the spirit of love and fellowship amongst men suffer it not to become source of dissension and discord of hate and enmity” this subject hath already been set forth and explained in various tablets it behoveth him who expoundeth the word of god to deliver it with the utmost good will kindness and compassion as to him that embraceth the truth and is honoured with recognizing him his name shall be recorded in the crimson book among the inmates of the all highest paradise should soul fail however to accept the truth it is in no wise permissible to contend with him in another connection he saith “blessed and happy is he that ariseth to promote the best interests of the peoples and kindreds of the earth likewise he saith “the people of bahá should soar high above the peoples of the world in matters of religion every form of fanaticism hatred dissension and strife is strictly forbidden in this day luminary hath dawned above the horizon of divine providence upon whose brow the pen of glory hath inscribed these exalted words “we have called you into being to show forth love and fidelity not animosity and hatred” likewise on another occasion he—exalted and glorified be his name—hath revealed the following words in the persian tongue words through which the hearts of the well favoured and the sincere amongst his servants are consumed the manifold pursuits of men are harmonized and mankind is illumined by the light of divine unity and enabled to turn towards the dayspring of divine knowledge “the incomparable friend saith the path to freedom hath been outstretched hasten ye thereunto the wellspring of wisdom is overflowing quaff ye therefrom say well beloved ones the tabernacle of unity hath been raised regard ye not one another as strangers ye are the fruits of one tree and the leaves of one branch justice which consisteth in rendering each his due dependeth upon and is conditioned by two words reward and punishment from the standpoint of justice every soul should receive the reward of his actions inasmuch as the peace and prosperity of the world depend thereon even as he saith exalted be his glory “the structure of world stability and order hath been reared upon and will continue to be sustained by the twin pillars of reward and punishment” in brief every circumstance requireth different utterance and every occasion calleth for different course of action blessed are they that have arisen to serve god who speak forth wholly for his sake and who return unto him another of his questions “hindus and zoroastrians do not admit or welcome outsiders who wish to join their ranks christians welcome those who decide of their own accord to embrace their religion but make no effort and exert no pressure to this end muslims and jews however insist upon it enjoin it upon others and should anyone refuse grow hostile and regard it as lawful to seize his kindred and possessions which approach is acceptable in the sight of god the children of men are all brothers and the prerequisites of brotherhood are manifold among them is that one should wish for one’s brother that which one wisheth for oneself therefore it behoveth him who is the recipient of an inward or outward gift or who partaketh of the bread of heaven to inform and invite his friends with the utmost love and kindness if they respond favourably his object is attained otherwise he should leave them to themselves without contending with them or uttering word that would cause the least sadness this is the undoubted truth and aught else is unworthy and unbecoming the distinguished ṣáḥib may god graciously aid him hath written that the hindus and zoroastrians do not permit or welcome outsiders who wish to join their ranks this runneth counter to the purpose underlying the advent of the messengers of god and to that which hath been revealed in their books for those who have appeared at god’s behest have been entrusted with the guidance and education of all people how could they debar seeker from the object of his quest or forbid wayfarer from the desire of his heart the fire temples of the world stand as eloquent testimony to this truth in their time they summoned with burning zeal all the inhabitants of the earth to him who is the spirit of purity he hath moreover written that christians welcome those who decide of their own accord to embrace their religion but make no effort and exert no pressure to this end this however is misconception for the christians have exerted and continue to exert the utmost effort in teaching their faith their church organizations have an expenditure of about thirty million their missionaries have scattered far and wide throughout the globe and are assiduously engaged in teaching christianity thus have they compassed the world how numerous the schools and churches they have founded to instruct children yet their unavowed aim is that these children as they acquire an education may also become acquainted in their early years with the gospel of jesus christ and that the unsullied mirrors of their hearts may thus reflect that which their teachers have purposed indeed the followers of no other religion are as intent upon the propagation of their faith as the christians in brief what is right and true in this day and acceptable before his throne is that which was mentioned at the outset all men have been called into being for the betterment of the world it behoveth every soul to arise and serve his brethren for the sake of god should brother of his embrace the truth he should rejoice that the latter hath attained unto everlasting favour otherwise he should implore god to guide him without manifesting the least trace of animosity or ill feeling towards him the reins of command are in the grasp of god he doeth what he willeth and ordaineth as he pleaseth he verily is the almighty the all praised we beseech the one true god magnified be his glory to enable us to recognize him whose unerring wisdom pervadeth all things and that we may acknowledge his truth for once one hath recognized him and borne witness to his reality one will no longer be troubled by the idle fancies and vain imaginings of men the divine physician hath the pulse of mankind within his almighty grasp at one time he may well deem fit to sever certain infected limbs that the disease may not spread to other parts of the body this would be the very essence of mercy and compassion and to none is given the right to object for he is indeed the all knowing the all seeing another of his questions “in the mahábád and zoroastrian religions it is said ‘our faith and religion is superior to every other the other prophets and the religions they have instituted are true but they occupy different stations before god even as in the court of king there is gradation of ranks from the prime minister to the common soldier whosoever wisheth let him keep the precepts of his religion nor do they impose upon any soul the hindus claim that whosoever partaketh of meat for whatever reason or under whatever circumstances shall never catch glimpse of paradise the followers of muḥammad jesus and moses maintain that similar fate awaiteth those who fail to bear allegiance to their religions which belief is favoured by god glorified be his mention regarding their statement that “our faith and religion is superior to every other” by this is meant such prophets as have appeared before them viewed from one perspective these holy souls are one the first among them is the same as the last and the last is the same as the first all have proceeded from god unto him have they summoned all men and unto him have they returned this theme hath been set forth in the book of certitude which is indeed the cynosure of all books and which streamed from the pen of glory in the early years of this most great revelation blessed is he that hath beheld it and pondered its contents for the love of god the lord of creation concerning the remark attributed to the hindus that whosoever partaketh of meat shall never catch glimpse of paradise this runneth counter to their other assertion that all the prophets are true for if their truth be established then it is absurd to claim that their followers will not ascend unto paradise one fain would ask what they intend by paradise and what they have grasped thereof in this day whosoever attaineth the good pleasure of the one true god magnified be his glory shall be remembered and accounted among the inmates of the all highest heaven and the most exalted paradise and shall partake of its benefits in all the worlds of god by him who is the desire of all men the pen is powerless to portray this station or to expound this theme how great the blessedness of him who hath attained unto the good pleasure of god and woe betide the heedless once the validity of divinely appointed prophet hath been established to none is given the right to ask why or wherefore rather is it incumbent upon all to accept and obey whatsoever he saith this is that which god hath decreed in all his books scriptures and tablets further question that he hath asked “the hindus assert that god fashioned the intellect in the form of man named brahma who came into this world and was the cause of its progress and development and that all hindus are his descendants the followers of zoroaster say ‘god through the agency of the primal intellect created man whose name is mahábád and who is our ancestor they believe the modes of creation to be six in number two were mentioned above the others are creation from water earth fire and from bears and monkeys the hindus and zoroastrians both say that they are begotten of the intellect and thus do not admit others into their folds are these assertions true or not that wise master is requested to indicate that which he deemeth appropriate the entire creation hath been called into being through the will of god magnified be his glory and peerless adam hath been fashioned through the agency of his all compelling word word which is the source the wellspring the repository and the dawning place of the intellect from it all creation hath proceeded and it is the channel of god’s primal grace none can grasp the reality of the origin of creation save god exalted be his glory whose knowledge embraceth all things both before and after they come into being creation hath neither beginning nor end and none hath ever unravelled its mystery its knowledge hath ever been and shall remain hidden and preserved with those who are the repositories of divine knowledge the world of existence is contingent inasmuch as it is preceded by cause while essential preexistence hath ever been and shall remain confined to god magnified be his glory this statement is being made lest one be inclined to conclude from the earlier assertion namely that creation hath no beginning and no end that it is preexistent true and essential preexistence is exclusively reserved to god while the preexistence of the world is secondary and relative all that hath been inferred about firstness lastness and such hath in truth been derived from the sayings of the prophets apostles and chosen ones of god as to the “realm of subtle entities” which is often referred to it pertaineth to the revelation of the prophets and aught else is mere superstition and idle fancy at the time of the revelation all men are equal in rank by reason however of their acceptance or rejection rise or fall motion or stillness recognition or denial they come to differ thereafter for instance the one true god magnified be his glory speaking through the intermediary of his manifestation doth ask “am not your lord every soul that answereth “yea verily is accounted among the most distinguished of all men in the sight of god our meaning is that ere the word of god is delivered all men are deemed equal in rank and their station is one and the same it is only thereafter that differences appear as thou hast no doubt observed it is clearly established from that which hath been mentioned that none may ever justifiably claim “we are begotten of the intellect while all others stem from another origin the truth that shineth bright and resplendent as the sun is this that all have been created through the operation of the divine will and have proceeded from the same source that all are from him and that unto him they shall all return this is the meaning of that blessed verse in the qur’án which hath issued from the pen of the all merciful “verily we are god’s and to him shall we return” as is clear and evident to thee the answer to all of the questions mentioned above was embodied in but one of the passages revealed by the pen of the most high blessed are they who freed from worldly matters and sanctified from idle fancies and vain imaginings traverse the meads of divine knowledge and discern in all things the tokens of his glory numerous passages have been revealed in the name of his honour the ṣáḥib were he to appreciate their value and avail himself of their fruits he would experience such joy that all the sorrows of the world would be powerless to afflict him god grant that he may be enabled to sincerely voice and to act in accordance with the following words “say it is god then leave them to entertain themselves with their cavilings may he endeavour to guide those deprived souls who remain secluded in darkness and obscurity towards the light of the sun may he seize through the potency of the most great name the banner that speaketh of naught save his revelation and march at the forefront of the people of the former religions that perchance the darkness of the world may be dispelled and the effulgent rays of the sun of truth may shine upon all mankind this in truth is the most perfect bounty and the highest calling should man fail to attain unto this sublime station where then can he find comfort and joy what will sustain and animate him with whom will he commune at the hour of repose and whose name will he invoke when he riseth from slumber again “verily we are god’s and to him shall we return his last question “most of the tablets that we have seen are in arabic however since the beloved in this age is of persian descent the arabic tongue should be abandoned and discarded for to this day the arabs themselves have not understood the meaning of the qur’án whereas the persian language is highly prized lauded and admired among the dwellers of the inhabited quarter of the globe and just as the persian of the present day is superior to arabic so too is old persian which is greatly favoured by the people of india and others it would therefore be preferable if the words of god magnified be his mention were hereafter mainly delivered in pure persian since it attracteth the hearts to greater degree it is moreover requested that the reply to these questions be graciously written in pure persian the persian tongue is in truth exceedingly sweet and pleasing and ever since this request was submitted in his most blessed and exalted court numerous tablets have been revealed in that language as to the statement concerning the qur’án implying that its outward meaning hath not been understood in reality it hath been interpreted in numerous ways and translated into countless languages that which men have been unable to grasp are its hidden mysteries and inner meanings and all that they have said or will say is limited in scope and should be seen as commensurate with their rank and station for none can fathom its true meaning save god the one the incomparable the all knowing in this day he who is the lord the ruler the fashioner and the refuge of the world hath appeared let every ear be eager to hearken unto that which will be revealed from the kingdom of his will let every eye be expectant to gaze upon that which will shine forth from the daystar of knowledge and wisdom by him who is the desire of the world this is the day for eyes to see and for ears to hear for hearts to perceive and for tongues to speak forth blessed are they that have attained thereunto blessed are they that have sought after and recognized it this is the day whereon every man may accede unto everlasting honour for whatsoever hath streamed forth from the pen of glory in regard to any soul is adorned with the ornament of immortality again blessed are they that have attained thereunto the distinguished ṣáḥib hath written “since the beloved in this age is of persian descent the arabic tongue should be abandoned and discarded in this connection these sublime words issued from the pen of the most high magnified and exalted be his glory “both arabic and persian are laudable that which is desired of language is that it convey the intent of the speaker and either language can serve this purpose and since in this day the orb of knowledge hath risen in the firmament of persia this tongue deserveth every praise the light of truth is indeed shining resplendent above the horizon of divine utterance and hence no further elaboration is required from this evanescent soul or from others like unto him although there can be no question or doubt as to the sweetness of the persian tongue yet it hath not the scope of the arabic there are many things which have not been expressed in persian that is to say words referring to such things have not been devised whilst in arabic there are several words describing the same thing indeed there existeth no language in the world as vast and comprehensive as arabic this statement is prompted by truth and fairness otherwise it is clear that in this day the world is being illumined by the splendours of that sun which hath dawned above the horizon of persia and that the merits of this sweet language can scarcely be overestimated all the questions of his honour the ṣáḥib have herewith been mentioned and duly answered if it be deemed appropriate and advisable there would be no harm in his perusing these answers himself and likewise they may be read by the beloved friends in that land such as jináb ‘alí akbar upon him be the glory of god the supreme ordainer and jináb áqá mírzá asadu’lláh upon him be the glory of glories this servant beseecheth the one true god—exalted be his glory—to graciously adorn the world of humanity with justice and fair mindedness although in truth the latter is but one of the expressions of the former verily justice is lamp that guideth man aright amidst the darkness of the world and shieldeth him from every danger it is indeed shining lamp god grant that the rulers of the earth may be illumined by its light this servant further imploreth god to graciously aid all men to do his will and pleasure he in truth is the lord of this world and of the world to come no god is there but him the almighty the most powerful in the name of the lord of utterance the all wise allpraise be to the sanctified lord who hath illumined the world through the splendours of the daystar of his grace from the letter “b” he hath made the most great ocean to appear and from the letter “h” he hath caused his inmost essence to be made manifest he is that almighty one whose purpose the might of men can never hope to frustrate and the flow of whose utterance the hosts of kings are powerless to halt thy letter was received and we perused it and heard thy call within it were enshrined the precious pearls of love and the hidden mysteries of affection we beseech the peerless lord to enable thee to assist his cause and to lead those who are sore athirst in the wilderness of ignorance to the water of life his might in truth is equal to all things that which thou didst ask of the ocean of knowledge and the orb of insight hath met with his acceptance the first question “in what tongue and towards what direction doth it behove us to worship the one true god the beginning of all utterance is the worship of god and this followeth upon his recognition sanctified must be the eye if it is to truly recognize him and sanctified must be the tongue if it is to befittingly utter his praise in this day the faces of the people of insight and understanding are turned in his direction nay every direction inclineth itself towards him lion hearted one we beseech god that thou mayest become champion in this arena arise with heavenly power and say “o high priests ears have been given you that they may hearken unto the mystery of him who is the self dependent and eyes that they may behold him wherefore flee ye the incomparable friend is manifest he speaketh that wherein lieth salvation were ye high priests to discover the perfume of the rose garden of understanding ye would seek none other but him and would recognize in his new vesture the all wise and peerless one and would turn your eyes from the world and all who seek it and would arise to help him the second question concerneth faith and religion the faith of god hath in this day been made manifest he who is the lord of the world is come and hath shown the way his faith is the faith of benevolence and his religion is the religion of forbearance this faith bestoweth eternal life and this religion enableth mankind to dispense with all else it verily embraceth all faiths and all religions take hold thereof and guard it well the third question “in what manner shall we deal with the people of this age who have each chosen to follow different religion and who each regard their own faith and religion as excelling and surpassing all the others that we may be shielded from the onslaught of their words and deeds lion hearted one amongst men regard the afflictions endured in the path of god as comfort itself every affliction suffered for his sake is potent remedy every bitterness is naught but sweetness and every abasement an exaltation were men to apprehend and acknowledge this truth they would readily lay down their lives for such affliction for it is the key to inestimable treasures and no matter how outwardly abhorrent it hath ever been and will continue to be inwardly prized we accept and affirm what thou hast said for the people of the world are indeed bereft of the light of the orb of justice and regard it as their enemy if thou desirest to be freed from affliction recite thou this prayer which hath been revealed by the pen of the all merciful “o god my god testify to thy unity and to thy oneness beseech thee thou possessor of names and fashioner of the heavens by the pervasive influence of thine exalted word and the potency of thy supreme pen to aid me with the ensigns of thy power and might and to protect me from the mischief of thine enemies who have violated thy covenant and thy testament thou art verily the almighty the most powerful this invocation is an impregnable stronghold and an indomitable army it conferreth protection and ensureth deliverance the fourth question “our books have announced thatsháh bahrám will come invested with manifold signs to guide the people aright… friend whatsoever hath been announced in the books hath been revealed and made clear from every direction the signs have been manifested the omnipotent one is calling in this day and announcing the appearance of the supreme heaven the world hath been illumined with the splendours of his revelation yet how few are the eyes that can behold it beseech the peerless and incomparable lord to bestow penetrating insight upon his servants for insight leadeth to true knowledge and is conducive to salvation indeed the attainments of man’s understanding are dependent upon his keenness of sight were the children of men to gaze with the eye of understanding they would see the world illumined with new light in this day say the daystar of knowledge is manifest and the luminary of insight hath appeared fortunate indeed is the one who hath attained who hath witnessed and who hath recognized the fifth question concerneth the bridge of ṣiráṭ paradise and hell the prophets of god have come in truth and have spoken the truth whatsoever the messenger of god hath announced hath been and will be made manifest the world is established upon the foundations of reward and punishment knowledge and understanding have ever affirmed and will continue to affirm the reality of paradise and hell for reward and punishment require their existence paradise signifieth first and foremost the good pleasure of god whosoever attaineth his good pleasure is reckoned and recorded among the inhabitants of the most exalted paradise and will attain after the ascension of his soul that which pen and ink are powerless to describe for them that are endued with insight and have fixed their gaze upon the most sublime vision the bridge the balance paradise hellfire and all that hath been mentioned and recorded in the sacred scriptures are clear and manifest at the time of the appearance and manifestation of the rays of the daystar of truth all occupy the same station god then proclaimeth that which he willeth and whoso heareth his call and acknowledgeth his truth is accounted among the inhabitants of paradise such soul hath traversed the bridge the balance and all that hath been recorded regarding the day of resurrection and hath reached his destination the day of god’s revelation is the day of the most great resurrection we cherish the hope that quaffing from the choice wine of divine inspiration and the pure waters of heavenly grace thou mayest attain the station of discovery and witnessing and behold both outwardly and inwardly all that which thou hast mentioned the sixth question “after relinquishing the body that is to say after the soul hath been separated from the body it hasteneth to the abode hereafter …” in reference to this theme there appeared some time past from the pen of divine knowledge that which sufficeth the men of insight and imparteth the greatest joy to the people of understanding verily we say the soul is gladdened by goodly deeds and profiteth from the contributions made in the path of god the seventh question regardeth the name lineage and ancestry of the holy one abu’l faḍl gulpáygání upon him be my glory hath written in this regard based on the sacred scriptures that which bestoweth knowledge and increaseth understanding the faith of god is endowed with penetrating might and power erelong that which hath flowed from our tongue will outwardly come to pass we beseech god to bestow upon thee the strength to assist him he verily is the all knowing the all powerful wert thou to obtain and peruse the súriy ra’ís and the súriy mulúk thou wouldst find thyself able to dispense with thy questions and wouldst arise to serve the cause of god in such wise that the oppression of the world and the onslaught of its peoples would fail to deter thee from aiding him who is the ancient and sovereign lord of all we implore god to confirm thee in that which will exalt and immortalize thy name make thou an effort that haply thou mayest obtain the aforementioned tablets and acquire therefrom share of the pearls of wisdom and utterance that have issued from the treasury of the pen of the all merciful the glory of god rest upon thee upon every steadfast and unwavering heart and upon every constant and faithful soul the beginning of all utterance is the praise of god servants the springs of divine bestowal are streaming forth quaff ye therefrom that by the aid of the incomparable friend ye may be sanctified from this darksome world of dust and enter his abode renounce the world and direct your steps toward the city of the beloved servants the fire that consumeth all veils hath been kindled by my hand quench it not with the waters of ignorance the heavens are the token of my greatness look upon them with pure eye the stars bear witness to my truth bear ye likewise witness thereto servants eyes are needed if one is to see and ears if one is to hear whoso in this blessed day hath not heard the divine call hath indeed no ear by this is not meant that bodily ear that is perceived by the eye open your inner eye that ye may behold the celestial fire and listen with the ear of inner understanding that ye may hear the delightsome words of the beloved servants if your heart acheth for the beloved lo the remedy is come if ye have eyes to see behold the shining countenance of the friend hath appeared kindle ye the fire of knowledge and flee from the ignorant such are the words of the lord of the world servants lifeless is the body that is bereft of soul and withered the heart that is devoid of the remembrance of its lord commune with the remembrance of the friend and shun the enemy your enemy is such things as ye have acquired of your own inclination to which ye have firmly clung and whereby ye have sullied your souls the soul hath been created for the remembrance of the friend safeguard its purity the tongue hath been created to bear witness to god pollute it not with the mention of the wayward servants verily say he is to be accounted as truthful who hath beheld the straight path that path is one and god hath chosen and prepared it it shineth as resplendent amongst all paths as the sun amongst the stars whosoever hath not attained it hath failed to apprehend the truth and hath gone astray such are the counsels of the incomparable the peerless lord servants this nether world is the abode of demons guard yourselves from approaching them by demons is meant those wayward souls who with the burden of their evil deeds slumber in the chambers of oblivion their sleep is preferable to their wakefulness and their death is better than their life servants not every mortal frame hath spirit or is imbued with life in this day he is endowed with spirit who with all his heart seeketh the abode of the beloved the end of all beginnings is to be found in this day turn ye not blind eye unto it the matchless friend is nigh stray not far from him servants ye are even as saplings in garden which are near to perishing for want of water wherefore revive your souls with the heavenly water that is raining down from the clouds of divine bounty words must be followed by deeds whoso accepteth the words of the friend is in truth man of deeds otherwise dead carcass is verily of greater worth servants pleasant is the utterance of the friend where is the soul who will taste its sweetness and where is the ear that will hearken unto it well is it with him who in this day communeth with the friend and in his path renounceth and forsaketh all save him that he may behold new world and gain admittance to the everlasting paradise the lord of the world saith servants forsake your own desires and seek that which have desired for you walk ye not without one to guide you on the way and accept ye not the words of every guide how numerous the guides who have gone astray and failed to discover the straight path he alone is guide who is free from the bondage of this world and whom nothing whatsoever can deter from speaking the truth servants follow the path of truthfulness and turn not away from the needy make mention of me before the great ones of the earth and fear not servants be pure in your deeds and conduct yourselves in accordance with the words of god such are the counsels of the incomparable lord the beginning of every account is the name of god friendsof god incline your inner ears to the voice of the peerless and self subsisting lord that he may deliver you from the bonds of entanglement and the depths of darkness and enable you to attain the eternal light ascent and descent stillness and motion have come into being through the will of the lord of all that hath been and shall be the cause of ascent is lightness and the cause of lightness is heat thus hath it been decreed by god the cause of stillness is weight and density which in turn are caused by cold thus hath it been decreed by god and since he hath ordained heat to be the source of motion and ascent and the cause of attainment to the desired goal he hath therefore kindled with the mystic hand that fire that dieth not and sent it forth into the world that this divine fire might by the heat of the love of god guide and attract all mankind to the abode of the incomparable friend this is the mystery enshrined in your book that was sent down aforetime mystery which hath until now remained concealed from the eyes and hearts of men that primal fire hath in this day appeared with new radiance and with immeasurable heat this divine fire burneth of itself with neither fuel nor fume that it might draw away such excess moisture and cold as are the cause of torpor and weariness of lethargy and despondency and lead the entire creation to the court of the presence of the all merciful whoso hath approached this fire hath been set aflame and attained the desired goal and whoso hath removed himself therefrom hath remained deprived servant of god turn thou away from the stranger that thou mayest recognize the friend he indeed is stranger who leadeth you away from the friend this is not the day whereon the high priests can command and exercise their authority in your book it is stated that the high priests will on that day lead men far astray and will prevent them from drawing nigh unto him he indeed is high priest who hath seen the light and hastened unto the way leading to the beloved such man is benevolent priest and source of illumination to the whole world servant of god any priest who leadeth thee away from this fire which is the reality of the light and the mystery of divine revelation is indeed thine enemy suffer not the words of the foe to hold thee back from the friend or the insinuations of the enemy to cause thee to forsake the beloved servant of god the day of deeds hath come now is not the time for words the messenger of god hath appeared now is not the hour for hesitation open thou thine inner eye that thou mayest behold the face of the beloved and hearken thou with thine inner ear that thou mayest hear the sweet murmur of his celestial voice servant of god the robe of divine bestowal hath been sewn and readied take hold of it and attire thyself therewith renounce and forsake the people of the world wise one shouldst thou heed the counsel of thy lord thou wouldst be released from the bondage of his servants and behold thyself

men might hearken with their inner ear soar upon the wings of joy in the atmosphere of the love of god regard the people of the world as dead and seek the fellowship of the living whoso hath not breathed the sweet fragrance of the beloved at this dawntide is indeed accounted among the dead he who is the all sufficing proclaimeth aloud “the realm of joy hath been ushered in be not sorrowful the hidden mystery hath been made manifest be not disheartened wert thou to apprehend the surpassing greatness of this day thou wouldst renounce the world and all that dwell therein and hasten unto the way that leadeth to the lord servants of god deprived souls are heedless of this triumphant day and chilled hearts have no share of the heat of this blazing fire servant of god the tree which we had planted with the hand of providence hath borne its destined fruit and the glad tidings we had imparted in the book have appeared in full effect servant of god we revealed ourself to thee once in thy sleep but thou didst remain unaware remember now that thou mayest perceive and hasten with heart and soul to the placeless friend servant of god say high priests the hand of omnipotence is stretched forth from behind the clouds behold ye it with new eyes the tokens of his majesty and greatness are unveiled gaze ye on them with pure eyes servant of god the daystar of the everlasting realm is shining resplendent above the horizon of his will and the oceans of divine bounty are surging bereft indeed is the one who hath failed to behold them and lifeless the one who hath not attained thereunto close thine eyes to this nether world open them to the countenance of the incomparable friend and commune intimately with his spirit servant of god with pure heart unloose thy

most exalted angels oh how long to announce unto every spot on the surface of the earth and to carry to each one of its cities the glad tidings of this revelation—a revelation to which the heart of sinai hath been attracted and in whose name the burning bush is calling ‘unto god the lord of lords belong the kingdoms of earth and heaven verily this is the day in which both land and sea rejoice at this announcement the day for which have been laid up those things which god through bounty beyond the ken of mortal mind or heart hath destined for revelation ere long will god sail his ark upon thee

from our presence unto him whom the veils of names have failed to keep back from god the creator of earth and heaven that his eyes may be cheered in the days of his lord the help in peril the self subsisting say followers of the son have ye shut out yourselves from me by reason of my name wherefore ponder ye not in your hearts day and night ye have been calling upon your lord the omnipotent but when he came from the heaven of eternity in his great glory ye turned aside from him and remained sunk in heedlessness consider those who rejected the spirit when he came unto them with manifest dominion how numerous the pharisees who had secluded themselves in synagogues in his name lamenting over their separation from him and yet when the portals of reunion were flung open and the divine luminary shone resplendent from the dayspring of beauty they disbelieved in god the exalted the mighty they failed to attain his presence notwithstanding that his advent had been promised them in the book of isaiah as well as in the books of the prophets and the messengers no one from among them turned his face towards the dayspring of divine bounty except such as were destitute of any power amongst men and yet today every man endowed with power and invested with sovereignty prideth himself on his name moreover call thou to mind the one who sentenced jesus to death he was the most learned of his age in his own country whilst he who was only fisherman believed in him take good heed and be of them that observe the warning consider likewise how numerous at this time are the monks who have secluded themselves in their churches calling upon the spirit but when he appeared through the power of truth they failed to draw nigh unto him and are numbered with those that have gone far astray happy are they that have abandoned them and set their faces towards him who is the desire of all that are in the heavens and all that are on the earth they read the evangel and yet refuse to acknowledge the all glorious lord notwithstanding that he hath come through the potency of his exalted his mighty and gracious dominion we verily have come for your sakes and have borne the misfortunes of the world for your salvation flee ye the one who hath sacrificed his life that ye may be quickened fear god followers of the spirit and walk not in the footsteps of every divine that hath gone far astray do ye imagine that he seeketh his own interests when he hath at all times been threatened by the swords of the enemies or that he seeketh the vanities of the world after he hath been imprisoned in the most desolate of cities be fair in your judgment and follow not the footsteps of the unjust open the doors of your hearts he who is the spirit verily standeth before them wherefore keep ye afar from him who hath purposed to draw you nigh unto resplendent spot say we in truth have opened unto you the gates of the kingdom will ye bar the doors of your houses in my face this indeed is naught but grievous error he verily hath again come down from heaven even as he came down from it the first time beware lest ye dispute that which he proclaimeth even as the people before you disputed his utterances thus instructeth you the true one could ye but perceive it the river jordan is joined to the most great ocean and the son in the holy vale crieth out “here am here am lord my god whilst sinai circleth round the house and the burning bush calleth aloud “he who is the desired one is come in his transcendent majesty say lo the father is come and that which ye were promised in the kingdom is fulfilled this is the word which the son concealed when to those around him he said “ye cannot bear it now and when the appointed time was fulfilled and the hour had struck the word shone forth above the horizon of the will of god beware followers of the son that ye cast it not behind your backs take ye fast hold of it better is this for you than all that ye possess verily he is nigh unto them that do good the hour which we had concealed from the knowledge of the peoples of the earth and of the favored angels hath come to pass say verily he hath testified of me and do testify of him indeed he hath purposed no one other than me unto this beareth witness every fair minded and understanding soul though beset with countless afflictions we summon the people unto

and yet ye are disporting yourselves in the vale of heedlessness he in truth liveth in the most desolate of abodes for your sakes whilst ye dwell in your palaces say did ye not hearken to the voice of the crier calling aloud in the wilderness of the bayán bearing unto you the glad tidings of the coming of your lord the all merciful lo he is come in the sheltering shadow of testimony invested with conclusive proof and evidence and those who truly believe in him regard his presence as the embodiment of the kingdom of god blessed is the man who turneth towards him and woe betide such as deny or doubt him announce thou unto the priests lo he who is the ruler is come step out from behind the veil in the name of thy lord he who layeth low the necks of all men proclaim then unto all mankind the

my bounty and my glory this is the call of the all glorious which is proclaimed from the supreme horizon in the prison of ‘akká he is the expounder the all knowing the all informed god the true one testifieth and the revealers of his names and attributes bear witness that our sole purpose in raising the call and in proclaiming his sublime word is that the ear of the entire creation may through the living waters of divine utterance be purged from lying tales and become attuned to the holy the glorious and exalted word which hath issued forth from the repository of the knowledge of the maker of the heavens and the creator of names happy are they that judge with fairness people of the earth the first glad tidingswhich the mother book hath in this most great revelation imparted unto all the peoples of the world is that the law of holy war hath been blotted out from the book glorified be the all merciful the lord of grace abounding through whom the door of heavenly bounty hath been flung open in the face of all that are in heaven and on earth the second glad tidings it is permitted that the peoples and kindreds of the world associate with one another with joy and radiance people consort with the followers of all religions in spirit of friendliness and fellowship thus hath the daystar of his sanction and authority shone forth above the horizon of the decree of god the lord of the worlds the third glad tidingsconcerneth the study of divers languages this decree hath formerly streamed forth from the pen of the most high it behooveth the sovereigns of the world—may god assist them—or the ministers of the earth to take counsel together and to adopt one of the existing languages or new one to be taught to children in schools throughout the world and likewise one script thus the whole earth will come to be regarded as one country well is it with him who hearkeneth unto his call and observeth that whereunto he is bidden by god the lord of the mighty throne the fourth glad

truthfulness this is that which hath been revealed at the behest of him who is the ordainer the ancient of days it is binding and incumbent upon the peoples of the world one and all to extend aid unto this momentous cause which is come from the heaven of the will of the ever abiding god that perchance the fire of animosity which blazeth in the hearts of some of the peoples of the earth may through the living waters of divine wisdom and by virtue of heavenly counsels and exhortations be quenched and the light of unity and concord may shine forth and shed its radiance upon the world we cherish the hope that through the earnest endeavours of such as are the exponents of the power of god—exalted be his glory—the weapons of war throughout the world may be converted into instruments of reconstruction and that strife and conflict may be removed from the midst of men the sixth glad tidingsis the establishment of the lesser peace details of which have formerly been revealed from our

the seen and the unseen the lord of the exalted throne the ninth glad tidings when the sinner findeth himself wholly detached and freed from all save god he should beg forgiveness and pardon from him confession of sins and transgressions before human beings is not permissible as it hath never been nor will ever be conducive to divine forgiveness moreover such confession before people results in one’s humiliation and abasement and god—exalted be his glory—wisheth not the humiliation of his servants verily he is the compassionate the merciful the sinner should between himself and god implore mercy from the ocean of mercy beg forgiveness from the heaven of generosity and say god my god implore thee by the blood of thy true lovers who were so enraptured by thy sweet utterance that they hastened unto the pinnacle of glory the site of the most glorious martyrdom and beseech thee by the mysteries which lie enshrined in thy knowledge and by the pearls that are treasured in the ocean of

dwell in thy heaven and on thine earth alas alas my sins have prevented me from approaching the court of thy holiness and my trespasses have caused me to stray far from the tabernacle of thy majesty have committed that which thou didst forbid me to do and have put away what thou didst order me to observe pray thee by him who is the sovereign lord of names to write down for me with the pen of thy

horizon the daystar of wisdom and utterance shineth resplendent the most despised of men in the sight of god are those who sit idly and beg hold ye fast unto the cord of material means placing your whole trust in god the provider of all means when anyone occupieth himself in craft or trade such occupation itself is regarded in the estimation of god as an act of worship and this is naught but token of his infinite and all pervasive bounty the thirteenth glad tidings the men of god’s house of justice have been charged with the affairs of the people they in truth are the trustees of god among his servants and the daysprings of authority in his countries people of god that which traineth the world is justice for it is upheld by two pillars reward and punishment these two pillars are the sources of life to the world inasmuch as for each day there is new problem and for every problem an expedient solution such affairs should be referred to the ministers of the house of justice that they may act according to the needs and requirements of the time they that for the sake of god arise to serve his cause are the recipients of divine inspiration from the unseen kingdom it is incumbent upon all to be obedient unto them all matters of state should be referred to the house of justice but acts of worship must be observed according to that which god hath revealed in his book people of bahá ye are the dawning places of the love of god and the daysprings of his loving kindness defile not your tongues with the cursing and reviling of any soul and guard your eyes against that which is not seemly set forth that which ye possess if it be favorably received your end is attained if not to protest is vain leave that soul to himself and turn unto the lord the protector the self subsisting be not the cause of grief much less of discord and strife the hope is cherished that ye may obtain true education in the shelter of the tree of his tender mercies and act in accordance with that which god desireth ye are all the leaves of one tree and the drops of one ocean the fourteenth glad tidings it is not necessary to undertake special journeys to visit the resting places of the dead if people of substance and affluence offer the cost of such journeys to the house of justice it will be pleasing and acceptable in the presence of god happy are they that observe his precepts the fifteenth glad tidings although republican form of government profiteth all the peoples of the world yet the majesty of kingship is one of the signs of god we do not wish that the countries of the world should remain deprived thereof if the sagacious combine the two forms into one great will be their reward in the presence of god in former religions such ordinances as holy war destruction of books the ban on association and companionship with other peoples or on reading certain books had been laid down and affirmed according to the exigencies of the time however in this mighty revelation in this momentous announcement the manifold bestowals and favors of god have overshadowed all men and from the horizon of the will of the ever abiding lord his infallible decree hath prescribed that which we have set forth above we yield praise unto god—hallowed and glorified be he—for whatsoever he hath graciously revealed in this blessed this glorious and incomparable day indeed if everyone on earth were endowed with myriad tongues and were to continually praise god and magnify his name to the end that knoweth no end their thanksgiving would not prove adequate for even one of the gracious favors we have mentioned in this tablet unto this beareth witness every man of wisdom and discernment of understanding and knowledge we earnestly beseech god—exalted be his glory—to aid the rulers and sovereigns who are the exponents of power and the daysprings of glory to enforce his laws and ordinances he is in truth the omnipotent the all powerful he who is wont to answer the call of men in my name which standeth supreme above all names praiseand glory beseem the lord of names and the creator of the heavens he the waves of whose ocean of revelation surge before the eyes of the peoples of the world the daystar of his cause shineth through every veil and his word of affirmation standeth beyond the reach of negation neither the ascendancy of the oppressor nor the tyranny of the wicked hath been able to thwart his purpose how glorified is his sovereignty how exalted his dominion great god although his signs have encompassed the world and his proofs and testimonies are shining forth and manifest as the light yet the ignorant appear heedless nay rather rebellious would that they had been content with opposition but at all times they are plotting to cut down the sacred lote tree since the dawn of this revelation the embodiments of selfishness have by resorting to cruelty and oppression striven to extinguish the light of divine manifestation but god having stayed their hands revealed this light through his sovereign authority and protected it through the power of his might until earth and heaven were illumined by its radiance and brightness praise be unto him under all conditions glory be unto thee lord of the world and desire of the nations thou who hast become manifest in the greatest name whereby the pearls of wisdom and utterance have appeared from the shells of the great sea of thy knowledge and the heavens of divine revelation have been adorned with the light of the appearance of the sun of thy countenance beg of thee by that word through which thy proof was perfected among thy creatures and thy testimony was fulfilled among thy servants to strengthen thy people in that whereby the face of the cause will radiate in thy dominion the standards of thy power will be planted among thy servants and the banners of thy guidance will be raised throughout thy dominions my lord thou beholdest them clinging to the rope of thy grace and holding fast unto the hem of the mantle of thy beneficence ordain for them that which may draw them nearer unto thee and withhold them from all else save thee beg of thee thou king of existence and protector of the seen and the unseen to make whosoever ariseth to serve thy cause as sea moving by thy desire as one ablaze with the fire of thy sacred tree shining from the horizon of the heaven of thy will verily thou art the mighty one whom neither the power of all the world nor the strength of nations can weaken there is no god but thee the one the incomparable the protector the self subsistent thou who hast quaffed the wine of mine utterance from the chalice of my knowledge these sublime words were heard today from the rustling of the divine lote tree which the lord of names hath with the hand of celestial power planted in the all highest paradise the first ṭarázand the first effulgence which hath dawned from the horizon of the mother book is that man should know his own self and recognize that which leadeth unto loftiness or lowliness glory or abasement wealth or poverty having attained the stage of fulfillment and reached his maturity man standeth in need of wealth and such wealth as he acquireth through crafts or professions is commendable and praiseworthy in the estimation of men of wisdom and especially in the eyes of servants who dedicate themselves to the education of the world and to the edification of its peoples they are in truth cup bearers of the life giving water of knowledge and guides unto the ideal way they direct the peoples of the world to the straight path and acquaint them with that which is conducive to human upliftment and exaltation the straight path is the one which guideth man to the dayspring of perception and to the dawning place of true understanding and leadeth him to that which will redound to glory honor and greatness we cherish the hope that through the loving kindness of the all wise the all knowing obscuring dust may be dispelled and the power of perception enhanced that the people may discover the purpose for which they have been called into being in this day whatsoever serveth to reduce blindness and to increase vision is worthy of consideration this vision acteth as the agent and guide for true knowledge indeed in the estimation of men of wisdom keenness of understanding is due to keenness of vision the people of bahá must under all circumstances observe that which is meet and seemly and exhort the people accordingly the second ṭarázis to consort with the followers of all religions in spirit of friendliness and fellowship to proclaim that which the speaker on sinai hath set forth and to observe fairness in all matters they that are endued with sincerity and faithfulness should associate with all the peoples and kindreds of the earth with joy and radiance inasmuch as consorting with people hath promoted and will continue to promote unity and concord which in turn are conducive to the maintenance of order in the world and to the regeneration of nations blessed are such as hold fast to the cord of kindliness and tender mercy and are free from animosity and hatred this wronged one exhorteth the peoples of the world to observe tolerance and righteousness which are two lights amidst the darkness of the world and two educators for the edification of mankind happy are they who have attained thereto and woe betide the heedless the third ṭarázconcerneth good character good character is verily the best mantle for men from god with it he adorneth the temples of his loved ones by my life the light of good character surpasseth the light of the sun and the radiance thereof whoso attaineth unto it is accounted as jewel among men the glory and the upliftment of the world must needs depend upon it goodly character is means whereby men are guided to the straight path and are led to the great announcement well is it with him who is adorned with the saintly attributes and character of the concourse on high it beseemeth you to fix your gaze under all conditions upon justice and fairness in the hidden words this exalted utterance hath been revealed from our most august pen “o son of spirit the best beloved of all things in my sight is justice turn not away therefrom if thou desirest me and neglect it not that may confide in thee by its aid thou shalt see with thine own eyes and not through the eyes of others and shalt know of thine own knowledge and not through the knowledge of thy neighbor ponder this in thy heart how it behooveth thee to be verily justice is my gift to thee and the sign of my loving kindness set it then before thine eyes they that are just and fair minded in their judgment occupy sublime station and hold an exalted rank the light of piety and uprightness shineth resplendent from these souls we earnestly hope that the peoples and countries of the world may not be deprived of the splendors of these two luminaries the fourth ṭarázconcerneth trustworthiness verily it is the door of security for all that dwell on earth and token of glory on the part of the all merciful he who partaketh thereof hath indeed partaken of the treasures of wealth and prosperity trustworthiness is the greatest portal leading unto the tranquility and security of the people in truth the stability of every affair hath depended and doth depend upon it all the domains of power of grandeur and of wealth are illumined by its light not long ago these sublime words were revealed from the pen of the most high “we will now mention unto thee trustworthiness and the station thereof in the estimation of god thy lord the lord of the mighty throne one day of days we repaired unto our green island upon our arrival we beheld its streams flowing and its trees luxuriant and the sunlight playing in their midst turning our face to the right we beheld what the pen is powerless to describe nor can it set forth that which the eye of the lord of mankind witnessed in that most sanctified that most sublime that blest and most exalted spot turning then to the left we gazed on one of the beauties of the most sublime paradise standing on pillar of light and calling aloud saying ‘o inmates of earth and heaven behold ye my beauty and my radiance and my revelation and my effulgence by god the true one am trustworthiness and the revelation thereof and the beauty thereof will recompense whosoever will cleave unto me and recognize my rank and station and hold fast unto my hem am the most great ornament of the people of bahá and the vesture of glory unto all who are in the kingdom of creation am the supreme instrument for the prosperity of the world and the horizon of assurance unto all beings thus have we sent down for thee that which will draw men nigh unto the lord of creation people of bahá trustworthiness is in truth the best of vestures for your temples and the most glorious crown for your heads take ye fast hold of it at the behest of him who is the ordainer the all informed the fifth ṭarázconcerneth the protection and preservation of the stations of god’s servants one should not ignore the truth of any matter rather should one give expression to that which is right and true the people of bahá should not deny any soul the reward due to him should treat craftsmen with deference and unlike the people aforetime should not defile their tongues with abuse in this day the sun of craftsmanship shineth above the horizon of the occident and the river of arts is flowing out of the sea of that region one must speak with fairness and appreciate such bounty by the life of god the word “equity” shineth bright and resplendent even as the sun we pray god to graciously shed its radiance upon everyone he is in truth powerful over all things he who is wont to answer the prayers of all men in these days truthfulness and sincerity are sorely afflicted in the clutches of falsehood and justice is tormented by the scourge of injustice the smoke of corruption hath enveloped the whole world in such wise that naught can be seen in any direction save regiments of soldiers and nothing is heard from any land but the clashing of swords we beseech god the true one to strengthen the wielders of his power in that which will rehabilitate the world and bring tranquility to the nations the sixth ṭaráz knowledge is one of the wondrous gifts of god it is incumbent upon everyone to acquire it such arts and material means as are now manifest have been achieved by virtue of his knowledge and wisdom which have been revealed in epistles and tablets through his most exalted pen—a pen out of whose treasury pearls of wisdom and utterance and the arts and crafts of the world are brought to light in this day the secrets of the earth are laid bare before the eyes of men the pages of swiftly appearing newspapers are indeed the mirror of the world they reflect the deeds and the pursuits of divers peoples and kindreds they both reflect them and make them known they are mirror endowed with hearing sight and speech this is an amazing and potent phenomenon however it behooveth the writers thereof to be purged from the promptings of evil passions and desires and to be attired with the raiment of justice and equity they should inquire into situations as much as possible and ascertain the facts then set them down in writing concerning this wronged one most of the things reported in the newspapers are devoid of truth fair speech and truthfulness by reason of their lofty rank and position are regarded as sun shining above the horizon of knowledge the waves rising from this ocean are apparent before the eyes of the peoples of the world and the effusions of the pen of wisdom and utterance are manifest everywhere it is reported in the press that this servant hath fled from the land of ṭá ṭihrán and gone to ‘iráq gracious god not even for single moment hath this wronged one ever concealed himself rather hath he at all times remained steadfast and conspicuous before the eyes of all men never have we retreated nor shall we ever seek flight in truth it is the foolish people who flee from our presence we left our home country accompanied by two mounted escorts representing the two honored governments of persia and russia until we arrived in ‘iráq in the plenitude of glory and power praise be to god the cause whereof this wronged one is the bearer standeth as high as heaven and shineth resplendent as the sun concealment hath no access unto this station nor is there any occasion for fear or silence the mysteries of resurrection and the events of the last hour are openly manifest but the people are sunk in heedlessness and have suffered themselves to be wrapt in veils “and when the seas shall boil… and when the scriptures shall be unrolled by the righteousness of god the dawn hath truly brightened and the light hath shone forth and the night hath receded happy are they that comprehend happy are they that have attained thereunto glorified be god the pen is perplexed what to write and the tongue wondereth what to utter despite unprecedented hardships and after enduring years of imprisonment captivity and woeful trials we now perceive that veils thicker than the ones we have already torn asunder have intervened obstructing the vision and causing the light of understanding to be obscured moreover we observe that the fresh calumnies which are now rife are far more malicious than those of former days people of the bayán fear ye the merciful lord consider the people of former times what were their deeds and what fruit did they gather every thing they uttered was but imposture and whatever they wrought hath proved worthless except for those whom god hath graciously protected through his power swear by the life of him who is the desire of the world were man to ponder in his heart he would free of all attachment to the world hasten unto the most great light and would purge and purify himself from the dust of vain imaginings and the smoke of idle fancy what could have prompted the people of the past to err and by whom were they misled they still reject the truth and have turned towards their own selfish desires this wronged one calleth aloud for the sake of god whosoever wisheth let him turn thereunto whosoever wisheth let him turn away verily god can well afford to dispense with all things whether of the past or of the future people of the bayán it is men like unto hádí dawlat ábádí who with turban and staff have been the source of opposition and hindrance and have so grievously burdened the people with superstitions that even at the present time they still expect the appearance of fictitious person from fictitious place be ye warned men of understanding hádí give ear unto the voice of this trustworthy counselor direct thy steps from the left unto the right that is turn away from idle fancy unto certitude lead not the people into error the divine luminary shineth his cause is manifest and his signs are all embracing set thy face towards god the help in peril the self subsisting renounce thy leadership for the sake of god and leave the people unto themselves thou art ignorant of the essential truth thou art not acquainted therewith hádí be thou of one face in the path of god when in company with the infidels thou art an infidel and with the pious thou art pious reflect thou upon such souls as offered up their lives and their substance in that land that haply thou mayest be admonished and roused from slumber consider who is to be preferred he who preserveth his body his life and his possessions or the one who surrendereth his all in the path of god judge thou fairly and be not of the unjust take fast hold of justice and adhere unto equity that perchance thou mayest not for selfish motives use religion as snare nor disregard the truth for the sake of gold indeed thine iniquity and the iniquity of such people as thyself have waxed so grievous that the pen of glory was moved to make such observations fear thou god he who heralded this revelation hath declared “he shall proclaim under all conditions ‘verily verily am god no god is there but me the help in peril the self subsisting ’” people of the bayán ye have been forbidden to contact the loved ones of god why hath this ban been imposed and for what purpose be ye fair adjure you by god and be not of the heedless unto such as are endued with insight and before the most great beauty the object of this ban is known and evident it is so that no one may become aware of his hádí’s secrets and deeds hádí thou hast not been in our company thou art therefore ignorant of the cause act not according to thine idle imaginings aside from these things scrutinize the writings with thine own eyes and ponder upon that which hath come to pass have pity upon thyself and upon the servants of god and be not the cause of waywardness like unto the people aforetime the path is unmistakable and the proof is evident change injustice into justice and inequity into equity we cherish the hope that the breaths of divine inspiration may strengthen thee and that thine inner ear may be enabled to hear the blessed words “say it is god then leave them to entertain themselves with their cavillings thou hast been there cyprus and hast seen him mírzá yaḥyá now speak forth with fairness do not misrepresent the matter neither to thyself nor to the people thou art both ignorant and uninformed give ear unto the voice of this wronged one and hasten towards the ocean of divine knowledge that perchance thou mayest be adorned with the ornament of comprehension and mayest renounce all else but god hearken unto the voice of this benevolent counselor calling aloud unveiled and manifest before the faces of kings and their subjects and summon the people of the world one and all unto him who is the lord of eternity this is the word from whose horizon the daystar of unfailing grace shineth resplendent hádí this wronged one rid of all attachment to the world hath striven with utmost endeavor to quench the fire of animosity and hatred which burneth fiercely in the hearts of the peoples of the earth it behooveth every just and fair minded person to render thanks unto god—exalted be his glory—and to arise to promote this preeminent cause that fire may turn into light and hatred may give way to fellowship and love swear by the righteousness of god this is the sole purpose of this wronged one indeed in proclaiming this momentous cause and in demonstrating its truth we have endured manifold sufferings hardships and tribulations thou thyself wouldst bear witness unto that which we have mentioned couldst thou but speak with fairness verily god speaketh the truth and leadeth the way he is the powerful the mighty the gracious may our glory rest upon the people of bahá whom neither the tyranny of the oppressor nor the ascendancy of the aggressor have been able to withhold from god the lord of the worlds this is the epistle of god the help in peril the self subsisting he is the one who heareth from his realm of glory godtestifieth that there is none other god but him and that he who hath appeared is the hidden mystery the treasured symbol the most great book for all peoples and the heaven of bounty for the whole world he is the most mighty sign amongst men and the dayspring of the most august attributes in the realm of creation through him hath appeared that which had been hidden from time immemorial and been veiled from the eyes of men he is the one whose manifestation was announced by the heavenly scriptures in former times and more recently whoso acknowledgeth belief in him and in his signs and testimonies hath in truth acknowledged that which the tongue of grandeur uttered ere the creation of earth and heaven and the revelation of the kingdom of names through him the ocean of knowledge hath surged amidst mankind and the river of divine wisdom hath gushed out at the behest of god the lord of days well is it with the man of discernment who hath recognized and perceived the truth and the one possessed of hearing ear who hath hearkened unto his sweet voice and the hand that hath received his book with such resolve as is born of god the lord of this world and of the next and the earnest wayfarer who hath hastened unto his glorious horizon and the one endued with strength whom neither the overpowering might of the rulers nor the tumult raised by the leaders of religion hath been able to shake and woe betide him who hath rejected the grace of god and his bounty and hath denied his tender mercy and authority such man is indeed reckoned with those who have throughout eternity repudiated the testimony of god and his proof great is the blessedness of him who hath in this day cast away the things current amongst men and hath clung unto that which is ordained by god the lord of names and the fashioner of all created things he who is come from the heaven of eternity through the power of the most great name invested with so invincible an authority that all the powers of the earth are unable to withstand him unto this beareth witness the mother book calling from the most sublime station ‘alí akbar we have repeatedly heard thy voice and have responded to thee with that which the praise of all mankind can never rival from which the sincere ones inhale the sweet savors of the sayings of the all merciful and his true lovers perceive the fragrance of heavenly reunion and the sore athirst discover the murmuring of the water that is life indeed blessed the man who hath attained thereto and hath recognized that which is at this moment being diffused from the pen of god the help in peril the almighty the all bountiful we testify that thou hast set thy face towards god and traveled far until thou didst attain his presence and gavest ear unto the voice of this wronged one who hath been cast into prison through the misdeeds of those who have disbelieved in the signs and testimonies of god and have denied this heavenly grace through which the whole world hath been made to shine blessed thy face for it hath turned unto him and thine ear for it hath heard his voice and thy tongue for it hath celebrated the praise of god the lord of lords we pray god to graciously aid thee to become standard for the promotion of his cause and to enable thee to draw nigh unto him at all times and under all conditions the chosen ones of god and his loved ones in that land are remembered by us and we give them the joyful tidings of that which hath been sent down in their honor from the kingdom of the utterance of their lord the sovereign ruler of the day of reckoning make mention of me to them and illumine them with the resplendent glory of mine utterance verily thy lord is the gracious the bountiful thou who dost magnify my praise give ear unto that which the people of tyranny ascribe unto me in my days some of them say “he hath laid claim to divinity” others say “he hath devised lie against god” still others say “he is come to foment sedition base and wretched are they lo they are in truth enslaved to idle imaginings we shall now cease using the eloquent language truly thy lord is the potent the unconstrained we would fain speak in the persian tongue that perchance the people of persia one and all may become aware of the utterances of the merciful lord and come forth to discover the truth the first tajallíwhich hath dawned from the daystar of truth is the knowledge of god—exalted be his glory and the knowledge of the king of everlasting days can in no wise be attained save by recognizing him who is the bearer of the most great name he is in truth the speaker on sinai who is now seated upon the throne of revelation he is the hidden mystery and the treasured symbol all the former and latter books of god are adorned with his praise and extol his glory through him the standard of knowledge hath been planted in the world and the ensign of the oneness of god hath been unfurled amidst all peoples attainment unto the divine presence can be realized solely by attaining his presence through his potency everything that hath from time immemorial been veiled and hidden is now revealed he is made manifest through the power of truth and hath uttered word whereby all that are in the heavens and on the earth have been dumbfounded except those whom the almighty was pleased to exempt true belief in god and recognition of him cannot be complete save by acceptance of that which he hath revealed and by observance of whatsoever hath been decreed by him and set down in the book by the pen of glory they that immerse themselves in the ocean of his utterances should at all times have the utmost regard for the divinely revealed ordinances and prohibitions indeed his ordinances constitute the mightiest stronghold for the protection of the world and the safeguarding of its peoples—a light upon those who acknowledge and recognize the truth and fire unto such as turn away and deny the second tajallíis to remain steadfast in the cause of god—exalted be his glory—and to be unswerving in his love and this can in no wise be attained except through full recognition of him and full recognition cannot be obtained save by faith in the blessed words “he doeth whatsoever he willeth whoso tenaciously cleaveth unto this sublime word and drinketh deep from the living waters of utterance which are inherent therein will be imbued with such constancy that all the books of the world will be powerless to deter him from the mother book how glorious is this sublime station this exalted rank this ultimate purpose ‘alí akbar consider how abject is the state of the disbelievers they all give utterance to the words “verily he is to be praised in his deeds and is to be obeyed in his behest nevertheless if we reveal aught which even to the extent of needle’s eye runneth counter to their selfish ways and desires they will disdainfully reject it say none can ever fathom the manifold exigencies of god’s consummate wisdom in truth were he to pronounce the earth to be heaven no one hath the right to question his authority this is that whereunto the point of the bayán hath testified in all that was sent down unto him with truth at the behest of god he who hath caused the dawn to break the third tajallíis concerning arts crafts and sciences knowledge is as wings to man’s life and ladder for his ascent its acquisition is incumbent upon everyone the knowledge of such sciences however should be acquired as can profit the peoples of the earth and not those which begin with words and end with words great indeed is the claim of scientists and craftsmen on the peoples of the world unto this beareth witness the mother book on the day of his return happy are those possessed of hearing ear in truth knowledge is veritable treasure for man and source of glory of bounty of joy of exaltation of cheer and gladness unto him thus hath the tongue of grandeur spoken in this most great prison the fourth tajallíis concerning divinity godhead and the like were man of insight to direct his gaze towards the blessed the manifest lote tree and its fruits he would be so enriched thereby as to be independent of aught else and to acknowledge his belief in that which the speaker on sinai hath uttered from the throne of revelation ‘alí akbar acquaint the people with the holy verses of thy lord and make known unto them his straight path his mighty announcement say people if ye judge fairly and equitably ye will testify to the truth of whatsoever hath streamed forth from the most exalted pen if ye be of the people of the bayán the persian bayán will guide you aright and will prove sufficient testimony unto you and if ye be of the people of the qur’án ponder ye upon the revelation on sinai and the voice from the bush which came unto the son of ‘imrán moses gracious god it was intended that at the time of the manifestation of the one true god the faculty of recognizing him would have been developed and matured and would have reached its culmination however it is now clearly demonstrated that in the disbelievers this faculty hath remained undeveloped and hath indeed degenerated ‘alí that which they accepted from the bush they now refuse to accept from him who is the tree of the world of existence say people of the bayán speak not according to the dictates of passion and selfish desire most of the peoples of the earth attest the truth of the blessed word which hath come forth from the bush by the righteousness of god but for the anthem of praise voiced by him who heralded the divine revelation this wronged one would never have breathed word which might have struck terror into the hearts of the ignorant and caused them to perish dwelling on the glorification of him whom god shall make manifest—exalted be his manifestation—the báb in the beginning of the bayán saith “he is the one who shall proclaim under all conditions “verily verily am god no god is there but me the lord of all created things in truth all others except me are my creatures my creatures me alone do ye worship ’” likewise in another instance he magnifying the name of him who shall be made manifest saith “i would be the first to adore him now it behooveth one to reflect upon the significance of the “adorer” and the “adored one that perchance the people of the earth may partake of dewdrop from the ocean of divine knowledge and may be enabled to perceive the greatness of this revelation verily he hath appeared and hath unloosed his tongue to proclaim the truth well is it with him who doth acknowledge and recognize the truth and woe betide the froward and the wayward kindreds of the earth incline your ears unto the voice from the divine lote tree which overshadoweth the world and be not of the people of tyranny on earth—men who have repudiated the manifestation of god and his invincible authority and have renounced his favors—they in truth are reckoned with the contemptible in the book of god the lord of all mankind the glory which hath dawned above the horizon of my tender mercy rest upon thee and upon whosoever is with thee and giveth ear to thy words concerning the cause of god the almighty the all praised he is the one who speaketh through the power of truth in the kingdom of utterance yethe embodiments of justice and equity and the manifestations of uprightness and of heavenly bounties in tears and lamenting this wronged one calleth aloud and saith god my god adorn the heads of thy loved ones with the crown of detachment and attire their temples with the raiment of righteousness it behooveth the people of bahá to render the lord victorious through the power of their utterance and to admonish the people by their goodly deeds and character inasmuch as deeds exert greater influence than words ḥaydar ‘alí upon thee be the praise of god and his glory say honesty virtue wisdom and saintly character redound to the exaltation of man while dishonesty imposture ignorance and hypocrisy lead to his abasement by my life man’s distinction lieth not in ornaments or wealth but rather in virtuous behavior and true understanding most of the people in persia are steeped in deception and idle fancy how great the difference between the condition of these people and the station of such valiant souls as have passed beyond the sea of names and pitched their tents upon the shores of the ocean of detachment indeed none but few of the existing generation hath yet earned the merit of hearkening unto the warblings of the doves of the all highest paradise “few of my servants are truly thankful people for the most part delight in superstitions they regard single drop of the sea of delusion as preferable to an ocean of certitude by holding fast unto names they deprive themselves of the inner reality and by clinging to vain imaginings they are kept back from the dayspring of heavenly signs god grant you may be graciously aided under all conditions to shatter the idols of superstition and to tear away the veils of the imaginations of men authority lieth in the grasp of god the fountainhead of revelation and inspiration and the lord of the day of resurrection we heard that which the person in question hath mentioned regarding certain teachers of the faith indeed he hath spoken truly some heedless souls roam the lands in the name of god actively engaged in ruining his cause and call it promoting and teaching the word of god and this notwithstanding that the qualifications of the teachers of the faith like unto stars shine resplendent throughout the heavens of the divine tablets every fair minded person testifieth and every man of insight is well aware that the one true god—exalted be his glory—hath unceasingly set forth and expounded that which will elevate the station and will exalt the rank of the children of men the people of bahá burn brightly amidst the gatherings even as candle and hold fast unto that which god hath purposed this station standeth supreme above all stations well is it with him who hath cast away the things that the people of the world possess yearning for that which pertaineth unto god the sovereign lord of eternity say god my god thou beholdest me circling round thy will with mine eyes turned towards the horizon of thy bounty eagerly awaiting the revelation of the effulgent splendors of the sun of thy favors beg of thee beloved of every understanding heart and the desire of such as have near access unto thee to grant that thy loved ones may become wholly detached from their own inclinations holding fast unto that which pleaseth thee attire them lord with the robe of righteousness and illumine them with the splendors of the light of detachment summon then to their assistance the hosts of wisdom and utterance that they may exalt thy word amongst thy creatures and proclaim thy cause amidst thy servants verily potent art thou to do what thou willest and within thy grasp lie the reins of all affairs no god is there but thee the mighty the ever forgiving thou who hast turned thy gaze towards my face in these days there occurred that which hath plunged me into dire sadness certain wrong doers who profess allegiance to the cause of god committed such deeds as have caused the limbs of sincerity of honesty of justice of equity to quake one known individual to whom the utmost kindness and favor had been extended perpetrated such acts as have brought tears to the eye of god formerly we uttered words of warning and premonition then for number of years we kept the matter secret that haply he might take heed and repent but all to no purpose in the end he bent his energies upon vilifying the cause of god before the eyes of all men he tore the veil of fairness asunder and felt sympathy neither for himself nor for the cause of god now however the deeds of certain individuals have brought sorrows far more grievous than those which the deeds of the former had caused beseech thou god the true one that he may graciously enable the heedless to retract and repent verily he is the forgiving the bountiful the most generous in these days it is incumbent upon everyone to adhere tenaciously unto unity and concord and to labor diligently in promoting the cause of god that perchance the wayward souls may attain that which will lead unto abiding prosperity in brief dissensions among various sects have opened the way to weakness each sect hath picked out way for itself and is clinging to certain cord despite manifest blindness and ignorance they pride themselves on their insight and knowledge among them are mystics who bear allegiance to the faith of islám some of whom indulge in that which leadeth to idleness and seclusion swear by god it lowereth man’s station and maketh him swell with pride man must bring forth fruit one who yieldeth no fruit is in the words of the spirit like unto fruitless tree and fruitless tree is fit but for the fire that which the aforesaid persons have mentioned concerning the stations of divine unity will conduce in no small measure to idleness and vain imaginings these mortal men have evidently set aside the differences of station and have come to regard themselves as god while god is immeasurably exalted above all things every created being however revealeth his signs which are but emanations from him and not his own self all these signs are reflected and can be seen in the book of existence and the scrolls that depict the shape and pattern of the universe are indeed most great book therein every man of insight can perceive that which would lead to the straight path and would enable him to attain the great announcement consider the rays of the sun whose light hath encompassed the world the rays emanate from the sun and reveal its nature but are not the sun itself whatsoever can be discerned on earth amply demonstrateth the power of god his knowledge and the outpourings of his bounty while he himself is immeasurably exalted above all creatures christ saith “thou hast granted to children that whereof the learned and the wise are deprived the sage of sabzívar hath said “alas attentive ears are lacking otherwise the whisperings of the sinaic bush could be heard from every tree in tablet to man of wisdom who had made enquiry as to the meaning of elementary reality we addressed this famous sage in these words “if this saying is truly thine how is it that thou hast failed to hearken unto the call which the tree of man hath raised from the loftiest heights of the world if thou didst hear the call yet fear and the desire to preserve thy life prompted thee to remain heedless to it thou art such person as hath never been nor is worthy of mention if thou hast not heard it then thou art bereft of the sense of hearing in brief such men are they whose words are the pride of the world and whose deeds are the shame of the nations verily we have sounded the trumpet which is none other than my pen of glory and lo mankind hath swooned away before it save them whom god pleaseth to deliver as token of his grace he is the lord of bounty the ancient of days say concourse of divines pronounce ye censure against this pen unto which as soon as it raised its shrill voice the kingdom of utterance prepared itself to hearken and before whose mighty and glorious theme every other theme hath paled into insignificance fear ye god and follow not your idle fancies and corrupt imaginings but rather follow him who is come unto you invested with undeniable knowledge and unshakeable certitude glorified be god man’s treasure is his utterance yet this wronged one hath withheld his tongue for the disbelievers are lying in ambush however protection is afforded by god the lord of all worlds verily in him have we placed our trust and unto him have we committed all affairs all sufficient is he for us and for all created things he is the one by whose leave and through the potency of whose command the daystar of sovereign might hath shone resplendent above the horizon of the world well is it with him who perceiveth and recognizeth the truth and woe betide the froward and the faithless this wronged one hath invariably treated the wise with affection by the wise is meant men whose knowledge is not confined to mere words and whose lives have been fruitful and have produced enduring results it is incumbent upon everyone to honor these blessed souls happy are they that observe god’s precepts happy are they that have recognized the truth happy are they that judge with fairness in all matters and hold fast to the cord of my inviolable justice the people of persia have turned away from him who is the protector and the helper they are clinging to and have enmeshed themselves in the vain imaginings of the foolish so firmly do they adhere to superstitions that naught can sever them therefrom save the potent arm of god—exalted is his glory beseech thou the almighty that he may remove with the fingers of divine power the veils which have shut out the divers peoples and kindreds that they may attain the things that are conducive to security progress and advancement and may hasten forth towards the incomparable friend the word of god which the abhá pen hath revealed and inscribed on thefirst leafof the most exalted paradise is this verily say the fear of god hath ever been sure defense and safe stronghold for all the peoples of the world it is the chief cause of the protection of mankind and the supreme instrument for its preservation indeed there existeth in man faculty which deterreth him from and guardeth him against whatever is unworthy and unseemly and which is known as his sense of shame this however is confined to but few all have not possessed and do not possess it the word of god which the supreme pen hath recorded on thesecond leafof the most exalted paradise is the following the pen of the most high exhorteth at this moment the manifestations of authority and the sources of power namely the kings the sovereigns the presidents the rulers the divines and the wise and enjoineth them to uphold the cause of religion and to cleave unto it religion is verily the chief instrument for the establishment of order in the world and of tranquility amongst its peoples the weakening of the pillars of religion hath strengthened the foolish and emboldened them and made them more arrogant verily say the greater the decline of religion the more grievous the waywardness of the ungodly this cannot but lead in the end to chaos and confusion hear me men of insight and be warned ye who are endued with discernment the word of god which the supreme pen hath recorded on thethird leafof the most exalted paradise is this son of man if thine eyes be turned towards mercy forsake the things that profit thee and cleave unto that which will profit mankind and if thine eyes be turned towards justice choose thou for thy neighbor that which thou choosest for thyself humility exalteth man to the heaven of glory and power whilst pride abaseth him to the depths of wretchedness and degradation people of god great is the day and mighty the call in one of our tablets we have revealed these exalted words “were the world of the spirit to be wholly converted into the sense of hearing it could then claim to be worthy to hearken unto the voice that calleth from the supreme horizon for otherwise these ears that are defiled with lying tales have never been nor are they now fit to hear it well is it with them that hearken and woe betide the wayward the word of god which the supreme pen hath recorded on thefourth leafof the most exalted paradise is the following people of god beseech ye the true one—glorified be his name—that he may graciously shield the manifestations of dominion and power from the suggestions of self and desire and shed the radiance of justice and guidance upon them his majesty muḥammadsháh despite the excellence of his rank committed two heinous deeds one was the order to banish the lord of the realms of grace and bounty the primal point and the other the murder of the prince of the city of statesmanship and literary accomplishment the faults of kings like their favors can be great king who is not deterred by the vainglory of power and authority from observing justice nor is deprived of the splendors of the daystar of equity by luxury riches glory or the marshalling of hosts and legions shall occupy high rank and sublime station amongst the concourse on high it is incumbent upon everyone to extend aid and to manifest kindness to so noble soul well is it with the king who keepeth tight hold on the reins of his passion restraineth his anger and preferreth justice and fairness to injustice and tyranny the word of god which the supreme pen hath recorded on thefifth leafof the most exalted paradise is this above all else the greatest gift and the most wondrous blessing hath ever been and will continue to be wisdom it is man’s unfailing protector it aideth him and strengtheneth him wisdom is god’s emissary and the revealer of his name the omniscient through it the loftiness of man’s station is made manifest and evident it is all knowing and the foremost teacher in the school of existence it is the guide and is invested with high distinction thanks to its educating influence earthly beings have become imbued with gem like spirit which outshineth the heavens in the city of justice it is the unrivalled speaker who in the year nine illumined the world with the joyful tidings of this revelation and it was this peerless source of wisdom that at the beginning of the foundation of the world ascended the stair of inner meaning and when enthroned upon the pulpit of utterance through the operation of the divine will proclaimed two words the first heralded the promise of reward while the second voiced the ominous warning of punishment the promise gave rise to hope and the warning begat fear thus the basis of world order hath been firmly established upon these twin principles exalted is the lord of wisdom the possessor of great bounty the word of god which the supreme pen hath recorded on thesixth leafof the most exalted paradise is the following the light of men is justice quench it not with the contrary winds of oppression and tyranny the purpose of justice is the appearance of unity among men the ocean of divine wisdom surgeth within this exalted word while the books of the world cannot contain its inner significance were mankind to be adorned with this raiment they would behold the daystar of the utterance “on that day god will satisfy everyone out of his abundance shining resplendent above the horizon of the world appreciate ye the value of this utterance it is noble fruit that the tree of the pen of glory hath yielded happy is the man that giveth ear unto it and observeth its precepts verily say whatever is sent down from the heaven of the will of god is the means for the establishment of order in the world and the instrument for promoting unity and fellowship among its peoples thus hath the tongue of this wronged one spoken from his most great prison the word of god which the supreme pen hath recorded on theseventh leafof the most exalted paradise is this ye men of wisdom among nations shut your eyes to estrangement then fix your gaze upon unity cleave tenaciously unto that which will lead to the well being and tranquility of all mankind this span of earth is but one homeland and one habitation it behooveth you to abandon vainglory which causeth alienation and to set your hearts on whatever will ensure harmony in the estimation of the people of bahá man’s glory lieth in his knowledge his upright conduct his praiseworthy character his wisdom and not in his nationality or rank people of the earth appreciate the value of this heavenly word indeed it may be likened unto ship for the ocean of knowledge and shining luminary for the realm of perception the word of god which the supreme pen hath recorded on theeighth leafof the most exalted paradise is the following schools must first train the children in the principles of religion so that the promise and the threat recorded in the books of god may prevent them from the things forbidden and adorn them with the mantle of the commandments but this in such measure that it may not injure the children by resulting in ignorant fanaticism and bigotry it is incumbent upon the trustees of the house of justice to take counsel together regarding those things which have not outwardly been revealed in the book and to enforce that which is agreeable to them god will verily inspire them with whatsoever he willeth and he verily is the provider the omniscient we have formerly ordained that people should converse in two languages yet efforts must be made to reduce them to one likewise the scripts of the world that men’s lives may not be dissipated and wasted in learning divers languages thus the whole earth would come to be regarded as one city and one land the word of god which the supreme pen hath recorded on theninth leafof the most exalted paradise is this in all matters moderation is desirable if thing is carried to excess it will prove source of evil consider the civilization of the west how it hath agitated and alarmed the peoples of the world an infernal engine hath been devised and hath proved so cruel weapon of destruction that its like none hath ever witnessed or heard the purging of such deeply rooted and overwhelming corruptions cannot be effected unless the peoples of the world unite in pursuit of one common aim and embrace one universal faith incline your ears unto the call of this wronged one and adhere firmly to the lesser peace strange and astonishing things exist in the earth but they are hidden from the minds and the understanding of men these things are capable of changing the whole atmosphere of the earth and their contamination would prove lethal great god we have observed an amazing thing lightning or force similar to it is controlled by an operator and moveth at his command immeasurably exalted is the lord of power who hath laid bare that which he purposed through the potency of his weighty and invincible command people of bahá each one of the ordinances we have revealed is mighty stronghold for the preservation of the world of being verily this wronged one desireth naught but your security and elevation we exhort the men of the house of justice and command them to ensure the protection and safeguarding of men women and children it is incumbent upon them to have the utmost regard for the interests of the people at all times and under all conditions blessed is the ruler who succoureth the captive and the rich one who careth for the poor and the just one who secureth from the wrong doer the rights of the downtrodden and happy the trustee who observeth that which the ordainer the ancient of days hath prescribed unto him ḥaydar ‘alí upon thee be my glory and my praise my counsels and admonitions have compassed the world yet instead of imparting joy and gladness they have caused grief because some of those who claim to love me have waxed haughty and have inflicted upon me such tribulations as neither the followers of former religions nor the divines of persia did ever inflict we have said “my imprisonment doeth me no harm nor do the things that have befallen me at the hands of my enemies that which harmeth me is the conduct of my loved ones who though they bear my name yet commit that which maketh my heart and my pen to lament such utterances as these have again and again been revealed yet the heedless have failed to profit thereby since they are captive to their own evil passions and corrupt desires beseech thou the one true god that he may enable everyone to repent and return unto him so long as one’s nature yieldeth unto evil passions crime and transgression will prevail we cherish the hope that the hand of divine power and the outpouring of heavenly blessings may sustain all men may attire them with the vesture of forgiveness and bounty and guard them against that which would harm his cause among his servants he is in truth the potent the all powerful and he is the ever forgiving the merciful the word of god which the supreme pen hath recorded on thetenth leafof the most exalted paradise is the following people of the earth living in seclusion or practicing asceticism is not acceptable in the presence of god it behooveth them that are endued with insight and understanding to observe that which will cause joy and radiance such practices as are sprung from the loins of idle fancy or are begotten of the womb of superstition ill beseem men of knowledge in former times and more recently some people have been taking up their abodes in the caves of the mountains while others have repaired to graveyards at night say give ear unto the counsels of this wronged one abandon the things current amongst you and adopt that which the faithful counselor biddeth you deprive not yourselves of the bounties which have been created for your sake charity is pleasing and praiseworthy in the sight of god and is regarded as prince among goodly deeds consider ye and call to mind that which the all merciful hath revealed in the qur’án “they prefer them before themselves though poverty be their own lot and with such as are preserved from their own covetousness shall it be well viewed in this light the blessed utterance above is in truth the daystar of utterances blessed is he who preferreth his brother before himself verily such man is reckoned by virtue of the will of god the all knowing the all wise with the people of bahá who dwell in the crimson ark the word of god which the supreme pen hath recorded on theeleventh leafof the most exalted paradise is this we enjoin upon them that are the emblems of his names and attributes to firmly adhere henceforth unto that which hath been set forth in this most great revelation not to allow themselves to become the cause of strife and until the end that knoweth no end to keep their eyes directed towards the dayspring of these resplendent words which have been recorded in this tablet strife leads to bloodshed and provokes commotion amongst people hearken ye unto the voice of this wronged one and deviate not therefrom were anyone to ponder in his heart that which hath in this revelation streamed forth from the pen of glory he would be assured that whatever this wronged one hath affirmed he hath had no intention of establishing any position or distinction for himself the purpose hath rather been to attract the souls through the sublimity of his words unto the summit of transcendent glory and to endow them with the capacity of perceiving that which will purge and purify the peoples of the world from the strife and dissension which religious differences provoke unto this bear witness my heart my pen my inner and my outer being god grant that all men may turn unto the treasuries latent within their own beings people of bahá the source of crafts sciences and arts is the power of reflection make ye every effort that out of this ideal mine there may gleam forth such pearls of wisdom and utterance as will promote the well being and harmony of all the kindreds of the earth under all conditions whether in adversity or at ease whether honored or afflicted this wronged one hath directed all men to show forth love affection compassion and harmony and yet whenever there was any slight evidence of progress and advancement those concealed behind the veils would sally forth and utter calumnies more wounding than the sword they cling unto misleading and reprehensible words and suffer themselves to be deprived of the ocean of verses revealed by god if these obstructing veils had not intervened persia would in some two years have been subdued through the power of utterance the position of both the government and the people would have been raised and the supreme goal unveiled and unconcealed would have appeared in the plenitude of glory in short sometimes in explicit language at other times by allusion we said whatever had to be said thus once persia had been rehabilitated the sweet savors of the word of god would have wafted over all countries inasmuch as that which hath streamed forth from the most exalted pen is conducive to the glory the advancement and education of all the peoples and kindreds of the earth indeed it is the sovereign remedy for every disease could they but comprehend and perceive it recently the afnáns and amín—upon them be my glory and loving kindness—attained our presence and beheld our countenance likewise nabíl the son of nabíl and the son of samandar—upon them rest the glory of god and his loving kindness—are present and have drunk the cup of reunion we entreat god that he may graciously ordain for them the good of this world and of the next and that the outpouring of his blessings and grace may descend upon them from the heaven of his generosity and the clouds of his tender compassion verily of those who show mercy he is the most merciful and he is the gracious the beneficent ḥaydar ‘alí thine other letter which thou hadst forwarded through him who beareth the title of júd bounty hath reached our holy court praised be god it was adorned with the light of divine unity and of detachment and was ablaze with the fire of love and affection pray thou unto god that he may grant keenness to the eyes and illumine them with new light perchance they may perceive that which hath no parallel nor peer in this day the verses of the mother book are resplendent and unmistakable even as the sun they can in no wise be mistaken for any of the past or more recent utterances truly this wronged one desireth not to demonstrate his own cause with proofs produced by others he is the one who embraceth all things while all else besides him is circumscribed say people peruse that which is current amongst you and we will peruse what pertaineth unto us swear by god neither the praise of the peoples of the world nor the things that the kindreds of the earth possess are worthy of mention before the remembrance of his name unto this beareth witness he who under all conditions proclaimeth “verily he is god the sovereign ruler of the day of reckoning and the lord of the mighty throne glorified be god one wondereth by what proof or reason the disbelievers among the people of the bayán have turned away from the lord of being in truth the station of this revelation transcendeth the station of whatever hath been manifested in the past or will be made manifest in the future were the point of the bayán present in this day and should he god forbid hesitate to acknowledge this cause then the very blessed words which have streamed forth from the wellspring of his own bayán would apply to him he saith and his word is the truth “lawful is it for him whom god will make manifest to reject him who is the greatest on earth say ye that are bereft of understanding today that most exalted being is proclaiming “verily verily am the first to adore him how shallow is the fund of men’s knowledge and how feeble their power of perception our pen of glory beareth witness to their abject poverty and to the wealth of god the lord of all worlds lauded and glorified is he who hath called the creation into being he is the sovereign truth the knower of things unseen the mother book is revealed and the lord of bounty is established upon the most blessed seat of glory the dawn hath broken yet the people understand not the signs have been ushered in while he who hath revealed them is overwhelmed with manifest sorrow indeed have endured that which hath caused the world of existence to lament say yaḥyá azal produce single verse if thou dost possess divinely inspired knowledge these words were formerly spoken by my herald who at this hour proclaimeth “verily verily am the first to adore him

hast thou any power before the revelations of mine omnipotence judge thou fairly adjure thee by god and call to mind when thou didst stand in the presence of this wronged one and we dictated to thee the verses of god the help in peril the self subsisting beware lest the source of falsehood withhold thee from the manifest truth thou who hast fixed thy gaze upon my countenance say ye heedless ones by reason of droplet ye have deprived yourselves of the ocean of heavenly verses and for the sake of an insignificant atom ye have shut yourselves out from the splendors of the daystar of truth who else but bahá hath the power to speak forth before the face of mankind judge ye fairly and be not of the unjust through him the oceans have surged the mysteries have been divulged and the trees have lifted up their voices exclaiming the kingdoms of earth and heaven are god’s the revealer of signs the fountainhead of clear tokens peruse ye the persian bayán revealed by him who heralded this revelation and look at it with the eye of fairness verily he will guide you aright to his path at this moment he proclaimeth that which his tongue had formerly uttered when he was seated upon the throne of his most exalted name thou hast made mention of the loved ones in those regions praised be god each one of them attained the honor of being remembered by the true one—exalted is his glory—and the names of them one and all flowed from the tongue of grandeur in the kingdom of utterance great indeed is their blessedness and happiness inasmuch as they have drunk the choice wine of revelation and inspiration from the hand of their lord the compassionate the merciful we beseech god to strengthen them to manifest inflexible constancy and to summon to their aid the hosts of wisdom and utterance he is in truth the mighty the omnipotent convey my greetings to them and give them the joyful tidings that the daystar of remembrance hath dawned and shed its radiance from above the horizon of the bountiful favors of their lord the ever forgiving the all merciful thou hast mentioned ḥusayn we have attired his temple with the robe of forgiveness and adorned his head with the crown of pardon it beseemeth him to pride himself among all men upon this resplendent this radiant and manifest bounty say be not despondent after the revelation of this blessed verse it is as though thou hast been born anew from thy mother’s womb say thou art free from sin and error truly god hath purged thee with the living waters of his utterance in his most great prison we entreat him—blessed and exalted is he—to graciously confirm thee in extolling him and in magnifying his glory and to strengthen thee through the power of his invisible hosts verily he is the almighty the omnipotent thou hast made mention of the people of tár we have set our face toward the servants of god therein and advise them first to consider that which the point of the bayán hath revealed concerning this revelation whereby all names and titles have been shaken the idols of vain imaginings have crumbled and the tongue of grandeur hath from the realm of glory proclaimed by the righteousness of god the hidden treasure the impenetrable mystery hath been uncovered to men’s eyes causing all things whether of the past or of the future to rejoice he hath said and his word is the truth “of all the tributes have paid to him who is to come after me the greatest is this my written confession that no words of mine can adequately describe him nor can any reference to him in my book the bayán do justice to his cause moreover we counsel them to observe justice equity honesty piety and that whereby both the word of god and their own station will be exalted amongst men verily am the one who exhorteth with justice unto this beareth witness he from whose pen rivers of mercy have flowed and from whose utterance fountains of living waters have streamed forth unto all created things immeasurably exalted is

be effaced and remaineth unaffected by the doubts of the froward cast away the things current amongst men and take fast hold on that whereunto ye are bidden by virtue of the will of the ordainer the ancient of days this is the day wherein the divine lote tree calleth aloud saying people behold ye my fruits and my leaves incline then your ears unto my rustling beware lest the doubts of men debar you from the light of certitude the ocean of utterance exclaimeth and saith “o ye dwellers on the earth behold my billowing waters and the pearls of wisdom and utterance which have poured forth fear

rejoicing it behooveth everyone to hasten towards the court of his nearness with exceeding joy gladness exultation and delight and to deliver himself from the fire of remoteness people of tár through the strengthening power of my name seize ye the chalice of knowledge drink then your fill in defiance of the people of the world who have broken the covenant of god and his testament rejected his proofs and clear tokens and caviled at his signs which have pervaded all that are in heaven and on earth the disbelievers among the people of the bayán are like the followers of theshí‘ih sect and walk in their footsteps leave them to their idle fancies and vain imaginings they are in truth accounted with the lost in the book of god the all knowing the all wise theshí‘ih divines one and all are now engaged in reviling and denouncing the true one from their pulpits gracious god dawlat ábádí too hath followed suit he ascended the pulpit and gave voice to that which hath caused the tablet to cry out in anguish and the pen to wail meditate upon his conduct and the conduct of ashraf —upon him be my glory and my tender mercy—and likewise consider those loved ones who hastened to the place of martyrdom in my name and offered up their lives in the path of him who is the desire of the world the cause is manifest it shineth resplendent as the sun but the people have become veils unto

shone forth and the truth hath been established that the authority to choose rests with god the powerful the mighty the unconstrained through whom the ocean of bounty hath surged and the fragrance of the gracious favors of god the lord of mankind hath been diffused we beseech him—exalted is he—to shield them through the power of his hosts to protect them through the potency of his dominion and to aid them through his indomitable strength which prevaileth over all created things sovereignty is god’s the creator of the heavens and the lord of the kingdom of names the great announcement proclaimeth people of persia in former times ye have been the symbols of mercy and the embodiments of affection and kindliness the regions of the world were illumined and embellished by the brightness of the light of your knowledge and by the blaze of your erudition how is it that you have arisen to destroy yourselves and your friends with your own hands afnán thou that hast branched from mine ancient stock my glory and my loving kindness rest upon thee how vast is the tabernacle of the cause of god it hath overshadowed all the peoples and kindreds of the earth and will ere long gather together the whole of mankind beneath its shelter thy day of service is now come countless tablets bear the testimony of the bounties vouchsafed unto thee arise for the triumph of my cause and through the power of thine utterance subdue the hearts of men thou must show forth that which will ensure the peace and the well being of the miserable and the downtrodden gird up the loins of thine endeavor that perchance thou mayest release the captive from his chains and enable him to attain unto true liberty justice is in this day bewailing its plight and equity groaneth beneath the yoke of oppression the thick clouds of tyranny have darkened the face of the earth and enveloped its peoples through the movement of our pen of glory we have at the bidding of the omnipotent ordainer breathed new life into every human frame and instilled into every word fresh potency all created things proclaim the evidences of this worldwide regeneration this is the most great the most joyful tidings imparted by the pen of this wronged one to mankind wherefore fear ye my well beloved ones who is it that can dismay you touch of moisture sufficeth to dissolve the hardened clay out of which this perverse generation is molded the mere act of your gathering together is enough to scatter the forces of these vain and worthless people strife and conflict befit the beasts of the wild it was through the grace of god and with the aid of seemly words and praiseworthy deeds that the unsheathed swords of the bábí community were returned to their scabbards indeed through the power of good words the righteous have always succeeded in winning command over the meads of the hearts of men say ye loved ones do not forsake prudence incline your hearts to the counsels given by the most exalted pen and beware lest your hands or tongues cause harm unto anyone among mankind referring to the land of tá ṭihrán we have revealed in the kitáb aqdas that which will admonish mankind they that perpetrate tyranny in the world have usurped the rights of the peoples and kindreds of the earth and are sedulously pursuing their selfish inclinations the tyrant of the land of yá yazd committed that which hath caused the concourse on high to shed tears of blood thou who hast quaffed from the wine of mine utterance and hast fixed thy gaze upon the horizon of my revelation how strange that the people of persia who were unrivalled in sciences and arts should have sunk to the lowest level of degradation among the kindreds of the earth people in this blessed this glorious day deprive not yourselves of the liberal effusions of bounty which the lord of abounding grace hath vouchsafed unto you in this day showers of wisdom and utterance are pouring down from the clouds of divine mercy well is it with them who judge his cause with fairness and woe betide the unjust every man of insight will in this day readily admit that the counsels which the pen of this wronged one hath revealed constitute the supreme animating power for the advancement of the world and the exaltation of its peoples arise people and by the power of god’s might resolve to gain the victory over your own selves that haply the whole earth may be freed and sanctified from its servitude to the gods of its idle fancies—gods that have inflicted such loss upon and are responsible for the misery of their wretched worshippers these idols form the obstacle that impedeth man in his efforts to advance in the path of perfection we cherish the hope that the hand of divine power may lend its assistance to mankind and deliver it from its state of grievous abasement in one of the tablets these words have been revealed people of god do not busy yourselves in your own concerns let your thoughts be fixed upon that which will rehabilitate the fortunes of mankind and sanctify the hearts and souls of men this can best be achieved through pure and holy deeds through virtuous life and goodly behavior valiant acts will ensure the triumph of this cause and saintly character will reinforce its power cleave unto righteousness people of bahá this verily is the commandment which this wronged one hath given unto you and the first choice of his unrestrained will for every one of you friends it behooveth you to refresh and revive your souls through the gracious favors which in this divine this soul stirring springtime are being showered upon you the daystar of his great glory hath shed its radiance upon you and the clouds of his limitless grace have overshadowed you how high the reward of him that hath not deprived himself of so great bounty nor failed to recognize the beauty of his best beloved in this his new attire watch over yourselves for the evil one is lying in wait ready to entrap you gird yourselves against his wicked devices and led by the light of the name of the all seeing god make your escape from the darkness that surroundeth you let your vision be world embracing rather than confined to your own self the evil one is he that hindereth the rise and obstructeth the spiritual progress of the children of men it is incumbent upon every man in this day to hold fast unto whatsoever will promote the interests and exalt the station of all nations and just governments through each and every one of the verses which the pen of the most high hath revealed the doors of love and unity have been unlocked and flung open to the face of men we have erewhile declared—and our word is the truth— “consort with the followers of all religions in spirit of friendliness and fellowship whatsoever hath led the children of men to shun one another and hath caused dissensions and divisions amongst them hath through the revelation of these words been nullified and abolished from the heaven of god’s will and for the purpose of ennobling the world of being and of elevating the minds and souls of men hath been sent down that which is the most effective instrument for the education of the whole human race the highest essence and most perfect expression of whatsoever the peoples of old have either said or written hath through this most potent revelation been sent down from the heaven of the will of the all possessing the ever abiding god of old it hath been revealed “love of one’s country is an element of the faith of god the tongue of grandeur hath however in the day of his manifestation proclaimed “it is not his to boast who loveth his country but it is his who loveth the world through the power released by these exalted words he hath lent fresh impulse and set new direction to the birds of men’s hearts and hath obliterated every trace of restriction and limitation from god’s holy book this wronged one hath forbidden the people of god to engage in contention or conflict and hath exhorted them to righteous deeds and praiseworthy character in this day the hosts that can ensure the victory of the cause are those of goodly conduct and saintly character blessed are they who firmly adhere unto them and woe betide such as turn away therefrom people of god admonish you to observe courtesy for above all else it is the prince of virtues well is it with him who is illumined with the light of courtesy and is attired with the vesture of uprightness whoso is endued with courtesy hath indeed attained sublime station it is hoped that this wronged one and everyone else may be enabled to acquire it hold fast unto it observe it and fix our gaze upon it this is binding command which hath streamed forth from the pen of the most great name this is the day when the gems of constancy that lie hid in the mine of men’s inner selves should be made manifest people of justice be as brilliant as the light and as splendid as the fire that blazed in the burning bush the brightness of the fire of your love will no doubt fuse and unify the contending peoples and kindreds of the earth whilst the fierceness of the flame of enmity and hatred cannot but result in strife and ruin we beseech god that he may shield his creatures from the evil designs of his enemies he verily hath power over all things all praise be to the one true god—exalted be his glory—inasmuch as he hath through the pen of the most high unlocked the doors of men’s hearts every verse which this pen hath revealed is bright and shining portal that discloseth the glories of saintly and pious life of pure and stainless deeds the summons and the message which we gave were never intended to reach or to benefit one land or one people only mankind in its entirety must firmly adhere to whatsoever hath been revealed and vouchsafed unto it then and only then will it attain unto true liberty the whole earth is illuminated with the resplendent glory of god’s revelation in the year sixty he who heralded the light of divine guidance—may all creation be sacrifice unto him—arose to announce fresh revelation of the divine spirit and was followed twenty years later by him through whose coming the world was made the recipient of this promised glory this wondrous favor behold how the generality of mankind hath been endued with the capacity to hearken unto god’s most exalted word—the word upon which must depend the gathering together and spiritual resurrection of all men whilst in the prison of akká we revealed in the crimson book that which is conducive to the advancement of mankind and to the reconstruction of the world the utterances set forth therein by the pen of the lord of creation include the following which constitute the fundamental principles for the administration of the affairs of men first it is incumbent upon the ministers of the house of justice to promote the lesser peace so that the people of the earth may be relieved from the burden of exorbitant expenditures this matter is imperative and absolutely essential inasmuch as hostilities and conflict lie at the root of affliction and calamity second languages must be reduced to one common language to be taught in all the schools of the world third it behooveth man to adhere tenaciously unto that which will promote fellowship kindliness and unity fourth everyone whether man or woman should hand over to trusted person portion of what he or she earneth through trade agriculture or other occupation for the training and education of children to be spent for this purpose with the knowledge of the trustees of the house of justice fifth special regard must be paid to agriculture although it hath been mentioned in the fifth place unquestionably it precedeth the others agriculture is highly developed in foreign lands however in persia it hath so far been grievously neglected it is hoped that his majesty thesháh—may god assist him by his grace—will turn his attention to this vital and important matter were men to strictly observe that which the pen of the most high hath revealed in the crimson book they could then well afford to dispense with the regulations which prevail in the world certain exhortations have repeatedly streamed forth from the pen of the most high that perchance the manifestations of power and the dawning places of might may sometime be enabled to enforce them indeed were sincere seekers to be found every emanation of god’s pervasive and irresistible will would for the sake of his love be revealed but where are to be found earnest seekers and inquiring minds whither are gone the equitable and the fair minded at present no day passeth without the fire of fresh tyranny blazing fiercely or the sword of new aggression being unsheathed gracious god the great and the noble in persia glory in acts of such savagery that one is lost in amazement at the tales thereof day and night this wronged one yieldeth thanks and praise unto the lord of men for it is witnessed that the words of counsel and exhortation we uttered have proved effective and that this people hath evinced such character and conduct as are acceptable in our sight this is affirmed by virtue of the event which hath truly cheered the eye of the world and is none other than the intercession of the friends with the high authorities in favor of their enemies indeed one’s righteous deeds testify to the truth of one’s words we cherish the hope that men of piety may illumine the world through the radiant light of their conduct and we entreat the almighty—glorified and exalted is he—to grant that everyone may in this day remain steadfast in his love and stand firm in his cause he is in truth the protector of those who are wholly devoted to him and observe his precepts people of god countless are the realms which our pen of glory hath revealed and manifold the eyes to which it hath imparted true enlightenment yet most of the people in persia continue to be deprived of the benefits of profitable counsels and remain sorely lacking in useful sciences and arts formerly these sublime words were especially revealed by the pen of glory in honor of one of the faithful that perchance those that have gone astray may embrace the truth and become acquainted with the subtleties of the law of god the unbelievers and the faithless have set their minds on four things first the shedding of blood second the burning of books third the shunning of the followers of other religions fourth the extermination of other communities and groups now however through the strengthening grace and potency of the word of god these four barriers have been demolished these clear injunctions have been obliterated from the tablet and brutal dispositions have been transmuted into spiritual attributes exalted is his purpose glorified is his power magnified is his dominion now let us beseech god—praised be his glory—to graciously guide aright the followers of theshí‘ih sect and to purge them of unseemly conduct from the lips of the members of this sect foul imprecations fall unceasingly while they invoke the word “mal‘ún” accursed —uttered with guttural sound of the letter ‘ayn—as their daily relish god my god thou hearest the sighing of him who is thy light bahá hearkenest unto his lamentations in the daytime and in the night season and knowest that he desireth naught for himself but rather seeketh to sanctify the souls of thy servants and to deliver them from the fire with which they are beset at all times lord the hands of thy well favored servants are raised towards the heaven of thy bounty and those of thy sincere lovers are lifted up to the sublime heights of thy generosity disappoint them not entreat thee in that which they seek from the ocean of thy favor and from the heaven of thy grace and the daystar of thy bounty aid them lord to acquire such virtues as will exalt their stations among the peoples of the world verily thou art the powerful the mighty the most generous people of god give ear unto that which if heeded will ensure the freedom well being tranquility exaltation and advancement of all men certain laws and principles are necessary and indispensable for persia however it is fitting that these measures should be adopted in conformity with the considered views of his majesty—may god aid him through his grace—and of the learned divines and of the high ranking rulers subject to their approval place should be fixed where they would meet there they should hold fast to the cord of consultation and adopt and enforce that which is conducive to the security prosperity wealth and tranquility of the people for were any measure other than this to be adopted it could not but result in chaos and commotion according to the fundamental laws which we have formerly revealed in the kitáb aqdas and other tablets all affairs are committed to the care of just kings and presidents and of the trustees of the house of justice having pondered on that which we have enunciated every man of equity and discernment will readily perceive with his inner and outer eyes the splendors of the daystar of justice which radiate therefrom the system of government which the british people have adopted in london appeareth to be good for it is adorned with the light of both kingship and of the consultation of the people in formulating the principles and laws part hath been devoted to penalties which form an effective instrument for the security and protection of men however dread of the penalties maketh people desist only outwardly from committing vile and contemptible deeds while that which guardeth and restraineth man both outwardly and inwardly hath been and still is the fear of god it is man’s true protector and his spiritual guardian it behooveth him to cleave tenaciously unto that which will lead to the appearance of this supreme bounty well is it with him who giveth ear unto whatsoever my pen of glory hath proclaimed and observeth that whereunto he is bidden by the ordainer the ancient of days incline your hearts people of god unto the counsels of your true your incomparable friend the word of god may be likened unto sapling whose roots have been implanted in the hearts of men it is incumbent upon you to foster its growth through the living waters of wisdom of sanctified and holy words so that its root may become firmly fixed and its branches may spread out as high as the heavens and beyond ye that dwell on earth the distinguishing feature that marketh the preeminent character of this supreme revelation consisteth in that we have on the one hand blotted out from the pages of god’s holy book whatsoever hath been the cause of strife of malice and mischief amongst the children of men and have on the other laid down the essential prerequisites of concord of understanding of complete and enduring unity well is it with them that keep my statutes time and again have we admonished our beloved ones to avoid nay to flee from anything whatsoever from which the odor of mischief can be detected the world is in great turmoil and the minds of its people are in state of utter confusion we entreat the almighty that he may graciously illuminate them with the glory of his justice and enable them to discover that which will be profitable unto them at all times and under all conditions he verily is the all possessing the most high we have ere this uttered these sublime words let them that bear allegiance to this wronged one be even as raining cloud in moments of charity and benevolence and as blazing fire in restraining their base and appetitive natures gracious god thing hath recently happened which caused great astonishment it is reported that certain person went to the seat of the imperial throne in persia and succeeded in winning the good graces of some of the nobility by his ingratiating behavior how pitiful indeed how deplorable one wondereth why those who have been the symbols of highest glory should now stoop to boundless shame what is become of their high resolve whither is gone the sense of dignity and honor the sun of glory and wisdom hath unceasingly been shining above the horizon of persia but nowadays it hath sunk to such low level that certain dignitaries have allowed themselves to be treated as playthings in the hands of the foolish the aforesaid person hath written such things concerning this people in the egyptian press and in the beirut encyclopedia that the well informed and the learned were astonished he proceeded then to paris where he published newspaper entitled‘urvatu’l vuthqá the sure handle and sent copies thereof to all parts of the world he also sent copy to the prison of ‘akká and by so doing he meant to show affection and to make amends for his past actions in short this wronged one hath observed silence in regard to him we entreat god the true one to protect him and to shed upon him the light of justice and fairness it behooveth him to say god my god thou seest me standing before the door of thy forgiveness and benevolence turning my gaze toward the horizon of thy bountiful favors and manifold blessings beg of

lord of grace abounding the ordainer the all wise no god is there but thee the most powerful the all compelling the omnipotent people of god in this day everyone should fix his eyes upon the horizon of these blessed words “alone and unaided he doeth whatsoever he pleaseth whoso attaineth this station hath verily attained the light of the essential unity of god and is enlightened thereby while all others are reckoned in the book of god among the followers of idle fancy and vain imagination incline your ears to the voice of this wronged one and safeguard the integrity of your stations it is highly necessary and imperative that everyone should observe this matter unveiled and unconcealed this wronged one hath at all times proclaimed before the face of all the peoples of the world that which will serve as the key for unlocking the doors of sciences of arts of knowledge of well being of prosperity and wealth neither have the wrongs inflicted by the oppressors succeeded in silencing the shrill voice of the most exalted pen nor have the doubts of the perverse or of the seditious been able to hinder him from revealing the most sublime word earnestly beseech god that he may protect and purge the people of bahá from the idle fancies and corrupt imaginings of the followers of the former faith people of god righteous men of learning who dedicate themselves to the guidance of others and are freed and well guarded from the promptings of base and covetous nature are in the sight of him who is the desire of the world stars of the heaven of true knowledge it is essential to treat them with deference they are indeed fountains of soft flowing water stars that shine resplendent fruits of the blessed tree exponents of celestial power and oceans of heavenly wisdom happy is he that followeth them verily such soul is numbered in the book of god the lord of the mighty throne among those with whom it shall be well the glory which proceedeth from god the lord of the throne on high and of the earth below rest upon you people of bahá ye the companions of the crimson ark and upon such as have inclined their ears to your sweet voices and have observed that whereunto they are bidden in this mighty and wondrous tablet this is the epistle of god the help in peril the self subsisting he is god exalted is he the lord of wisdom and utterance praisebe unto god incomparable in majesty power and beauty peerless in glory might and grandeur too high is he for human imaginations to comprehend him or for any peer or equal to be ascribed unto him he hath clearly set forth his straight path in words and utterances of highest eloquence verily he is the all possessing the most exalted when he purposed to call the new creation into being he sent forth the manifest and luminous point from the horizon of his will it passed through every sign and manifested itself in every form until it reached the zenith as bidden by god the lord of all men this point is the focal center of the circle of names and marketh the culmination of the manifestations of letters in the world of creation through it have appeared indications of the impenetrable mystery the adorned symbol he who standeth revealed in the most great name—a name which is recorded in the luminous tablet and is inscribed in the holy the blessed the snow white scroll and when the point was joined to the second letter which appeareth in the beginning of the mathání it traversed the heavens of exposition and utterance then the eternal light of god shed its radiance flared up in the midmost heart of the firmament of testimony and produced two luminaries glorified be the merciful one unto whom no allusion can be made whom no expression can define nor any assertion reveal nor any evidence describe he is in truth the ordainer the all bountiful both in the beginning and in the end and he provided for them protectors and defenders from among the hosts of power and might verily he is the help in peril the mighty the unconstrained the preamble of this epistle is being revealed twice even as was the mathání praise be unto god who hath manifested the point hath unfolded therefrom the knowledge of all things whether of the past or of the future—a point he hath chosen to be the herald of his name and the harbinger of his great revelation which hath caused the limbs of all mankind to quake and the splendor of his light to shine forth above the horizon of the world verily this is the point which god hath ordained to be an ocean of light for the sincere among his servants and flame of fire to the froward amidst his creatures and the impious among his people—they who bartered away the gift of god for unbelief and the celestial food for hypocrisy and led their associates to wretched abode these are the people who have manifested sedition throughout the world and have violated his covenant on the day when the immortal being mounted his throne and the crier raised his voice from the haven of security and peace in the holy vale followers of the bayán fear ye the all merciful this is the one who hath been glorified by muḥammad the apostle of god and before him by the spirit and yet before him by the one who discoursed with god this is the point of the bayán calling aloud before the throne saying “by the righteousness of god ye have been created to glorify this most great announcement this perfect way which lay hid within the souls of the prophets which was treasured in the hearts of the chosen ones of god and was written down by the glorious pen of your lord the possessor of names say die in your wrath malicious ones verily he whose knowledge nothing escapeth hath appeared he who hath caused the countenance of divine knowledge to be wreathed in smiles is come through him the kingdom of utterance is embellished every receptive soul hath set his face towards the lord of revelations everyone resting on his knees hath stood up and every indolent one hath rushed forth to attain the sinai of assurance this is the day that god hath ordained to be blessing unto the righteous retribution for the wicked bounty for the faithful and fury of his wrath for the faithless and the froward verily he hath been made manifest invested by god with invincible sovereignty he hath revealed that wherewith naught on the earth or in the heavens can compare fear ye the all merciful people of the bayán and commit not that which the followers of the qur’án have committed—they who in the daytime and in the night season professed belief in the faith of god yet when the lord of all men did appear turned aside from him and pronounced so cruel sentence against him that on the day of return the mother book sorely bewailed his plight call ye to mind and ponder upon their deeds and words their stations and merits and the things they brought to pass when he who conversed on sinai unloosed his tongue when there was blast on the trumpet whereupon all that are in heaven and on earth swooned away except such as are reckoned among the letters of affirmation people of the bayán abandon your idle fancies and vain imaginings then with the eye of fairness look at the dayspring of his revelation and consider the things he hath manifested the words he hath divinely revealed and the sufferings that have befallen him at the hands of his enemies he is the one who hath willingly accepted every manner of tribulation for the proclamation of his cause and the exaltation of his word at one time he suffered imprisonment in the land of tá ṭihrán at another in the land of mím mázindarán then once again in the former land for the sake of the cause of god the maker of the heavens in his love for the cause of god the almighty the all bountiful he was subjected there to chains and fetters people of the bayán have ye forgotten my exhortations which my pen hath revealed and my tongue hath uttered have ye bartered away my certitude in exchange for your idle fancies and my way for your selfish desires have ye cast away the precepts of god and his remembrance and have ye forsaken his laws and ordinances fear ye god and abandon vain imaginings to the begetters thereof and leave superstitions to the devisers thereof and misgivings to the breeders thereof advance ye then with radiant faces and stainless hearts towards the horizon above which the daystar of certitude shineth resplendent at the bidding of god the lord of revelations praise be unto god who hath made the most great infallibility the shield for the temple of his cause in the realm of creation and hath assigned unto no one share of this lofty and sublime station—a station which is vesture which the fingers of transcendent power have woven for his august self it befitteth no one except him who is seated upon the mighty throne of “he doeth what he pleaseth whoso accepteth and recognizeth that which is written down at this moment by the pen of glory is indeed reckoned in the book of god the lord of the beginning and the end among the exponents of divine unity they that uphold the concept of the oneness of god when the stream of words reached this stage the sweet savors of true knowledge were shed abroad and the daystar of divine unity shone forth above the horizon of his holy utterance blessed is he whom his call hath attracted to the summit of glory who hath drawn nigh to the ultimate purpose and who hath recognized through the shrill voice of my pen of glory that which the lord of this world and of the next hath willed whoso faileth to quaff the choice wine which we have unsealed through the potency of our name the all compelling shall be unable to discern the splendors of the light of divine unity or to grasp the essential purpose underlying the scriptures of god the lord of heaven and earth the sovereign ruler of this world and of the world to come such man shall be accounted among the faithless in the book of god the all knowing the all informed thou honored inquirer we bear witness that thou didst firmly adhere unto seemly patience during the days when the pen was held back from movement and the tongue hesitated to set forth an explanation regarding the wondrous sign the most great infallibility thou hast asked this wronged one to remove for thee its veils and coverings to elucidate its mystery and character its state and position its excellence sublimity and exaltation by the life of god were we to unveil the pearls of testimony which lie hid within the shells of the ocean of knowledge and assurance or to let the beauties of divine mystery which are hidden within the chambers of utterance in the paradise of true understanding step out of their habitation then from every direction violent commotion would arise among the leaders of religion and thou wouldst witness the people of god held fast in the teeth of such wolves as have denied god both in the beginning and in the end therefore we restrained the pen for considerable lapse of time in accordance with divine wisdom and for the sake of protecting the faithful from those who have bartered away heavenly blessings for disbelief and have chosen for their people the abode of perdition thou seeker who art gifted with keen insight swear by him who attracted the concourse on high through the potency of his most sublime word verily the birds abiding within the domains of my kingdom and the doves dwelling in the rose garden of my wisdom utter such melodies and warblings as are inscrutable to all but god the lord of the kingdoms of earth and heaven and were these melodies to be revealed even to an extent smaller than needle’s eye the people of tyranny would utter such calumnies as none among former generations hath ever uttered and would commit such deeds as no one in past ages and centuries hath ever committed they have rejected the bounty of god and his proofs and have repudiated the testimony of god and his signs they have gone astray and have caused the people to go astray yet perceive it not they worship vain imaginings but know it not they have taken idle fancies for their lords and have neglected god yet understand not they have abandoned the most great ocean and are hastening towards the pool but comprehend not they follow their own idle fancies while turning aside from god the help in peril the self subsisting say by the righteousness of god the all merciful is come invested with power and sovereignty through his power the foundations of religions have quaked and the nightingale of utterance hath warbled its melody upon the highest branch of true understanding verily he who was hidden in the knowledge of god and is mentioned in the holy scriptures hath appeared say this is the day when the speaker on sinai hath mounted the throne of revelation and the people have stood before the lord of the worlds this is the day wherein the earth hath told out her tidings and hath laid bare her treasures when the oceans have brought forth their pearls and the divine lote tree its fruit when the sun hath shed its radiance and the moons have diffused their lights and the heavens have revealed their stars and the hour its signs and the resurrection its dreadful majesty when the pens have unloosed their outpourings and the spirits have laid bare their mysteries blessed is the man who recognizeth him and attaineth his presence and woe betide such as deny him and turn aside from him beseech god to aid his servants to return unto him verily he is the pardoner the forgiving the merciful thou who hast set thy face towards the realm on high and hast quaffed my sealed wine from the hand of bounteousness know thou that the term “infallibility” hath numerous meanings and divers stations in one sense it is applicable to the one whom god hath made immune from error similarly it is applied to every soul whom god hath guarded against sin transgression rebellion impiety disbelief and the like however the most great infallibility is confined to the one whose station is immeasurably exalted beyond ordinances or prohibitions and is sanctified from errors and omissions indeed he is light which is not followed by darkness and truth not overtaken by error were he to pronounce water to be wine or heaven to be earth or light to be fire he speaketh the truth and no doubt would there be about it and unto no one is given the right to question his authority or to say why or wherefore whosoever raiseth objections will be numbered with the froward in the book of god the lord of the worlds “verily he shall not be asked of his doings but all others shall be asked of their doings he is come from the invisible heaven bearing the banner “he doeth whatsoever he willeth” and is accompanied by hosts of power and authority while it is the duty of all besides him to strictly observe whatever laws and ordinances have been enjoined upon them and should anyone deviate therefrom even to the extent of hair’s breadth his work would be brought to naught consider thou and call to mind the time when muḥammad appeared he said and his word is the truth “pilgrimage to the house is service due to god and likewise are the daily prayer fasting and the laws which shone forth above the horizon of the book of god the lord of the world and the true educator of the peoples and kindreds of the earth it is incumbent upon everyone to obey him in whatsoever god hath ordained and whosoever denieth him hath disbelieved in god in his verses in his messengers and in his books were he to pronounce right to be wrong or denial to be belief he speaketh the truth as bidden by god this is station wherein sins or trespasses neither exist nor are mentioned consider thou the blessed the divinely revealed verse in which pilgrimage to the house is enjoined upon everyone it devolved upon those invested with authority after him to observe whatever had been prescribed unto them in the book unto no one is given the right to deviate from the laws and ordinances of god whoso deviateth therefrom is reckoned with the trespassers in the book of god the lord of the mighty throne thou who hast fixed thy gaze upon the dawning place of the cause of god know thou for certainty that the will of god is not limited by the standards of the people and god doth not tread in their ways rather is it incumbent upon everyone to firmly adhere to god’s straight path were he to pronounce the right to be the left or the south to be the north he speaketh the truth and there is no doubt of it verily he is to be praised in his acts and to be obeyed in his behests he hath no associate in his judgment nor any helper in his sovereignty he doeth whatsoever he willeth and ordaineth whatsoever he pleaseth know thou moreover that all else besides him have been created through the potency of word from his presence while of themselves they have no motion nor stillness except at his bidding and by his leave thou who soarest in the atmosphere of love and fellowship and hast fixed thy gaze upon the light of the countenance of thy lord the king of creation render thanks unto god inasmuch as he hath unraveled for thee that which was hidden and enshrined in his knowledge so that everyone may become aware that within his realm of supreme infallibility he hath not taken partner nor counselor unto himself he is in truth the dayspring of divine precepts and commandments and the fountainhead of knowledge and wisdom while all else besides him are but his subjects and under his rule and he is the supreme ruler the ordainer the all knowing the all informed as to thyself whenever thou art enraptured by the vitalizing breaths of the revealed verses and art carried away by the pure life giving water proffered by the hand of the bounty of thy lord the sovereign ruler of the day of resurrection lift up thy voice and say my god my god yield thee thanks that thou hast directed me towards thyself hast guided me unto thy horizon hast clearly set forth for me thy path hast revealed to me thy testimony and enabled me to set my face towards thee while most of the doctors and divines among thy servants together with such as follow them have without the least proof or evidence from thee turned away from thee blessing be unto thee lord of names and glory be unto thee creator of the heavens inasmuch as thou hast through the power of thy name the self subsisting given me to drink of thy sealed wine hast caused me to draw nigh unto thee and hast enabled me to recognize the dayspring of thine utterance the manifestation of thy signs the fountainhead of thy laws and commandments and the source of thy wisdom and bestowals blessed is the land that hath been ennobled by thy footsteps wherein the throne of thy sovereignty is established and the fragrance of thy raiment is diffused by thy glory and majesty by thy might and power desire not my sight save to behold thy beauty nor my hearing save to hearken to thy call and thy verses my god my god debar not the eyes from that for which thou hast created them nor the faces from turning to thy horizon or from paying homage at the portals of thy majesty or from appearing in the presence of thy throne or from bowing down before the splendors of the daystar of thy bounty am the one lord whose heart and soul whose limbs whose inner and outer tongue testify to thy unity and thy oneness and bear witness that thou art god and that there is no god but thee thou didst bring mankind into being to know thee and to serve thy cause that their station might thereby be elevated upon thine earth and their souls be uplifted by virtue of the things thou hast revealed in thy scriptures thy books and thy tablets yet no sooner didst thou manifest thyself and reveal thy signs than they turned away from thee and repudiated thee and rejected that which thou didst unveil before their eyes through the potency of thy might and thy power they rose up to inflict harm upon thee to extinguish thy light and to put out the flame that blazeth in thy burning bush their iniquity waxed so grievous that they conspired to shed thy blood and to violate thy honor and likewise acted he whom thou hadst nurtured with the hand of thy loving kindness hadst protected from the mischief of the rebellious among thy creatures and the froward amidst thy servants and whom thou hadst set the task of writing thy holy verses before thy throne alas alas for the things he perpetrated in thy days to such an extent that he violated thy covenant and thy testament rejected thy holy writ rose up in rebellion and committed that which caused the denizens of thy kingdom to lament then no sooner had he found his hopes shattered and had perceived the odor of utter failure than he raised his voice and gave tongue to that which caused thy chosen ones who are nigh unto thee and the inmates of the pavilion of glory to be lost in bewilderment thou seest me my god writhing in anguish upon the dust like unto fish deliver me have mercy upon me thou whose aid is invoked by all men thou within whose grasp lie the reins of power over all men and women whenever ponder my grievous shortcomings and my great trespasses despair assaileth me from every direction and whenever pause to meditate upon the ocean of thy bounteousness and the heaven of thy grace and the daystar of thy tender compassion inhale the fragrance of hope diffused from right and left from north and south as if every created thing imparteth unto me the joyous tidings that the clouds of the heaven of thy mercy will pour down their rain upon me by thy might thou who art the mainstay of the sincere ones and the desire of them that enjoy near access unto thee thy manifold favors and blessings and the revelations of thy grace and loving kindness have truly emboldened me how otherwise can utter nothingness magnify the name of him who hath by word brought creation into being and how can an evanescent creature extol him who hath demonstrated that no description can ever express him and no word of praise magnify his glory he hath from everlasting been immeasurably exalted above the understanding of his creatures and sanctified from the conceptions of his servants lord thou beholdest this lifeless one before thy face suffer him through thy generosity and bountiful favor not to be deprived of the chalice of immortal life and thou seest this afflicted one standing before thy throne turn him not away from the ocean of thy healing entreat thee to enable me at all times and under all conditions to remember thee to magnify thy name and to serve thy cause though am well aware that whatever proceedeth from servant cannot transcend the limitations of his soul nor beseem thy lordship nor be worthy of the court of thy glory and thy majesty

unto thy friend through whom the daystar of revelation shone brightly above the horizon of ḥijáz and the dawning light of divine truth shed its radiance among all men proclaiming “the day when mankind shall stand before the lord of the worlds and before muḥammad thou didst impart this glad tiding unto him who conversed with thee saying “bring forth thy people from the darkness into the light and

flowing and its trees luxuriant and the sunlight playing in their midst turning our face to the right we beheld what the pen is powerless to describe nor can it set forth that which the eye of the lord of mankind witnessed in that most sanctified that most sublime that blest and most exalted spot turning then to the left we gazed on one of the beauties of the most sublime paradise standing on pillar of light and calling aloud saying “o inmates of earth and heaven behold ye my beauty and my radiance and my revelation and my effulgence by god the true one am trustworthiness and the revelation thereof and the beauty thereof will recompense whosoever will cleave unto me and recognize my rank and station and hold fast unto my hem am the most great ornament of the people of bahá and

moved to tears and to lamentation neither the adversities of the world nor the harm inflicted by its nations could deter him who is the king of eternity from voicing his summons or frustrate his purpose when those who had for years been hiding behind the veils perceived that the horizon of the cause was resplendent and that the word of god was all pervasive they rushed forth and with swords of malice inflicted such harm as no pen can portray nor any tongue describe they that judge with fairness testify that since the early days of the cause this wronged one hath arisen unveiled and resplendent before the faces of kings and commoners before the rulers and the divines and hath in ringing tones summoned all men unto the straight path he hath had no helper save his pen nor any succorer other than himself those who are ignorant or heedless of the motivating purpose of the cause of god have rebelled against him such men are the foreboders of evil whom god hath mentioned in his book and tablets and against whose influence clamor and deception he hath warned his people well is it with those who in the face of the remembrance of the lord of eternity regard the peoples of the world as utter nothingness as thing forgotten and hold fast to the firm handle of god in such wise that neither doubts nor insinuations nor swords nor cannon could hold them back or deprive them of his presence blessed are the steadfast blessed are they that stand firm in his faith in response to thy request the pen of glory hath graciously described the stations and grades of the most great infallibility the purpose is that all should know of certainty that the seal of the prophets —may the souls of all else but him be offered up for his sake—is without likeness peer or partner in his own station the holy ones —may the blessings of god be upon them—were created through the potency of his word and after him they were the most learned and the most distinguished among the people and abide in the utmost station of servitude the divine essence sanctified from every comparison and likeness is established in the prophet and god’s inmost reality exalted above any peer or partner is manifest in him this is the station of true unity and of veritable singleness the followers of the previous dispensation grievously failed to acquire an adequate understanding of this station the primal point —may the life of all else but him be offered up for his sake—saith “if the seal of the prophets had not uttered the word ‘successorship such station would not have been created the people aforetime joined partners with god though they professed belief in his unity and although they were the most ignorant amongst men they considered themselves the most accomplished but as token of divine retribution upon those heedless ones their erroneous beliefs and pursuits have in this day of judgment been made clear and evident to every man of discernment and understanding beseech thou god the true one that he may graciously shield the followers of this revelation from the idle fancies and corrupt imaginings of such as belong to the former faith and may not deprive them of the effulgent splendors of the daystar of true unity jalíl he whom the world hath wronged now proclaimeth the light of justice is dimmed and the sun of equity veiled from sight the robber occupieth the seat of the protector and guard and the position of the faithful is seized by the traitor year ago an oppressor ruled over this city and at every instant caused fresh harm by the righteousness of the lord he wrought that which cast terror into the hearts of men but to the pen of glory the tyranny of the world hath never been nor will it ever be hindrance in the abundance of our grace and loving kindness we have revealed specially for the rulers and ministers of the world that which is conducive to safety and protection tranquility and peace haply the children of men may rest secure from the evils of oppression he verily is the protector the helper the giver of victory it is incumbent upon the men of god’s house of justice to fix their gaze by day and by night upon that which hath shone forth from the pen of glory for the training of peoples the upbuilding of nations the protection of man and the safeguarding of his honor the first ishráq when the daystar of wisdom rose above the horizon of god’s holy dispensation it voiced this all glorious utterance they that are possessed of wealth and invested with authority and power must show the profoundest regard for religion in truth religion is radiant light and an impregnable stronghold for the protection and welfare of the peoples of the world for the fear of god impelleth man to hold fast to that which is good and shun all evil should the lamp of religion be obscured chaos and confusion will ensue and the lights of fairness and justice of tranquility and peace cease to shine unto this will bear witness every man of true understanding the second ishráq we have enjoined upon all mankind to establish the most great peace—the surest of all means for the protection of humanity the sovereigns of the world should with one accord hold fast thereunto for this is the supreme instrument that can ensure the security and welfare of all peoples and nations they verily are the manifestations of the power of god and the daysprings of his authority we beseech the almighty that he may graciously assist them in that which is conducive to the well being of their subjects full explanation regarding this matter hath been previously set forth by the pen of glory well is it with them that act accordingly the third ishráq it is incumbent upon everyone to observe god’s holy commandments inasmuch as they are the wellspring of life unto the world the heaven of divine wisdom is illumined with the two luminaries of consultation and compassion and the canopy of world order is upraised upon the two pillars of reward and punishment the fourth ishráq in this revelation the hosts that can render it victorious are the hosts of praiseworthy deeds and upright character the leader and commander of these hosts hath ever been the fear of god fear that encompasseth all things and reigneth over all things the fifth ishráq governments should fully acquaint themselves with the conditions of those they govern and confer upon them positions according to desert and merit it is enjoined upon every ruler and sovereign to consider this matter with the utmost care that the traitor may not usurp the position of the faithful nor the despoiler rule in the place of the trustworthy among the officials who in the past have governed in this most great prison some praise be to god were adorned with justice but as to others we take refuge with god we beseech the one true god to guide them one and all that haply they may not be deprived of the fruit of faith and trustworthiness nor be withheld from the light of equity and justice the sixth ishráqis union and concord amongst the children of men from the beginning of time the light of unity hath shed its divine radiance upon the world and the greatest means for the promotion of that unity is for the peoples of the world to understand one another’s writing and speech in former epistles we have enjoined upon the trustees of the house of justice either to choose one language from among those now existing or to adopt new one and in like manner to select common script both of which should be taught in all the schools of the world thus will the earth be regarded as one country and one home the most glorious fruit of the tree of knowledge is this exalted word of one tree are all ye the fruit and of one bough the leaves let not man glory in this that he loveth his country let him rather glory in this that he loveth his kind concerning this we have previously revealed that which is the means of the reconstruction of the world and the unity of nations blessed are they that attain thereunto blessed are they that act accordingly the seventh ishráq the pen of glory counseleth everyone regarding the instruction and education of children behold that which the will of god hath revealed upon our arrival in the prison city and recorded in the most holy book unto every father hath been enjoined the instruction of his son and daughter in the art of reading and writing and in all that hath been laid down in the holy tablet he that putteth away that which is commanded unto him the trustees are then to take from him that which is required for their instruction if he be wealthy and if not the matter devolveth upon the house of justice verily have we made it shelter for the poor and needy he that bringeth up his son or the son of another it is as though he hath brought up son of mine upon him rest my glory my loving kindness my mercy that have compassed the world the eighth ishráq this passage now written by the pen of glory is accounted as part of the most holy book the men of god’s house of justice have been charged with the affairs of the people they in truth are the trustees of god among his servants and the daysprings of authority in his countries people of god that which traineth the world is justice for it is upheld by two pillars reward and punishment these two pillars are the sources of life to the world inasmuch as for each day there is new problem and for every problem an expedient solution such affairs should be referred to the house of justice that the members thereof may act according to the needs and requirements of the time they that for the sake of god arise to serve his cause are the recipients of divine inspiration from the unseen kingdom it is incumbent upon all to be obedient unto them all matters of state should be referred to the house of justice but acts of worship must be observed according to that which god hath revealed in his book people of bahá ye are the dawning places of the love of god and the daysprings of his loving kindness defile not your tongues with the cursing and reviling of any soul and guard your eyes against that which is not seemly set forth that which ye possess if it be favorably received your end is attained if not to protest is vain leave that soul to himself and turn unto the lord the protector the self subsisting be not the cause of grief much less of discord and strife the hope is cherished that ye may obtain true education in the shelter of the tree of his tender mercies and act in accordance with that which god desireth ye are all the leaves of one tree and the drops of one ocean the ninth ishráq the purpose of religion as revealed from the heaven of god’s holy will is to establish unity and concord amongst the peoples of the world make it not the cause of dissension and strife the religion of god and his divine law are the most potent instruments and the surest of all means for the dawning of the light of unity amongst men the progress of the world the development of nations the tranquility of peoples and the peace of all who dwell on earth are among the principles and ordinances of god religion bestoweth upon man the most precious of all gifts offereth the cup of prosperity imparteth eternal life and showereth imperishable benefits upon mankind it behooveth the chiefs and rulers of the world and in particular the trustees of god’s house of justice to endeavor to the utmost of their power to safeguard its position promote its interests and exalt its station in the eyes of the world in like manner it is incumbent upon them to inquire into the conditions of their subjects and to acquaint themselves with the affairs and activities of the divers communities in their dominions we call upon the manifestations of the power of god—the sovereigns and rulers on earth—to bestir themselves and do all in their power that haply they may banish discord from this world and illumine it with the light of concord it is incumbent upon everyone to firmly adhere to and observe that which hath streamed forth from our most exalted pen god the true one beareth me witness and every atom in existence is moved to testify that such means as lead to the elevation the advancement the education the protection and the regeneration of the peoples of the earth have been clearly set forth by us and are revealed in the holy books and tablets by the pen of glory we entreat god to graciously aid his servants what this wronged one doth expect from everyone is justice and fairness let no one be content with mere hearing rather doth it behoove everyone to ponder that which this wronged one hath revealed swear by the daystar of utterance shining above the horizon of the kingdom of the all merciful had there been any expounder or speaker discernible we would not have made ourself the object of the censure ridicule and slander of the people upon our arrival in ‘iráq we found the cause of god sunk in deep apathy and the breeze of divine revelation stilled most of the believers were faint and dispirited nay utterly lost and dead hence there was second blast on the trumpet whereupon the tongue of grandeur uttered these blessed words “we have sounded the trumpet for the second time thus the whole world was quickened through the vitalizing breaths of divine revelation and inspiration certain souls have now sallied forth from behind the veils intent on inflicting harm upon this wronged one they have hindered and denied the outpouring of this priceless bounty ye that judge with fairness if this cause is to be denied then what other cause in this world can be vindicated or deemed worthy of acceptance such as have turned away from the cause of god are diligently seeking to collect the holy writings of this revelation and they have already through gestures of friendship managed to secure certain of these writings from those who held them in their possession moreover when they meet the followers of any religion they hold themselves out as believers therein say die ye in your wrath verily he hath appeared with so great an authority that no man of vision of hearing of insight of justice or of equity can ever deny him unto this beareth witness in this resplendent hour the pen of him who is the ancient of days jalíl upon thee be my glory we exhort the loved ones of god to perform good deeds that perchance they may be graciously assisted and may hold fast to that which hath been sent down from the heaven of his revelation the benefits arising from this divine utterance shall fall upon such as observe his precepts we beseech god to enable them to do that which is pleasing and acceptable unto him to grant that they may deal equitably and may observe justice in this all compelling cause to acquaint them with his holy writings and to direct their steps towards his straight path our exalted herald—may the life of all else besides him be offered up for his sake—hath revealed certain laws however in the realm of his revelation these laws were made subject to our sanction hence this wronged one hath put some of them into effect by embodying them in the kitáb aqdas in different words others we set aside he holdeth in his hand the authority he doeth what he willeth and he ordaineth whatsoever he pleaseth he is the almighty the all praised there are also ordinances newly revealed blessed are they that attain blessed are they that observe his precepts the people of god should make the utmost endeavor that perchance the fire of hatred and malice which smoldereth in the breasts of kindreds and peoples may through the living waters of utterance and the exhortations of him who is the desire of the world be quenched and the trees of human existence may be adorned with wondrous and excellent fruit he is in truth the admonisher the compassionate the all bountiful may the brightness of his glory shining above the horizon of bounty rest upon you people of bahá upon every one who standeth firm and steadfast and upon those that are well grounded in the faith and are endued with true understanding as to thy question concerning interest and profit on gold and silver some years ago the following passage was revealed from the heaven of the all merciful in honor of the one who beareth the name of god entitled zaynu’l muqarrabín —upon him be the glory of the most glorious he—exalted be his word—saith many people stand in need of this because if there were no prospect for gaining interest the affairs of men would suffer collapse or dislocation one can seldom find person who would manifest such consideration towards his fellow man his countryman or towards his own brother and would show such tender solicitude for him as to be well disposed to grant him loan on benevolent terms therefore as token of favor towards men we have prescribed that interest on money should be treated like other business transactions that are current amongst men thus now that this lucid commandment hath descended from the heaven of the will of god it is lawful and proper to charge interest on money that the people of the world may in spirit of amity and fellowship and with joy and gladness devotedly engage themselves in magnifying the name of him who is the well beloved of all mankind verily he ordaineth according to his own choosing he hath now made interest on money lawful even as he had made it unlawful in the past within his grasp he holdeth the kingdom of authority he doeth and ordaineth he is in truth the ordainer the all knowing render thou thanks unto thy lord zaynu’l muqarrabín for this manifest bounty many ecclesiastics in persia have through innumerable designs and devices been feeding on illicit gains obtained by usury they have contrived ways to give its outward form fair semblance of lawfulness they make plaything of the laws and ordinances of god but they understand not however this is matter that should be practiced with moderation and fairness our pen of glory hath as token of wisdom and for the convenience of the people desisted from laying down its limit nevertheless we exhort the loved ones of god to observe justice and fairness and to do that which would prompt the friends of god to evince tender mercy and compassion towards each other he is in truth the counselor the compassionate the all bountiful god grant that all men may be graciously aided to observe that which the tongue of the one true god hath uttered and if they put into practice what we have set forth god—exalted be his glory—will assuredly double their portion through the heaven of his bounty verily he is the generous the forgiving the compassionate praise be unto god the most exalted the most great nevertheless the conduct of these affairs hath been entrusted to the men of the house of justice that they may enforce them according to the exigencies of the time and the dictates of wisdom once again we exhort all believers to observe justice and fairness and to show forth love and contentment they are indeed the people of bahá the companions of the crimson ark upon them be the peace of god the lord of all names the creator of the heavens this tablet was addressed to áqá muḥammad distinguished believer from the town of qá’in who was surnamed nabíl akbar seememorials of the faithful chapter “nabil akbar” another distinguished believer of qá’in mullá muḥammad ‘alí was known as nabíl qá’iní seememorials of the faithful chapter “nabil of qa in” in the abjad notation the name “muḥammad” has the same numerical value as “nabíl thisis an epistle which the all merciful hath sent down from the kingdom of utterance it is truly breath of life unto those who dwell in the realm of creation glorified be the lord of all worlds in this epistle mention is made of him who magnifieth the name of god his lord and who is named nabíl in weighty tablet muḥammad hearken unto the voice proceeding out of the realm of glory calling aloud from the celestial tree which hath risen above the land of za‘farán verily no god is there but me the omniscient the wise be thou as the breezes of the all merciful for the trees of the realm of existence and foster their growth through the potency of the name of thy lord the just the all informed we desire to acquaint thee with that which will serve as reminder unto the people that they may put away the things current amongst them and set their faces towards god the lord of the sincere we exhort mankind in these days when the countenance of justice is soiled with dust when the flames of unbelief are burning high and the robe of wisdom rent asunder when tranquility and faithfulness have ebbed away and trials and tribulations have waxed severe when covenants are broken and ties are severed when no man knoweth how to discern light and darkness or to distinguish guidance from error peoples of the world forsake all evil hold fast that which is good strive to be shining examples unto all mankind and true reminders of the virtues of god amidst men he that riseth to serve my cause should manifest my wisdom and bend every effort to banish ignorance from the earth be united in counsel be one in thought let each morn be better than its eve and each morrow richer than its yesterday man’s merit lieth in service and virtue and not in the pageantry of wealth and riches take heed that your words be purged from idle fancies and worldly desires and your deeds be cleansed from craftiness and suspicion dissipate not the wealth of your precious lives in the pursuit of evil and corrupt affection nor let your endeavors be spent in promoting your personal interest be generous in your days of plenty and be patient in the hour of loss adversity is followed by success and rejoicings follow woe guard against idleness and sloth and cling unto that which profiteth mankind whether young or old whether high or low beware lest ye sow tares of dissension among men or plant thorns of doubt in pure and radiant hearts ye beloved of the lord commit not that which defileth the limpid stream of love or destroyeth the sweet fragrance of friendship by the righteousness of the lord ye were created to show love one to another and not perversity and rancor take pride not in love for yourselves but in love for your fellow creatures glory not in love for your country but in love for all mankind let your eye be chaste your hand faithful your tongue truthful and your heart enlightened abase not the station of the learned in bahá and belittle not the rank of such rulers as administer justice amidst you set your reliance on the army of justice put on the armor of wisdom let your adorning be forgiveness and mercy and that which cheereth the hearts of the well favored of god by my life thy grievances have plunged me into sorrow regard not the children of the world and all their doings but fix thy gaze upon god and his never ending dominion verily he calleth to thy remembrance that which is the source of delight for all mankind drink thou the life giving water of blissful joy from the chalice of utterance proffered by the fountainhead of divine revelation—he who hath made mention of thee in this mighty stronghold endeavor to the utmost of thy powers to establish the word of truth with eloquence and wisdom and to dispel falsehood from the face of the earth thus directeth thee the dayspring of divine knowledge from this luminous horizon thou who speakest in my name consider the people and the things they have wrought in my days we revealed unto one of the rulers that which overpowereth all the dwellers of the earth and requested him to bring us face to face with the learned men of this age that we might set forth for him the testimony of god his proofs his glory and his majesty and naught did we intend thereby but the highest good however he committed that which hath caused the inmates of the cities of justice and equity to lament thus hath judgment been given between me and him verily thy lord is the ordainer the all informed in such circumstances as thou seest how can the celestial bird soar into the atmosphere of divine mysteries when its wings have been battered with the stones of idle fancy and bitter hatred and it is cast into prison built of unyielding stone by the righteousness of god the people have perpetrated grievous injustice as regards thine assertions about the beginning of creation this is matter on which conceptions vary by reason of the divergences in men’s thoughts and opinions wert thou to assert that it hath ever existed and shall continue to exist it would be true or wert thou to affirm the same concept as is mentioned in the sacred scriptures no doubt would there be about it for it hath been revealed by god the lord of the worlds indeed he was hidden treasure this is station that can never be described nor even alluded to and in the station of “i did wish to make myself known god was and his creation had ever existed beneath his shelter from the beginning that hath no beginning apart from its being preceded by firstness which cannot be regarded as firstness and originated by cause inscrutable even unto all men of learning that which hath been in existence had existed before but not in the form thou seest today the world of existence came into being through the heat generated from the interaction between the active force and that which is its recipient these two are the same yet they are different thus doth the great announcement inform thee about this glorious structure such as communicate the generating influence and such as receive its impact are indeed created through the irresistible word of god which is the cause of the entire creation while all else besides his word are but the creatures and the effects thereof verily thy lord is the expounder the all wise know thou moreover that the word of god—exalted be his glory—is higher and far superior to that which the senses can perceive for it is sanctified from any property or substance it transcendeth the limitations of known elements and is exalted above all the essential and recognized substances it became manifest without any syllable or sound and is none but the command of god which pervadeth all created things it hath never been withheld from the world of being it is god’s all pervasive grace from which all grace doth emanate it is an entity far removed above all that hath been and shall be we are loath to enlarge on this subject inasmuch as the unbelievers have inclined their ears towards us in order to hear that which might enable them to cavil against god the help in peril the self subsisting and since they are unable to attain to mysteries of knowledge and wisdom from what hath been unraveled by the source of divine splendor they rise in protest and burst into clamor but it is true to say that they object to that which they comprehend not to the expositions given by the expounder nor the truths imparted by the one true god the knower of things unseen their objections one and all turn upon themselves and swear by thy life that they are devoid of understanding every thing must needs have an origin and every building builder verily the word of god is the cause which hath preceded the contingent world—a world which is adorned with the splendors of the ancient of days yet is being renewed and regenerated at all times immeasurably exalted is the god of wisdom who hath raised this sublime structure look at the world and ponder while upon it it unveileth the book of its own self before thine eyes and revealeth that which the pen of thy lord the fashioner the all informed hath inscribed therein it will acquaint thee with that which is within it and upon it and will give thee such clear explanations as to make thee independent of every eloquent expounder say nature in its essence is the embodiment of my name the maker the creator its manifestations are diversified by varying causes and in this diversity there are signs for men of discernment nature is god’s will and is its expression in and through the contingent world it is dispensation of providence ordained by the ordainer the all wise were anyone to affirm that it is the will of god as manifested in the world of being no one should question this assertion it is endowed with power whose reality men of learning fail to grasp indeed man of insight can perceive naught therein save the effulgent splendor of our name the creator say this is an existence which knoweth no decay and nature itself is lost in bewilderment before its revelations its compelling evidences and its effulgent glory which have encompassed the universe it ill beseemeth thee to turn thy gaze unto former or more recent times make thou mention of this day and magnify that which hath appeared therein it will in truth suffice all mankind indeed expositions and discourses in explanation of such things cause the spirits to be chilled it behooveth thee to speak forth in such wise as to set the hearts of true believers ablaze and cause their bodies to soar whoso firmly believeth today in the rebirth of man and is fully conscious that god the most exalted wieldeth supreme ascendancy and absolute authority over this new creation verily such man is reckoned with them that are endued with insight in this most great revelation unto this beareth witness every discerning believer walk thou high above the world of being through the power of the most great name that thou mayest become aware of the immemorial mysteries and be acquainted with that wherewith no one is acquainted verily thy lord is the helper the all knowing the all informed be thou as throbbing artery pulsating in the body of the entire creation that through the heat generated by this motion there may appear that which will quicken the hearts of those who hesitate at the time when we were hidden behind countless veils of light thou didst commune with me and didst witness the luminaries of the heaven of my wisdom and the billows of the ocean of mine utterance verily thy lord is the truthful the faithful great indeed is the blessedness of him who hath attained the liberal effusions of this ocean in the days of his lord the most bountiful the all wise during our sojourn in ‘iráq when we were at the house of one named majíd we set forth clearly for thee the mysteries of creation and the origin the culmination and the cause thereof however since our departure we have limited ourself to this affirmation “verily no god is there but me the ever forgiving the bountiful teach thou the cause of god with an utterance which will cause the bushes to be enkindled and the call “verily there is no god but me the almighty the unconstrained” to be raised therefrom say human utterance is an essence which aspireth to exert its influence and needeth moderation as to its influence this is conditional upon refinement which in turn is dependent upon hearts which are detached and pure as to its moderation this hath to be combined with tact and wisdom as prescribed in the holy scriptures and tablets meditate upon that which hath streamed forth from the heaven of the will of thy lord he who is the source of all grace that thou mayest grasp the intended meaning which is enshrined in the sacred depths of the holy writings those who have rejected god and firmly cling to nature as it is in itself are verily bereft of knowledge and wisdom they are truly of them that are far astray they have failed to attain the lofty summit and have fallen short of the ultimate purpose therefore their eyes were shut and their thoughts differed while the leaders among them have believed in god and in his invincible sovereignty unto this beareth witness thy lord the help in peril the self subsisting when the eyes of the people of the east were captivated by the arts and wonders of the west they roved distraught in the wilderness of material causes oblivious of the one who is the causer of causes and the sustainer thereof while such men as were the source and the wellspring of wisdom never denied the moving impulse behind these causes nor the creator or the origin thereof thy lord knoweth yet most of the people know not now we have for the sake of god the lord of names set ourself the task of mentioning in this tablet some accounts of the sages that the eyes of the people may be opened thereby and that they may become fully assured that he is in truth the maker the omnipotent the creator the originator the all knowing the all wise although it is recognized that the contemporary men of learning are highly qualified in philosophy arts and crafts yet were anyone to observe with discriminating eye he would readily comprehend that most of this knowledge hath been acquired from the sages of the past for it is they who have laid the foundation of philosophy reared its structure and reinforced its pillars thus doth thy lord the ancient of days inform thee the sages aforetime acquired their knowledge from the prophets inasmuch as the latter were the exponents of divine philosophy and the revealers of heavenly mysteries men quaffed the crystal living waters of their utterance while others satisfied themselves with the dregs everyone receiveth portion according to his measure verily he is the equitable the wise empedocles who distinguished himself in philosophy was contemporary of david while pythagoras lived in the days of solomon son of david and acquired wisdom from the treasury of prophethood it is he who claimed to have heard the whispering sound of the heavens and to have attained the station of the angels in truth thy lord will clearly set forth all things if he pleaseth verily he is the wise the all pervading the essence and the fundamentals of philosophy have emanated from the prophets that the people differ concerning the inner meanings and mysteries thereof is to be attributed to the divergence of their views and minds we would fain recount to thee the following one of the prophets once was communicating to his people that with which the omnipotent lord had inspired him truly thy lord is the inspirer the gracious the exalted when the fountain of wisdom and eloquence gushed forth from the wellspring of his utterance and the wine of divine knowledge inebriated those who had sought his threshold he exclaimed “lo all are filled with the spirit from among the people there was he who held fast unto this statement and actuated by his own fancies conceived the idea that the spirit literally penetrateth or entereth into the body and through lengthy expositions he advanced proofs to vindicate this concept and groups of people followed in his footsteps to mention their names at this point or to give thee detailed account thereof would lead to prolixity and would depart from the main theme verily thy lord is the all wise the all knowing there was also he who partook of the choice wine whose seal had been removed by the key of the tongue of him who is the revealer of the verses of thy lord the gracious the most generous verily the philosophers have not denied the ancient of days most of them passed away deploring their failure to fathom his mystery even as some of them have testified verily thy lord is the adviser the all informed consider hippocrates the physician he was one of the eminent philosophers who believed in god and acknowledged his sovereignty after him came socrates who was indeed wise accomplished and righteous he practiced self denial repressed his appetites for selfish desires and turned away from material pleasures he withdrew to the mountains where he dwelt in cave he dissuaded men from worshipping idols and taught them the way of god the lord of mercy until the ignorant rose up against him they arrested him and put him to death in prison thus relateth to thee this swift moving pen what penetrating vision into philosophy this eminent man had he is the most distinguished of all philosophers and was highly versed in wisdom we testify that he is one of the heroes in this field and an outstanding champion dedicated unto it he had profound knowledge of such sciences as were current amongst men as well as of those which were veiled from their minds methinks he drank one draught when the most great ocean overflowed with gleaming and life giving waters he it is who perceived unique tempered and pervasive nature in things bearing the closest likeness to the human spirit and he discovered this nature to be distinct from the substance of things in their refined form he hath special pronouncement on this weighty theme wert thou to ask from the worldly wise of this generation about this exposition thou wouldst witness their incapacity to grasp it verily thy lord speaketh the truth but most people comprehend not after socrates came the divine plato who was pupil of the former and occupied the chair of philosophy as his successor he acknowledged his belief in god and in his signs which pervade all that hath been and shall be then came aristotle the well known man of knowledge he it is who discovered the power of gaseous matter these men who stand out as leaders of the people and are preeminent among them one and all acknowledged their belief in the immortal being who holdeth in his grasp the reins of all sciences will also mention for thee the invocation voiced by balínús who was familiar with the theories put forward by the father of philosophy regarding the mysteries of creation as given in his chrysolite tablets that everyone may be fully assured of the things we have elucidated for thee in this manifest tablet which if pressed with the hand of fairness and knowledge will yield the spirit of life for the quickening of all created things great is the blessedness of him who swimmeth in this ocean and celebrateth the praise of his lord the gracious the best beloved indeed the breezes of divine revelation are diffused from the verses of thy lord in such wise that no one can dispute its truth except those who are bereft of hearing of vision of understanding and of every human faculty verily thy lord beareth witness unto this yet the people understand not this man hath said “i am balínús the wise one the performer of wonders the producer of talismans he surpassed everyone else in the diffusion of arts and sciences and soared unto the loftiest heights of humility and supplication give ear unto that which he hath said entreating the all possessing the most exalted “i stand in the presence of my lord extolling his gifts and bounties and praising him with that wherewith he praiseth his own self that may become source of blessing and guidance unto such men as acknowledge my words and further he saith “o lord thou art god and no god is there but thee thou art the creator and no creator is there except thee assist me by thy grace and strengthen me my heart is seized with alarm my limbs tremble have lost my reason and my mind hath failed me bestow upon me strength and enable my tongue to speak forth with wisdom and still further he saith “thou art in truth the knowing the wise the powerful the compassionate it was this man of wisdom who became informed of the mysteries of creation and discerned the subtleties which lie enshrined in the hermetic writings we have no wish to mention anything further but we shall utter that which the spirit hath instilled into my heart in truth there is no god but him the knowing the mighty the help in peril the most excellent the all praised by my life in this day the celestial tree is loath to proclaim aught else to the world but this affirmation “verily there is none other god but me the peerless the all informed had it not been for the love cherish for thee would not have uttered single word of what hath been mentioned appreciate the value of this station and preserve it as thou wouldst thine eye and be of them that are truly thankful thou knowest full well that we perused not the books which men possess and we acquired not the learning current amongst them and yet whenever we desire to quote the sayings of the learned and of the wise presently there will appear before the face of thy lord in the form of tablet all that which hath appeared in the world and is revealed in the holy books and scriptures thus do we set down in writing that which the eye perceiveth verily his knowledge encompasseth the earth and the heavens this is tablet wherein the pen of the unseen hath inscribed the knowledge of all that hath been and shall be—a knowledge that none other but my wondrous tongue can interpret indeed my heart as it is in itself hath been purged by god from the concepts of the learned and is sanctified from the utterances of the wise in truth naught doth it mirror forth but the revelations of god unto this beareth witness the tongue of grandeur in this perspicuous book say people of the earth beware lest any reference to wisdom debar you from its source or withhold you from the dawning place thereof fix your hearts upon your lord the educator the all wise for every land we have prescribed portion for every occasion an allotted share for every pronouncement an appointed time and for every situation an apt remark consider greece we made it seat of wisdom for prolonged period however when the appointed hour struck its throne was subverted its tongue ceased to speak its light grew dim and its banner was hauled down thus do we bestow and withdraw verily thy lord is he who giveth and divesteth the mighty the powerful in every land we have set up luminary of knowledge and when the time foreordained is at hand it will shine resplendent above its horizon as decreed by god the all knowing the all wise if it be our will we are fully capable of describing for thee whatever existeth in every land or hath come to pass therein indeed the knowledge of thy lord pervadeth the heavens and the earth know thou moreover that the people aforetime have produced things which the contemporary men of knowledge have been unable to produce we recall unto thee múrṭus who was one of the learned he invented an apparatus which transmitted sound over distance of sixty miles others besides him have also discovered things which no one in this age hath beheld verily thy lord revealeth in every epoch whatsoever he pleaseth as token of wisdom on his part he is in truth the supreme ordainer the all wise true philosopher would never deny god nor his evidences rather would he acknowledge his glory and overpowering majesty which overshadow all created things verily we love those men of knowledge who have brought to light such things as promote the best interests of humanity and we aided them through the potency of our behest for well are we able to achieve our purpose beware my loved ones lest ye despise the merits of my learned servants whom god hath graciously chosen to be the exponents of his name “the fashioner” amidst mankind exert your utmost endeavor that ye may develop such crafts and undertakings that everyone whether young or old may benefit therefrom we are quit of those ignorant ones who fondly imagine that wisdom is to give vent to one’s idle imaginings and to repudiate god the lord of all men even as we hear some of the heedless voicing such assertions today say the beginning of wisdom and the origin thereof is to acknowledge whatsoever god hath clearly set forth for through its potency the foundation of statesmanship which is shield for the preservation of the body of mankind hath been firmly established ponder while that ye may perceive what my most exalted pen hath proclaimed in this wondrous tablet say every matter related to state affairs which ye raise for discussion falls under the shadow of one of the words sent down from the heaven of his glorious and exalted utterance thus have we recounted unto thee that which will exhilarate thy heart will bring solace to thine eyes and will enable thee to arise for the promotion of his cause amidst all peoples my nabíl let nothing grieve thee rather rejoice with exceeding gladness inasmuch as have mentioned thy name have turned my heart and my face towards thee and have conversed with thee through this irrefutable and weighty exposition ponder in thy heart upon the tribulations have sustained the imprisonment and the captivity have endured the sufferings that have befallen me and the accusations that the people have leveled against me behold they are truly wrapped in grievous veil when the discourse reached this stage the dawn of divine mysteries appeared and the light of utterance was quenched may his glory rest upon the people of wisdom as bidden by one who is the almighty the all praised say magnified be thy name lord my god beseech thee by thy name through which the splendor of the light of wisdom shone resplendent when the heavens of divine utterance were set in motion amidst mankind to graciously aid me by thy heavenly confirmations and enable me to extol thy name amongst thy servants lord unto thee have turned my face detached from all save thee and holding fast to the hem of the robe of thy manifold blessings unloose my tongue therefore to proclaim that which will captivate the minds of men and will rejoice their souls and spirits strengthen me then in thy cause in such wise that may not be hindered by the ascendancy of the oppressors among thy creatures nor withheld by the onslaught of the disbelievers amidst those who dwell in thy realm make me as lamp shining throughout thy lands that those in whose hearts the light of thy knowledge gloweth and the yearning for thy love lingereth may be guided by its radiance verily potent art thou to do whatsoever thou willest and in thy grasp thou holdest the kingdom of creation there is none other god but thee the almighty the all wise in the name of god the exalted the most high thesource of all good is trust in god submission unto his command and contentment with his holy will and pleasure the essence of wisdom is the fear of god the dread of his scourge and punishment and the apprehension of his justice and decree the essence of religion is to testify unto that which the lord hath revealed and follow that which he hath ordained in his mighty book the source of all glory is acceptance of whatsoever the lord hath bestowed and contentment with that which god hath ordained the essence of love is for man to turn his heart to the beloved one and sever himself from all else but him and desire naught save that which is the desire of his lord true remembrance is to make mention of the lord the all praised and forget aught else beside him true reliance is for the servant to pursue his profession and calling in this world to hold fast unto the lord to seek naught but his grace inasmuch as in his hands is the destiny of all his servants the essence of detachment is for man to turn his face towards the courts of the lord to enter his presence behold his countenance and stand as witness before him the essence of understanding is to testify to one’s poverty and submit to the will of the lord the sovereign the gracious the all powerful the source of courage and power is the promotion of the word of god and steadfastness in his love the essence of charity is for the servant to recount the blessings of his lord and to render thanks unto him at all times and under all conditions the essence of faith is fewness of words and abundance of deeds he whose words exceed his deeds know verily his death is better than his life the essence of true safety is to observe silence to look at the end of things and to renounce the world the beginning of magnanimity is when man expendeth his wealth on himself on his family and on the poor among his brethren in his faith the essence of wealth is love for me whoso loveth me is the possessor of all things and he that loveth me not is indeed of the poor and needy this is that which the finger of glory and splendor hath revealed the source of all evil is for man to turn away from his lord and set his heart on things ungodly the most burning fire is to question the signs of god to dispute idly that which he hath revealed to deny him and carry one’s self proudly before him the source of all learning is the knowledge of god exalted be his glory and this cannot be attained save through the knowledge of his divine manifestation the essence of abasement is to pass out from under the shadow of the merciful and seek the shelter of the evil one the source of error is to disbelieve in the one true god rely upon aught else but him and flee from his decree true loss is for him whose days have been spent in utter ignorance of his self the essence of all that we have revealed for thee is justice is for man to free himself from idle fancy and imitation discern with the eye of oneness his glorious handiwork and look into all things with searching eye thus have we instructed thee manifested unto thee words of wisdom that thou mayest be thankful unto the lord thy god and glory therein amidst all peoples out of respect the bahá’ís rather than addressing bahá’u’lláh directly would write to his amanuensis mírzá áqá ján surnamed “servant of god” and “servant in attendance the reply would be in the form of letter from mírzá áqá ján quoting words of bahá’u’lláh but would in fact be dictated in its entirety by bahá’u’lláh thus all parts of the tablet even those which ostensibly are the words of mírzá áqá ján himself are sacred scripture revealed by bahá’u’lláh the tablet of maqṣúd is in this form it was addressed to mírzá maqṣúd one of the early believers living at that time in damascus and jerusalem he is god exalted is he the lord of majesty and power praisewhich is exalted above every mention or description beseemeth the adored one the possessor of all things visible and invisible who hath enabled the primal point to reveal countless books and epistles and who through the potency of his sublime word hath called into being the entire creation whether of the former or more recent generations moreover he hath in every age and cycle in conformity with his transcendent wisdom sent forth divine messenger to revive the dispirited and despondent souls with the living waters of his utterance one who is indeed the expounder the true interpreter inasmuch as man is unable to comprehend that which hath streamed forth from the pen of glory and is recorded in his heavenly books men at all times and under all conditions stand in need of one to exhort them guide them and to instruct and teach them therefore he hath sent forth his messengers his prophets and chosen ones that they might acquaint the people with the divine purpose underlying the revelation of books and the raising up of messengers and that everyone may become aware of the trust of god which is latent in the reality of every soul man is the supreme talisman lack of proper education hath however deprived him of that which he doth inherently possess through word proceeding out of the mouth of god he was called into being by one word more he was guided to recognize the source of his education by yet another word his station and destiny were safeguarded the great being saith regard man as mine rich in gems of inestimable value education can alone cause it to reveal its treasures and enable mankind to benefit therefrom if any man were to meditate on that which the scriptures sent down from the heaven of god’s holy will have revealed he would readily recognize that their purpose is that all men shall be regarded as one soul so that the seal bearing the words “the kingdom shall be god’s” may be stamped on every heart and the light of divine bounty of grace and mercy may envelop all mankind the one true god exalted be his glory hath wished nothing for himself the allegiance of mankind profiteth him not neither doth its perversity harm him the bird of the realm of utterance voiceth continually this call “all things have willed for thee and thee too for thine own sake if the learned and worldly wise men of this age were to allow mankind to inhale the fragrance of fellowship and love every understanding heart would apprehend the meaning of true liberty and discover the secret of undisturbed peace and absolute composure were the earth to attain this station and be illumined with its light it could then be truly said of it “thou shall see in it no hollows or rising hills blessing and peace be upon him through whose advent baṭḥá is wreathed in smiles and the sweet savors of whose raiment have shed fragrance upon all mankind—he who came to protect men from that which would harm them in the world below exalted immensely exalted is his station above the glorification of all beings and sanctified from the praise of the entire creation through his advent the tabernacle of stability and order was raised throughout the world and the ensign of knowledge hoisted among the nations may blessings rest also upon his kindred and his companions through whom the standard of the unity of god and of his singleness was uplifted and the banners of celestial triumph were unfurled through them the religion of god was firmly established among his creatures and his name magnified amidst his servants entreat him—exalted is he—to shield his faith from the mischief of his enemies who tore away the veils rent them asunder and finally caused the banner of islám to be reversed amongst all peoples thy letter from which the fragrance of reunion was inhaled hath been received praised be god that following the firm decree of separation the breeze of nearness and communion hath been stirred and the soil of the heart is refreshed with the waters of joy and gladness we offer thanksgiving unto god in all circumstances and cherish the hope that he—exalted be his glory—may through his gracious providence guide all who dwell on earth towards that which is acceptable and pleasing unto him behold the disturbances which for many long year have afflicted the earth and the perturbation that hath seized its peoples it hath either been ravaged by war or tormented by sudden and unforeseen calamities though the world is encompassed with misery and distress yet no man hath paused to reflect what the cause or source of that may be whenever the true counselor uttered word in admonishment lo they all denounced him as mover of mischief and rejected his claim how bewildering how confusing is such behavior no two men can be found who may be said to be outwardly and inwardly united the evidences of discord and malice are apparent everywhere though all were made for harmony and union the great being saith well beloved ones the tabernacle of unity hath been raised regard ye not one another as strangers ye are the fruits of one tree and the leaves of one branch we cherish the hope that the light of justice may shine upon the world and sanctify it from tyranny if the rulers and kings of the earth the symbols of the power of god exalted be his glory arise and resolve to dedicate themselves to whatever will promote the highest interests of the whole of humanity the reign of justice will assuredly be established amongst the children of men and the effulgence of its light will envelop the whole earth the great being saith the structure of world stability and order hath been reared upon and will continue to be sustained by the twin pillars of reward and punishment and in another connection he hath uttered the following in the eloquent tongue justice hath mighty force at its command it is none other than reward and punishment for the deeds of men by the power of this force the tabernacle of order is established throughout the world causing the wicked to restrain their natures for fear of punishment in another passage he hath written take heed concourse of the rulers of the world there is no force on earth that can equal in its conquering power the force of justice and wisdom verily affirm that there is not and hath never been host more mighty than that of justice and wisdom blessed is the king who marcheth with the ensign of wisdom unfurled before him and the battalions of justice massed in his rear he verily is the ornament that adorneth the brow of peace and the countenance of security there can be no doubt whatever that if the daystar of justice which the clouds of tyranny have obscured were to shed its light upon men the face of the earth would be completely transformed the great being wishing to reveal the prerequisites of the peace and tranquility of the world and the advancement of its peoples hath written the time must come when the imperative necessity for the holding of vast an all embracing assemblage of men will be universally realized the rulers and kings of the earth must needs attend it and participating in its deliberations must consider such ways and means as will lay the foundations of the world’s great peace amongst men such peace demandeth that the great powers should resolve for the sake of the tranquility of the peoples of the earth to be fully reconciled among themselves should any king take up arms against another all should unitedly arise and prevent him if this be done the nations of the world will no longer require any armaments except for the purpose of preserving the security of their realms and of maintaining internal order within their territories this will ensure the peace and composure of every people government and nation we fain would hope that the kings and rulers of the earth the mirrors of the gracious and almighty name of god may attain unto this station and shield mankind from the onslaught of tyranny likewise he saith among the things which are conducive to unity and concord and will cause the whole earth to be regarded as one country is that the divers languages be reduced to one language and in like manner the scripts used in the world be confined to single script it is incumbent upon all nations to appoint some men of understanding and erudition to convene gathering and through joint consultation choose one language from among the varied existing languages or create new one to be taught to the children in all the schools of the world the day is approaching when all the peoples of the world will have adopted one universal language and one common script when this is achieved to whatsoever city man may journey it shall be as if he were entering his own home these things are obligatory and absolutely essential it is incumbent upon every man of insight and understanding to strive to translate that which hath been written into reality and action in these days the tabernacle of justice hath fallen into the clutches of tyranny and oppression beseech ye the one true god—exalted be his glory—not to deprive mankind of the ocean of true understanding for were men but to take heed they would readily appreciate that whatever hath streamed from and is set down by the pen of glory is even as the sun for the whole world and that therein lie the welfare security and true interests of all men otherwise the earth will be tormented by fresh calamity every day and unprecedented commotions will break out god grant that the people of the world may be graciously aided to preserve the light of his loving counsels within the globe of wisdom we cherish the hope that everyone may be adorned with the vesture of true wisdom the basis of the government of the world the great being saith the heaven of statesmanship is made luminous and resplendent by the brightness of the light of these blessed words which hath dawned from the dayspring of the will of god it behooveth every ruler to weigh his own being every day in the balance of equity and justice and then to judge between men and counsel them to do that which would direct their steps unto the path of wisdom and understanding this is the cornerstone of statesmanship and the essence thereof from these words every enlightened man of wisdom will readily perceive that which will foster such aims as the welfare security and protection of mankind and the safety of human lives were men of insight to quaff their fill from the ocean of inner meanings which lie enshrined in these words and become acquainted therewith they would bear witness to the sublimity and the excellence of this utterance if this lowly one were to set forth that which he perceiveth all would testify unto god’s consummate wisdom the secrets of statesmanship and that of which the people are in need lie enfolded within these words this lowly servant earnestly entreateth the one true god—exalted be his glory—to illumine the eyes of the people of the world with the splendor of the light of wisdom that they one and all may recognize that which is indispensable in this day that one indeed is man who today dedicateth himself to the service of the entire human race the great being saith blessed and happy is he that ariseth to promote the best interests of the peoples and kindreds of the earth in another passage he hath proclaimed it is not for him to pride himself who loveth his own country but rather for him who loveth the whole world the earth is but one country and mankind its citizens such exhortations to union and concord as are inscribed in the books of the prophets by the pen of the most high bear reference unto specific matters not union that would lead to disunity or concord which would create discord this is the station where measures are set unto everything station where every deserving soul shall be given his due well is it with them that appreciate the meaning and grasp the intent of these words and woe betide the heedless unto this all the evidences of nature in their very essences bear ample testimony every discerning man of wisdom is well acquainted with that which we have mentioned but not those who have strayed far from the living fountain of fairmindedness and are roving distraught in the wilderness of ignorance and blind fanaticism the great being saith ye children of men the fundamental purpose animating the faith of god and his religion is to safeguard the interests and promote the unity of the human race and to foster the spirit of love and fellowship amongst men suffer it not to become source of dissension and discord of hate and enmity this is the straight path the fixed and immovable foundation whatsoever is raised on this foundation the changes and chances of the world can never impair its strength nor will the revolution of countless centuries undermine its structure our hope is that the world’s religious leaders and the rulers thereof will unitedly arise for the reformation of this age and the rehabilitation of its fortunes let them after meditating on its needs take counsel together and through anxious and full deliberation administer to diseased and sorely afflicted world the remedy it requireth the great being saith the heaven of divine wisdom is illumined with the two luminaries of consultation and compassion take ye counsel together in all matters inasmuch as consultation is the lamp of guidance which leadeth the way and is the bestower of understanding at the outset of every endeavor it is incumbent to look to the end of it of all the arts and sciences set the children to studying those which will result in advantage to man will ensure his progress and elevate his rank thus the noisome odors of lawlessness will be dispelled and thus through the high endeavors of the nation’s leaders all will live cradled secure and in peace the great being saith the learned of the day must direct the people to acquire those branches of knowledge which are of use that both the learned themselves and the generality of mankind may derive benefits therefrom such academic pursuits as begin and end in words alone have never been and will never be of any worth the majority of persia’s learned doctors devote all their lives to the study of philosophy the ultimate yield of which is nothing but words it is incumbent upon them who are in authority to exercise moderation in all things whatsoever passeth beyond the limits of moderation will cease to exert beneficial influence consider for instance such things as liberty civilization and the like however much men of understanding may favorably regard them they will if carried to excess exercise pernicious influence upon men if this point were to be expounded an elaborate explanation would be required which it is feared might become tedious it is the ardent hope of this lowly one that god—exalted be his glory—may grant all men that which is good for he who is endowed therewith is the possessor of all things the great being saith the tongue of wisdom proclaimeth he that hath me not is bereft of all things turn ye away from all that is on earth and seek none else but me am the sun of wisdom and the ocean of knowledge cheer the faint and revive the dead am the guiding light that illumineth the way am the royal falcon on the arm of the almighty unfold the drooping wings of every broken bird and start it on its flight and likewise he saith the heaven of true understanding shineth resplendent with the light of two luminaries tolerance and righteousness my friend vast oceans lie enshrined within this brief saying blessed are they who appreciate its value drink deep therefrom and grasp its meaning and woe betide the heedless this lowly one entreateth the people of the world to observe fairness that their tender their delicate and precious hearing which hath been created to hearken unto the words of wisdom may be freed from impediments and from such allusions idle fancies or vain imaginings as “cannot fatten nor appease the hunger so that the true counselor may be graciously inclined to set forth that which is the source of blessing for mankind and of the highest good for all nations at present the light of reconciliation is dimmed in most countries and its radiance extinguished while the fire of strife and disorder hath been kindled and is blazing fiercely two great powers who regard themselves as the founders and leaders of civilization and the framers of constitutions have risen up against the followers of the faith associated with him who conversed with god be ye warned men of understanding it ill beseemeth the station of man to commit tyranny rather it behooveth him to observe equity and be attired with the raiment of justice under all conditions beseech ye the one true god that he may through the power of the hand of loving kindness and spiritual education purge and purify certain souls from the defilement of evil passions and corrupt desires that they may arise and unloose their tongues for the sake of god that perchance the evidences of injustice may be blotted out and the splendor of the light of justice may shed its radiance upon the whole world the people are ignorant and they stand in need of those who will expound the truth the great being saith the man of consummate learning and the sage endowed with penetrating wisdom are the two eyes to the body of mankind god willing the earth shall never be deprived of these two greatest gifts that which hath been set forth and will be revealed in the future is but token of this servant’s ardent desire to dedicate himself to the service of all the kindreds of the earth my friend in all circumstances one should seize upon every means which will promote security and tranquility among the peoples of the world the great being saith in this glorious day whatever will purge you from corruption and will lead you towards peace and composure is indeed the straight path please god the peoples of the world may be led as the result of the high endeavors exerted by their rulers and the wise and learned amongst men to recognize their best interests how long will humanity persist in its waywardness how long will injustice continue how long is chaos and confusion to reign amongst men how long will discord agitate the face of society this humble servant is filled with wonder inasmuch as all men are endowed with the capacity to see and hear yet we find them deprived of the privilege of using these faculties this servant hath been prompted to pen these lines by virtue of the tender love he cherisheth for thee the winds of despair are alas blowing from every direction and the strife that divideth and afflicteth the human race is daily increasing the signs of impending convulsions and chaos can now be discerned inasmuch as the prevailing order appeareth to be lamentably defective beseech god exalted be his glory that he may graciously awaken the peoples of the earth may grant that the end of their conduct may be profitable unto them and aid them to accomplish that which beseemeth their station were man to appreciate the greatness of his station and the loftiness of his destiny he would manifest naught save goodly character pure deeds and seemly and praiseworthy conduct if the learned and wise men of goodwill were to impart guidance unto the people the whole earth would be regarded as one country verily this is the undoubted truth this servant appealeth to every diligent and enterprising soul to exert his utmost endeavor and arise to rehabilitate the conditions in all regions and to quicken the dead with the living waters of wisdom and utterance by virtue of the love he cherisheth for god the one the peerless the almighty the beneficent no man of wisdom can demonstrate his knowledge save by means of words this showeth the significance of the word as is affirmed in all the scriptures whether of former times or more recently for it is through its potency and animating spirit that the people of the world have attained so eminent position moreover words and utterances should be both impressive and penetrating however no word will be infused with these two qualities unless it be uttered wholly for the sake of god and with due regard unto the exigencies of the occasion and the people the great being saith human utterance is an essence which aspireth to exert its influence and needeth moderation as to its influence this is conditional upon refinement which in turn is dependent upon hearts which are detached and pure as to its moderation this hath to be combined with tact and wisdom as prescribed in the holy scriptures and tablets every word is endowed with spirit therefore the speaker or expounder should carefully deliver his words at the appropriate time and place for the impression which each word maketh is clearly evident and perceptible the great being saith one word may be likened unto fire another unto light and the influence which both exert is manifest in the world therefore an enlightened man of wisdom should primarily speak with words as mild as milk that the children of men may be nurtured and edified thereby and may attain the ultimate goal of human existence which is the station of true understanding and nobility and likewise he saith one word is like unto springtime causing the tender saplings of the rose garden of knowledge to become verdant and flourishing while another word is even as deadly poison it behooveth prudent man of wisdom to speak with utmost leniency and forbearance so that the sweetness of his words may induce everyone to attain that which befitteth man’s station friend of mine the word of god is the king of words and its pervasive influence is incalculable it hath ever dominated and will continue to dominate the realm of being the great being saith the word is the master key for the whole world inasmuch as through its potency the doors of the hearts of men which in reality are the doors of heaven are unlocked no sooner had but glimmer of its effulgent splendor shone forth upon the mirror of love than the blessed word “i am the best beloved” was reflected therein it is an ocean inexhaustible in riches comprehending all things every thing which can be perceived is but an emanation therefrom high immeasurably high is this sublime station in whose shadow moveth the essence of loftiness and splendor wrapt in praise and adoration methinks people’s sense of taste hath alas been sorely affected by the fever of negligence and folly for they are found to be wholly unconscious and deprived of the sweetness of his utterance how regrettable indeed that man should debar himself from the fruits of the tree of wisdom while his days and hours pass swiftly away please god the hand of divine power may safeguard all mankind and direct their steps towards the horizon of true understanding verily our lord of mercy is the helper the knowing the wise would like to add that thy second letter which had been sent from jerusalem hath been received and that which thou hadst written and set forth therein was perused and read in his presence he bade me write as follows maqṣúd we have heard thy voice and perceived the sighing and lamentation thou didst raise in thy longing and eagerness praised be god the sweet savors of love could be inhaled from every word thereof please god this bounty may last for ever the servant in attendance recited the verses thou hast composed thy name is often mentioned in the presence of this wronged one and the glances of our loving kindness and compassion are directed towards thee great is the station of man great must also be his endeavors for the rehabilitation of the world and the well being of nations beseech the one true god to graciously confirm thee in that which beseemeth man’s station be thou guided by wisdom under all conditions inasmuch as persons who harbor evil motives have been and are still diligently engaged in intriguing gracious god unto that immeasurably exalted being who seeketh naught but to foster the spirit of love and fellowship amongst men and to revive the world and ennoble its life they have imputed such charges as the tongue and the pen are ashamed to recount we have remembered thee and make mention of thee now we entreat him—exalted is his glory—to protect thee with the hands of might and power and enable thee to recognize that which will serve thy best interests both in this world and in the next he is the lord of mankind the possessor of the throne on high and of the world below no god is there besides him the omnipotent the powerful god grant that this wronged one may observe fidelity he hath not forgotten nor will he ever forget thee thou hast mentioned thine intention to stay in damascus until spring then to proceed to mosul should the means be forthcoming this lowly servant entreateth god—exalted is his glory—to provide such means as is deemed expedient and to aid thee he is potent and powerful although all the inhabitants of this region have been treated with the utmost kindness yet no evidence of fellowship can be discerned from them thou shouldst observe much tact and wisdom for they seek at all times to cavil at and deny the cause may the one true god grant them equity concerning thine own affairs if thou wouldst content thyself with whatever might come to pass it would be praiseworthy to engage in some profession is highly commendable for when occupied with work one is less likely to dwell on the unpleasant aspects of life god willing thou mayest experience joy and radiance gladness and exultation in any city or land where thou mayest happen to sojourn this lowly servant will never forget that distinguished and kind friend he hath remembered and will continue to remember thee the decree lieth with god the lord of all worlds fain would hope he may vouchsafe divine assistance and grant confirmation in that which is pleasing and acceptable unto him every word of thy poetry is indeed like unto mirror in which the evidences of the devotion and love thou cherishest for god and his chosen ones are reflected well is it with thee who hast quaffed the choice wine of utterance and partaken of the soft flowing stream of true knowledge happy is he who hath drunk his fill and attained unto him and woe betide the heedless its perusal hath truly proved highly impressive for it was indicative of both the light of reunion and the fire of separation far be it from us to despair at any time of the incalculable favors of god for if it were his wish he could cause mere atom to be transformed into sun and single drop into an ocean he unlocketh thousands of doors while man is incapable of conceiving even single one so heedless is this servant that with words such as these he seeketh to vindicate the supreme power of god—exalted be his glory implore pardon of god the most great for these assertions and affirm that this servant at all times recognizeth his grievous trespasses and misdeeds he entreateth remission of his sins from the ocean of the forgiveness of his lord the most exalted and beggeth for that which will make him wholly devoted to god and enable him to utter his praise turn himself toward him and to put his whole trust in him verily he is the potent the forgiving the merciful praised be god the almighty the all knowing this lowly one hath read the descriptions of the dialogue with the traveler which thou hast recounted in thy letter to my lord may my life be offered up for his sake the explanations which were set forth awaken the people from the slumber of heedlessness indeed the actions of man himself breed profusion of satanic power for were men to abide by and observe the divine teachings every trace of evil would be banished from the face of the earth however the widespread differences that exist among mankind and the prevalence of sedition contention conflict and the like are the primary factors which provoke the appearance of the satanic spirit yet the holy spirit hath ever shunned such matters world in which naught can be perceived save strife quarrels and corruption is bound to become the seat of the throne the very metropolis of satan how vast the number of the loved and chosen ones of god who have lamented and moaned by day and by night that haply sweet and fragrant breeze might blow from the court of his good pleasure and dispel altogether the loathsome and foul smelling odors from the world however this ultimate goal could not be attained and men were deprived thereof by virtue of their evil deeds which brought upon them the retribution of god in accordance with the basic principles of his divine rule ours is the duty to remain patient in these circumstances until relief be forthcoming from god the forgiving the bountiful magnified be thy name lord of all beings and desire of all created things beseech thee by the word which hath caused the burning bush to lift up its voice and the rock to cry out whereby the well favored have hastened to attain the court of thy presence and the pure in heart the dayspring of the light of thy countenance and by the sighing of thy true lovers in their separation from thy chosen ones and by the lamentation of them that long to behold thy face before the dawning splendor of the light of thy revelation to graciously enable thy servants to recognize what thou hast ordained for them by thy bounty and thy grace prescribe for them then through thy pen of glory that which will direct their steps to the ocean of thy generosity and will lead them unto the living waters of thy heavenly reunion lord look not at the things they have wrought rather look unto the loftiness of thy celestial bounty which hath preceded all created things visible and invisible lord illumine their hearts with the effulgent light of thy knowledge and brighten their eyes with the shining splendor of the daystar of thy favors entreat thee lord of names and creator of the heavens by the blood spilt in thy path and by the heads carried aloft on spears for the sake of thy love and by the souls that have melted in their separation from thy loved ones and by the hearts broken for the exaltation of thy word to grant that the dwellers of thy realm may unite together in their allegiance to thine incomparable word so that they may all acknowledge thy unity and thy oneness there is no god but thee the omnipotent the most exalted the knowing the wise fain would hope that he who is the all sufficing the inaccessible may heed the solicitation of this lowly servant may attire the people of the world with the raiment of goodly deeds and purge them from evil inclinations he is the mighty the powerful the all wise the all perceiving he heareth and seeth he is the all hearing the all seeing he is the all knowing vafá render thanks unto thy lord for having aided thee to embrace his cause enabled thee to recognize the manifestation of his own self and raised thee up to magnify him who is the most great remembrance in this glorious announcement blessed art thou vafá inasmuch as thou hast been faithful to the covenant of god and his testament at time when all men have violated it and have repudiated the one in whom they had believed and this notwithstanding that he hath appeared invested with every testimony and hath dawned from the horizon of revelation clothed with undoubted sovereignty it behooveth thee however to exert thine utmost to attain the very essence of fidelity this implieth to be well assured in thy heart and to testify with thy tongue to that whereunto god hath testified for his own exalted self proclaiming “verily self subsisting am within the realm of glory whoso is enabled in these days to solemnly affirm this truth hath attained unto all good and the heavenly spirit shall descend upon him in the daytime and in the night season shall graciously assist him to glorify the name of his lord and suffer him to unloose his tongue and uphold with his words the cause of his lord the merciful the compassionate and none can ever achieve this except he who hath purged his heart from whatsoever is created between heaven and earth and hath entirely detached himself from all but god the sovereign lord the almighty the gracious arise thou to serve the cause and say swear by the righteousness of god verily this is the primal point arrayed in his new attire and manifested in his glorious name he at present beholdeth everything from this horizon indeed he is supreme over all things amongst the concourse on high he is known as the most great announcement and in the realms of eternity as the ancient beauty and before the throne by this name which hath caused the footsteps of them that are endued with understanding to slip say swear by god in this revelation even before single verse was sent down from the realm of holiness and sublimity the supreme testimony of god had been fulfilled for all the inmates of heaven and the dwellers on earth moreover we have revealed the equivalent of whatsoever was sent down in the dispensation of the bayán fear ye god and suffer not your deeds to be rendered vain and be not of them that are sunk in heedlessness open your eyes that ye may behold the ancient beauty from this shining and luminous station say god is my witness the promised one himself hath come down from heaven seated upon the crimson cloud with the hosts of revelation on his right and the angels of inspiration on his left and the decree hath been fulfilled at the behest of god the omnipotent the almighty thereupon the footsteps of everyone have slipped except such as god hath protected through his tender mercy and numbered with those who have recognized him through his own self and detached themselves from all that pertaineth to the world hearken thou unto the words of thy lord and purify thy heart from every illusion so that the effulgent light of the remembrance of thy lord may shed its radiance upon it and it may attain the station of certitude know thou moreover that thy letter reached our presence and we perceived and perused its contents we noted the questions thou hast asked and will readily answer thee it behooveth everyone in this day to ask god that which he desireth and thy lord will heed his petition with wondrous and undeniable verses thou hast asked regarding the subject of the return know thou that the end is like unto the beginning even as thou dost consider the beginning similarly shouldst thou consider the end and be of them that truly perceive nay rather consider the beginning as the end itself and so conversely that thou mayest acquire clear perception know thou moreover that every created thing is continually brought forth and returned at the bidding of thy lord the god of power and might as to the return as god hath purposed in his sacred and exalted tablets wherein he hath made this theme known unto his servants by this is meant the return of all created things in the day of resurrection and this is indeed the essence of the return as thou hast witnessed in god’s own days and thou art of them that testify to this truth verily god is fully capable of causing all names to appear in one name and all souls in one soul surely powerful and mighty is he and this return is realized at his behest in whatever form he willeth indeed he is the one who doeth and ordaineth all things moreover thou shouldst not perceive the fulfillment of the return and the resurrection save in the word of thy lord the almighty the all knowing for instance were he to take handful of earth and declare it to be the one whom ye have been following in the past it would undoubtedly be just and true even as his real person and to none is given the right to question his authority he doeth what he willeth and ordaineth whatsoever he pleaseth moreover in this station take thou heed not to turn thy gaze unto limitations and allusions but rather unto that whereby the revelation itself hath been fulfilled and be of them that are discerning thus do we explain for thee in lucid and explicit language that thou mayest comprehend that which thou didst seek from thine ancient lord consider thou the day of resurrection were god to pronounce the lowliest of creatures among the faithful to be the first one to believe in the bayán thou shouldst have no misgivings about it and must be of them that truly believe in this station look not upon human limitations and names but rather upon that whereby the rank of the first one to believe is vindicated which is faith in god and recognition of his being and assurance in the fulfillment of his irresistible and binding command consider thou the revelation of the point of the bayán—exalted is his glory he pronounced the first one to believe in him to be muḥammad the messenger of god doth it beseem man to dispute with him by saying that this man is from persia the other from arabia or this one was called ḥusayn while the other bore the name of muḥammad nay swear by god’s holy being the exalted the most great surely no man of intelligence and insight would ever pay attention unto limitations or names but rather unto that with which muḥammad was invested which was none other than the cause of god such man of insight would likewise consider ḥusayn and the position he occupied in the cause of god the omnipotent the exalted the knowing the wise and since the first one to believe in god in the dispensation of the bayán was invested with command similar to that with which muḥammad the messenger of god was invested therefore the báb pronounced him to be the latter namely his return and resurrection this station is sanctified from every limitation or name and naught can be seen therein but god the one the peerless the all knowing know thou moreover that in the day of revelation were he to pronounce one of the leaves to be the manifestation of all his excellent titles unto no one is given the right to utter why or wherefore and should one do so he would be regarded as disbeliever in god and be numbered with such as have repudiated his truth beware beware lest thou behave like unto the people of the bayán for indeed they erred grievously misguided the people ignored the covenant of god and his testament and joined partners with him the one the incomparable the all knowing verily they failed to recognize the point of the bayán for had they recognized him they would not have rejected his manifestation in this luminous and resplendent being and since they fixed their eyes on names therefore when he replaced his name “the most exalted” by “the most glorious” their eyes were dimmed they have failed to recognize him in these days and are reckoned with those that perish indeed had they known him through his own self or by virtue of that which he hath revealed they would not have repudiated him when he appeared in this glorious and incomparable name which god hath ordained to be the sword of his revelation between heaven and earth and through which truth is separated from error even from now until the day when mankind shall stand before the lord of the worlds know thou moreover that in the day of his manifestation all things besides god shall be brought forth and placed equally irrespective of their rank being high or low the day of return is inscrutable unto all men until after the divine revelation hath been fulfilled he is in truth the one who ordaineth whatsoever he willeth when the word of god is revealed unto all created things whoso then giveth ear and heedeth the call is indeed reckoned among the most distinguished souls though he be carrier of ashes and he who turneth away is accounted as the lowliest of his servants though he be ruler amongst men and the possessor of all the books that are in the heavens and on earth it behooveth thee to look with divine insight upon the things we have revealed and sent unto thee and not towards the people and that which is current amongst them they are in this day like unto blind man who while moving in the sunshine demandeth where is the sun is it shining he would deny and dispute the truth and would not be of them that perceive never shall he be able to discern the sun or to understand that which hath intervened between him and it he would object within himself voice protests and would be among the rebellious such is the state of this people leave them unto themselves saying unto you be that which ye desire and unto us that which we desire wretched indeed is the plight of the ungodly know thou moreover that the former manifestation affirmed that the return and rising of the spirits would occur on the day of resurrection while in truth there is return and resurrection for every created thing however we do not wish to mention aught that is not set forth in the bayán lest perchance the people of malice raise great outcry would that that which interveneth between the children of men and their creator were dispelled that they might be enabled to behold god’s invincible sovereignty and dominion quaff from the wellspring of his heavenly streams be sprinkled with the outpourings of the ocean of true understanding and be purged from the defilements of the ungodly and the suspicious as to thy question concerning the worlds of god know thou of truth that the worlds of god are countless in their number and infinite in their range none can reckon or comprehend them except god the all knowing the all wise consider thy state when asleep verily say this phenomenon is the most mysterious of the signs of god amongst men were they to ponder it in their hearts behold how the thing which thou hast seen in thy dream is after considerable lapse of time fully realized had the world in which thou didst find thyself in thy dream been identical with the world in which thou livest it would have been necessary for the event occurring in that dream to have transpired in this world at the very moment of its occurrence were it so you yourself would have borne witness unto it this being not the case however it must necessarily follow that the world in which thou livest is different and apart from that which thou hast experienced in thy dream this latter world hath neither beginning nor end it would be true if thou wert to contend that this same world is as decreed by the all glorious and almighty god within thy proper self and is wrapped up within thee it would equally be true to maintain that thy spirit having transcended the limitations of sleep and having stripped itself of all earthly attachment hath by the act of god been made to traverse realm which lieth hidden in the innermost reality of this world verily say the creation of god embraceth worlds besides this world and creatures apart from these creatures in each of these worlds he hath ordained things which none can search except himself the all searching the all wise do thou meditate on that which we have revealed unto thee that thou mayest discover the purpose of god thy lord and the lord of all worlds in these words the mysteries of divine wisdom have been treasured we have refrained from dwelling upon this theme owing to the sorrow that hath encompassed us from the actions of them that have been created through our words if ye be of them that will hearken unto our voice where is the one who can help me and shield me from the swords of these faithless souls where is the man of insight who will behold the words of god with his own eyes and rid himself of the opinions and notions of the peoples of the earth servant warn thou the servants of god not to reject that which they do not comprehend say implore god to open to your hearts the portals of true understanding that ye may be apprised of that of which no one is apprised verily he is the giver the forgiving the compassionate thou hast moreover asked me concerning the ordinances of god know thou of truth that whatsoever hath been prescribed in the book is indeed the truth no doubt is there about it and it is incumbent upon everyone to observe that which hath been sent down by him who is the revealer the all knowing were man to put them away despite his being aware thereof god would truly be clear of such one and we too would be clear of him inasmuch as his ordinances constitute the fruits of the divine tree and none other than the heedless and the wayward will deviate therefrom as to paradise it is reality and there can be no doubt about it and now in this world it is realized through love of me and my good pleasure whosoever attaineth unto it god will aid him in this world below and after death he will enable him to gain admittance into paradise whose vastness is as that of heaven and earth therein the maids of glory and holiness will wait upon him in the daytime and in the night season while the daystar of the unfading beauty of his lord will at all times shed its radiance upon him and he will shine so brightly that no one shall bear to gaze at him such is the dispensation of providence yet the people are shut out by grievous veil likewise apprehend thou the nature of hell fire and be of them that truly believe for every act performed there shall be recompense according to the estimate of god and unto this the very ordinances and prohibitions prescribed by the almighty amply bear witness for surely if deeds were not rewarded and yielded no fruit then the cause of god—exalted is he—would prove futile immeasurably high is he exalted above such blasphemies however unto them that are rid of all attachments deed is verily its own reward were we to enlarge upon this theme numerous tablets would need to be written swear by the righteousness of the one true god the pen is unable to move by reason of that which hath befallen its lord and it weepeth sore and so do weep and likewise weepeth the eye of him who is the essence of grandeur behind the tabernacle of names while seated on the throne of his glorious name purge thou thy heart that we may cause fountains of wisdom and utterance to gush out therefrom thus enabling thee to raise thy voice among all mankind unloose thy tongue and proclaim the truth for the sake of the remembrance of thy merciful lord be not afraid of anyone place thy whole trust in god the almighty the all knowing say people fulfill whatever ye understand of the persian bayán and whatever ye understand not ask this unerring remembrance that he may set forth clearly that which god hath intended in his book for in truth he knoweth that which is enshrined in the bayán by virtue of the will of him who is the omnipotent the powerful thou hast inquired about the warning we gave to the people at the time of our departure from ‘iráq to the effect that when the sun disappeareth from sight birds of darkness will be in motion and the standards of samírí will be reared high swear by god those birds have stirred in these days and samírí hath raised his clamor well is it with him who recognizeth and is numbered with men of understanding we have also warned them against the appearance of the calf god is my witness all our warnings have come to pass as indeed they are bound to inasmuch as they have issued from the fingers of glory and might beseech thou god to protect thee from the mischief of these men and to purify thee from the insinuations of the froward strengthen thy loins then for the promotion of the cause and pay no attention unto the words uttered by the people of the bayán for they are truly incapable of understanding and have failed to comprehend the essence of the cause as is revealed in this august this most great announcement thus have we inspired thee and infused into thy heart that which will make thee independent of the allusions of mankind the glory of god be upon thee and upon them that give ear unto the words thou dost utter for the love of god thy lord and remain steadfast in his cause all praise be unto god the lord of the worlds he is the most holy the most great the most exalted the most high myname yield thou praise unto god for having graciously chosen thee to be shower of bounty for that which we have sown in the pure and blessed soil and enabled thee to serve as springtime of tender mercy for the wondrous and sublime trees we have planted indeed so great is this favor that of all created things in the world of existence none can ever hope to rival it we have moreover given thee to drink the choice wine of utterance from the chalice of the heavenly bestowals of thy merciful lord which is none other than this tongue of holiness—a tongue that as soon as it was unloosed quickened the entire creation set in motion all beings and caused the nightingale to pour forth its melodies this is the fountain of living water for all that dwell in the realm of being oftentimes have we wafted upon thee the sweet savors of the all merciful from this branch which moveth over the tablet of thy lord the mighty the unconstrained by the righteousness of the one true god were all created things visible and invisible to direct themselves towards him thou wouldst find them winging their flight unto the supreme goal the spot wherein the divine lote tree exclaimeth verily no god is there but me the almighty the all bountiful great is thy blessedness inasmuch as thou hast been journeying throughout the lands of god and been the embodiment of joy and assurance for the people of bahá who have renounced all else but him and set their hearts towards this court which hath shed its radiance upon all realms and sprinkled them with the surging waters of this ocean wherewith thou thyself hast been sprinkled—an ocean which hath encompassed all created things indeed thou didst grasp the significance of rendering assistance unto god and didst arise to achieve this through the power of wisdom and utterance say to assist me is to teach my cause this is theme with which whole tablets are laden this is the changeless commandment of god eternal in the past eternal in the future comprehend this ye men of insight they that have passed beyond the bounds of wisdom fail to understand the meaning of assisting god as set forth in the book say fear ye god and sow not the seeds of dissension amongst men observe ye that which hath been enjoined upon you by your lord the almighty the all knowing he knoweth the reality of victory and hath taught it to you with an utterance that the vain imaginings of them that rove distraught in the wilderness of doubt can never corrupt my name suffer all created things to quaff once again from this chalice which hath caused the seas to rise kindle then in the hearts the blazing fire which this crimson tree hath ignited that they may arise to extol and magnify his name amidst the adherents of all faiths numerous letters from thee have been presented before our throne we have perused them as token of grace on our part and for each name thou didst mention therein we have revealed that which will stir the minds of men and will cause the spirits to soar moreover we have repeatedly enabled thee to hearken unto the warblings of the birds of heaven and to incline thine ear to the songs of the nightingales pouring forth their melodies upon the branches thus was the pen of god set in motion in thy remembrance that thou mightest admonish men through the power of this utterance which is divinely ordained to be the revealer of the signs of his glory blessed is the spot wherein the anthem of his praise is raised and blessed the ear that hearkeneth unto that which hath been sent down from the heaven of the loving kindness of thy lord the all merciful exhort thou the servants of god unto that whereunto we have exhorted thee that they may abstain from whatsoever is forbidden them in the mother book those who perpetrate deeds that would create turmoil among the people have indeed strayed far from helping god and his cause and are numbered with the mischief makers in the tablet which god hath designated to be the dawning place of all tablets say if it be our pleasure we shall render the cause victorious through the power of single word from our presence he is in truth the omnipotent the all compelling should it be god’s intention there would appear out of the forests of celestial might the lion of indomitable strength whose roaring is like unto the peals of thunder reverberating in the mountains however since our loving providence surpasseth all things we have ordained that complete victory should be achieved through speech and utterance that our servants throughout the earth may thereby become the recipients of divine good this is but token of god’s bounty vouchsafed unto them verily thy lord is the all sufficing the most exalted say fear ye god and commit not such deeds as would cause my loved ones on earth to lament thus biddeth you this pen which hath set the pen of glory in motion within the arena of wisdom and true understanding convey my greetings unto those whose faces mirror forth the radiance of bahá then mention to them this utterance which cheereth the eyes of the righteous the glory of god rest upon thee and upon such as have firmly clung to the cord of god the revealer of verses restrain thou the inhabitants of those regions from provocative acts from strife dissension or aught else that would create trouble that which is praiseworthy in these days is the promotion of the cause for instance if those people who pursue certain aims were to dedicate themselves to the teaching of the cause all the dwellers of those regions would ere long be invested with the mantle of faith should anyone perceive the sweetness of the following passage in the tablet revealed in honor of nabíl of qá’in he would readily comprehend the significance of assistance human utterance is an essence which aspireth to exert its influence and needeth moderation as to its influence this is conditional upon refinement which in turn is dependent upon hearts which are detached and pure as to its moderation this hath to be combined with tact and wisdom as prescribed in the holy scriptures and tablets my name utterance must needs possess penetrating power for if bereft of this quality it would fail to exert influence and this penetrating influence dependeth on the spirit being pure and the heart stainless likewise it needeth moderation without which the hearer would be unable to bear it rather he would manifest opposition from the very outset and moderation will be obtained by blending utterance with the tokens of divine wisdom which are recorded in the sacred books and tablets thus when the essence of one’s utterance is endowed with these two requisites it will prove highly effective and will be the prime factor in transforming the souls of men this is the station of supreme victory and celestial dominion whoso attaineth thereto is invested with the power to teach the cause of god and to prevail over the hearts and minds of men my name the daystar of utterance shining resplendent from the dayspring of divine revelation hath so illumined the scrolls and tablets that the kingdom of utterance and the exalted dominion of understanding vibrate with joy and ecstasy and shine forth with the splendor of his light yet the generality of mankind comprehend not the reason why the subject of aid and assistance hath time and again streamed and will continue to stream from the pen of providence is to warn the friends of god lest they engage in activities that would give rise to strife and turmoil it is incumbent upon them one and all to diligently seek ways to help the cause of god in such manner as we have explained this is but token of his grace especially conferred upon his loved ones that every one of them may attain the station characterized by the words “whoso quickeneth soul hath verily quickened all mankind temporal ascendancy hath been and will continue to be under the shadow of this station its appointed hour is preordained in the book of god he is truly cognizant thereof and it will be manifested through the potency of his might verily he is the powerful the all subduing the omnipotent the all knowing the all wise the sanctified souls should ponder and meditate in their hearts regarding the methods of teaching from the texts of the wondrous heavenly scriptures they should memorize phrases and passages bearing on various instances so that in the course of their speech they may recite divine verses whenever the occasion demandeth it inasmuch as these holy verses are the most potent elixir the greatest and mightiest talisman so potent is their influence that the hearer will have no cause for vacillation swear by my life this revelation is endowed with such power that it will act as the lodestone for all nations and kindreds of the earth should one pause to meditate attentively he would recognize that no place is there nor can there be for anyone to flee to in such manner hath the kitáb aqdas been revealed that it attracteth and embraceth all the divinely appointed dispensations blessed those who peruse it blessed those who apprehend it blessed those who meditate upon it blessed those who ponder its meaning so vast is its range that it hath encompassed all men ere their recognition of it ere long will its sovereign power its pervasive influence and the greatness of its might be manifested on earth verily thy god is the all knowing the all informed my name hearken thou unto my voice coming from the direction of my throne he wisheth to make mention of thy name at all times inasmuch as thou hast proved thyself steadfast in extolling his virtues amongst men indeed thy lord loveth fidelity as found in the realm of creation and he hath given it precedence over most of the praiseworthy qualities verily he is potent and powerful know thou moreover that we have heard the praise thou hast uttered in thy communion with god thy lord the exalted the gracious great indeed is the blessedness awaiting thee inasmuch as thou hast curtailed thine own affairs in favor of this inviolable this mighty and enlightened cause we entreat god to make thy call magnet which will attract the embodiments of names in the world of existence that all beings may spontaneously hasten to heed it no god is there besides him the exalted the preeminent the ever blessed the sublime the most august the most glorious the most bountiful the all knowing the all informed this tablet was revealed after the martyrdom of the king of martyrs and the beloved of martyrs seegod passes by chapter viii paragraph beginning “in iṣfahán mullá káẓim was beheaded…” and was addressed toshaykhmuḥammad báqir denounced by bahá’u’lláh as the “wolf in this tablet bahá’u’lláh refers to mír muḥammad ḥusayn the imám jum’ih of iṣfáhán surnamed the “she serpent who

najafi the son ofshaykhmuḥammad báqir heis the almighty the all knowing the all wise the winds of hatred have encompassed the ark of baṭḥá by reason of that which the hands of the oppressors have wrought báqir thou hast pronounced sentence against them for whom the books of the world have wept and in whose favor the scriptures of all religions have testified thou who art gone far astray art indeed wrapt in thick veil by god himself thou hast pronounced judgment against them through whom the horizon of faith hath been illumined unto this bear witness they who are the dawning places of revelation and the manifestations of the cause of thy lord the most merciful who have sacrificed their souls and all that they possessed in his straight path the faith of god hath cried everywhere by reason of thy tyranny and yet thou disportest thyself and art of them that exult there is no hatred in mine heart for thee nor for anyone every man of learning beholdeth thee and such as are like thee engulfed in evident folly hadst thou realized that which thou hast done thou wouldst have cast thyself into the fire or abandoned thine home and fled into the mountains or wouldst have groaned until thou hadst returned unto the place destined for thee by him who is the lord of strength and of might thou who art even as nothing rend thou asunder the veils of idle fancies and vain imaginings that thou mayest behold the daystar of knowledge shining from this resplendent horizon thou hast torn in pieces remnant of the prophet himself and imagined that thou hadst helped the faith of god thus hath thy soul prompted thee and thou art truly one of the heedless thine act hath consumed the hearts of the concourse on high and those of such as have circled round the cause of god the lord of the worlds the soul of the chaste one melted by reason of thy cruelty and the inmates of paradise wept sore in that blessed spot judge thou fairly adjure thee by god what proof did the jewish doctors adduce wherewith to condemn him who was the spirit of god when he came unto them with truth what could have been the evidence produced by the pharisees and the idolatrous priests to justify their denial of muḥammad the apostle of god when he came unto them with book that judged between truth and falsehood with justice which turned into light the darkness of the earth and enraptured the hearts of such as had known him indeed thou hast produced in this day the same proofs which the foolish divines advanced in that age unto this testifieth he who is the king of the realm of grace in this great prison thou hast truly walked in their ways nay hast surpassed them in their cruelty and hast deemed thyself to be helping the faith and defending the law of god the all knowing the all wise by him who is the truth thine iniquity hath made gabriel to groan and hath drawn tears from the law of god through which the breezes of justice have been wafted over all who are in heaven and on earth hast thou fondly imagined that the judgment thou didst pronounce hath profited thee nay by him who is the king of all names unto thy loss testifieth he with whom is the knowledge of all things as recorded in the preserved tablet when thou didst pen thy judgment thou wast accused by thy very pen unto this doth bear witness the pen of god the most high in his inaccessible station thou who hast gone astray thou hast neither seen me nor associated with me nor been my companion for the fraction of moment how is it then that thou hast bidden men to curse me didst thou in this follow the promptings of thine own desires or didst thou obey thy lord produce thou sign if thou art one of the truthful we testify that thou hast cast behind thy back the law of god and laid hold on the dictates of thy passions nothing in truth escapeth his knowledge he verily is the incomparable the all informed heedless one hearken unto that which the merciful hath revealed in the qur’án “say not to every one who meeteth you with greeting ‘thou art not believer ’” thus hath he decreed in whose grasp are the kingdoms of revelation and of creation if thou be of them that hearken thou hast set aside the commandment of god and clung unto the promptings of thine own desire woe then unto thee careless one that doubtest if thou deniest me by what proof canst thou vindicate the truth of that which thou dost possess produce it then thou who hast joined partners with god and turned aside from his sovereignty that hath encompassed the worlds foolish one know thou that he is truly learned who hath acknowledged my revelation and drunk from the ocean of my knowledge and soared in the atmosphere of my love and cast away all else besides me and taken firm hold on that which hath been sent down from the kingdom of my wondrous utterance he verily is even as an eye unto mankind and as the spirit of life unto the body of all creation glorified be the all merciful who hath enlightened him and caused him to arise and serve his great and mighty cause verily such man is blessed by the concourse on high and by them who dwell within the tabernacle of grandeur who have quaffed my sealed wine in my name the omnipotent the all powerful báqir if thou be of them that occupy such sublime station produce then sign from god the creator of the heavens and shouldst thou recognize thy powerlessness do thou rein in thy passions and return unto thy lord that perchance he may forgive thee thy sins which have caused the leaves of the divine lote tree to be burnt up and the rock to cry out and the eyes of men of understanding to weep because of thee the veil of divinity was rent asunder and the ark foundered and the she camel was hamstrung and the spirit groaned in his sublime retreat disputest thou with him who hath come unto thee with the testimonies of god and his signs which thou possessest and which are in the possession of them that dwell on earth open thine eyes that thou mayest behold this wronged one shining forth above the horizon of the will of god the sovereign the truth the resplendent unstop then the ear of thine heart that thou mayest hearken unto the speech of the divine lote tree that hath been raised up in truth by god the almighty the beneficent verily this tree notwithstanding the things that befell it by reason of thy cruelty and of the transgressions of such as are like thee calleth aloud and summoneth all men unto the sadratu’l muntahá and the supreme horizon blessed is the soul that hath gazed on the most mighty sign and the ear that hath heard his most sweet voice and woe to whosoever hath turned aside and done wickedly thou who hast turned away from god wert thou to look with the eye of fairness upon the divine lote tree thou wouldst perceive the marks of thy sword on its boughs and its branches and its leaves notwithstanding that god created thee for the purpose of recognizing and of serving it reflect that haply thou mayest recognize thine iniquity and be numbered with such as have repented thinkest thou that we fear thy cruelty know thou and be well assured that from the first day whereon the voice of the most sublime pen was raised betwixt earth and heaven we offered up our souls and our bodies and our sons and our possessions in the path of god the exalted the great and we glory therein amongst all created things and the concourse on high unto this testify the things which have befallen us in this straight path by god our hearts were consumed and our bodies were crucified and our blood was spilt while our eyes were fixed on the horizon of the loving kindness of their lord the witness the all seeing the more grievous their woes the greater waxed the love of the people of bahá unto their sincerity hath borne witness what the all merciful hath sent down in the qur’án he saith “wish ye then for death if ye are sincere who is to be preferred he that hath sheltered himself behind curtains or he that hath offered himself in the path of god judge thou fairly and be not of them that rove distraught in the wilderness of falsehood so carried away have they been by the living waters of the love of the most merciful that neither the arms of the world nor the swords of the nations have deterred them from setting their faces towards the ocean of the bounty of their lord the giver the generous by god troubles have failed to unnerve me and the repudiation of the divines hath been powerless to weaken me have spoken and still speak forth before the face of men “the door of grace hath been unlocked and he who is the dayspring of justice is come with perspicuous signs and evident testimonies from god the lord of strength and of might present thyself before me that thou mayest hear the mysteries which were heard by the son of ‘imrán upon the sinai of wisdom thus commandeth thee he who is the dawning place of the revelation of thy lord the god of mercy from his great prison hath leadership made thee proud peruse thou what god hath revealed to the sovereign ruler the sulṭán of turkey who hath incarcerated me in this fortified stronghold so that thou mayest be informed of the condition of this wronged one as decreed by god the one the single the all informed art thou happy to see the abject and worthless as thy followers they support thee as did people before them they that followed annas who without clear proof and testimony pronounced judgment against the spirit peruse thou the kitáb íqán and that which the all merciful hath sent down unto the king of paris and to such as are like him that thou mayest be made aware of the things that have transpired in the past and be persuaded that we have not sought to spread disorder in the land after it had been well ordered we exhort wholly for the sake of god his servants let him who wisheth turn unto him and him who wisheth turn aside our lord the merciful is verily the all sufficing the all praised concourse of divines this is the day whereon nothing amongst all things nor any name amongst all names can profit you save through this name which god hath made the manifestation of his cause and the dayspring of his most excellent titles unto all who are in the kingdom of creation blessed is that man that hath recognized the fragrance of the all merciful and been numbered with the steadfast your sciences shall not profit you in this day nor your arts nor your treasures nor your glory cast them all behind your backs and set your faces towards the most sublime word through which the scriptures and the books and this lucid tablet have been distinctly set forth cast away concourse of divines the things ye have composed with the pens of your idle fancies and vain imaginings by god the daystar of knowledge hath shone forth above the horizon of certitude báqir read and call thou to mind that which was said of old by believer of thy stock “will ye slay man because he saith my lord is god when he hath already come to you with signs from your lord if he be liar on him will be his lie but if he be man of truth part of what he threateneth will fall upon you in truth god guideth not him who is transgressor liar thou who art gone astray if thou hast any doubt concerning our conduct know thou that we bear witness unto that whereunto god hath himself borne witness ere the creation of the heavens and of the earth that there is none other god but him the almighty the all bounteous we testify that he is one in his essence one in his attributes he hath none to equal him in the whole universe nor any partner in all creation he hath sent forth his messengers and sent down his books that they may announce unto his creatures the straight path hath thesháh been informed and chosen to close his eyes to thine acts or hath he been seized with fear at the howling of pack of wolves who have cast the path of god behind their backs and followed in thy way without any clear proof or book we have heard that the provinces of persia have been adorned with the adornment of justice when we observed closely however we found them to be the dawning places of tyranny and the daysprings of injustice we behold justice in the clutches of tyranny we beseech god to set it free through the power of his might and his sovereignty he verily overshadoweth all that is in the heavens and on earth to none is given the right to protest against anyone concerning that which hath befallen the cause of god it behooveth whosoever hath set his face towards the most sublime horizon to cleave tenaciously unto the cord of patience and to put his reliance in god the help in peril the unconstrained ye loved ones of god drink your fill from the wellspring of wisdom and walk ye in the garden of wisdom and soar ye in the atmosphere of wisdom and speak forth with wisdom and eloquence thus biddeth you your lord the almighty the all knowing báqir rely not on thy glory and thy power thou art even as the last trace of sunlight upon the mountaintop soon will it fade away as decreed by god the all possessing the most high thy glory and the glory of such as are like thee have been taken away and this verily is what hath been ordained by the one with whom is the mother tablet where is he to be found who contended with god and whither is gone he that gainsaid his signs and turned aside from his sovereignty where are they who have slain his chosen ones and spilt the blood of his holy ones reflect that haply thou mayest perceive the breaths of thine acts foolish doubter because of you the apostle lamented and the chaste one cried out and the countries were laid waste and darkness fell upon all regions concourse of divines because of you the people were abased and the banner of islám was hauled down and its mighty throne subverted every time man of discernment hath sought to hold fast unto that which would exalt islám ye raised clamor and thereby was he deterred from achieving his purpose while the land remained fallen in clear ruin consider the sulṭán of turkey he did not want war but those like you desired it when its fires were enkindled and its flames rose high the government and the people were thereby weakened unto this beareth witness every man of equity and perception its calamities waxed so great that the smoke thereof surrounded the land of mystery and its environs and what had been revealed in the tablet of the sulṭán was made manifest thus hath it been decreed in the book at the behest of god the help in peril the self subsisting my supreme pen leave thou the mention of the wolf and call thou to remembrance the she serpent whose cruelty hath caused all created things to groan and the limbs of the holy ones to quake thus biddeth thee the lord of all names in this glorious station the chaste one hath cried out by reason of thine iniquity and yet thou dost imagine thyself to be of the family of the apostle of god thus hath thy soul prompted thee thou who hast withdrawn thyself from god the lord of all that hath been and shall be judge thou equitably she serpent for what crime didst thou sting the children of the apostle of god and pillage their possessions hast thou denied him who created thee by his command “be and it was” thou hast dealt with the children of the apostle of god as neither ‘ád hath dealt with húd northamúd with ṣáliḥ nor the jews with the spirit of god the lord of all being gainsayest thou the signs of thy lord which no sooner were sent down from the heaven of his cause than all the books of the world bowed down before them meditate that thou mayest be made aware of thine act heedless outcast ere long will the breaths of chastisement seize thee as they seized others before thee wait thou who hast joined partners with god the lord of the visible and the invisible this is the day which god hath announced through the tongue of his apostle reflect that thou mayest apprehend what the all merciful hath sent down in the qur’án and in this inscribed tablet this is the day whereon he who is the dayspring of revelation hath come with clear tokens which none can number this is the day whereon every man endued with perception hath discovered the fragrance of the breeze of the all merciful in the world of creation and every man of insight hath hastened unto the living waters of the mercy of his lord the king of kings heedless one the tale of the sacrifice hath been retold and he who was to be offered up hath directed his steps towards the place of sacrifice and returned not by reason of that which thy hand hath wrought perverse hater didst thou imagine that martyrdom could abase this cause nay by him whom god hath made to be the repository of his revelation if thou be of them that comprehend woe betide thee thou who hast joined partners with god and woe betide them that have taken thee as their leader without clear token or perspicuous book how numerous the oppressors before thee who have arisen to quench the light of god and how many the impious who murdered and pillaged until the hearts and souls of men groaned by reason of their cruelty the sun of justice hath been obscured inasmuch as the embodiment of tyranny hath been stablished upon the throne of hatred and yet the people understand not the children of the apostle have been slain and their possessions pillaged say was it in thine estimation their possessions or themselves that denied god judge fairly ignorant one that hath been shut out as by veil from god thou hast clung to tyranny and cast away justice whereupon all created things have lamented and still thou art among the wayward thou hast put to death the aged and plundered the young thinkest thou that thou wilt consume that which thine iniquity hath amassed nay by myself thus informeth thee he who is cognizant of all by god the things thou possessest shall profit thee not nor what thou hast laid up through thy cruelty unto this beareth witness thy lord the all knowing thou hast arisen to put out the light of this cause ere long will thine own fire be quenched at his behest he verily is the lord of strength and of might the changes and chances of the world and the powers of the nations cannot frustrate him he doeth what he pleaseth and ordaineth what he willeth through the power of his sovereignty consider the she camel though but beast yet hath the all merciful exalted her to so high station that the tongues of the earth made mention of her and celebrated her praise he verily overshadoweth all that is in the heavens and on earth no god is there but him the almighty the great thus have we adorned the heaven of our tablet with the suns of our words blessed the man that hath attained thereunto and been illumined with their light and woe betide such as have turned aside and denied him and strayed far from him praised be god the lord of the worlds althoughthe realm of glory hath none of the vanities of the world yet within the treasury of trust and

souls who seemed to be intensely eager and athirst yet when the ocean of living waters did surge forth in the world of being they remained deprived thereof inasmuch as they failed to relinquish idle fancy and to become consciously aware of him who is the object of all knowledge this failure is in recompense for the deeds their hands had formerly wrought render thou thanks unto the beloved of the world for having graciously aided thee to attain confirmation in this glorious cause entreat him moreover to make his loved ones steadfast therein for the inflammatory writings of the mischief makers are widespread and the clamor of the foreboders of evil is raised high happy are they that have cast behind their backs all else save god and have held fast unto that which the lord of strength and power hath enjoined upon them his glory be upon thee and upon such as have been enabled to recognize and embrace this mighty cause thisis tablet which the lord of all being hath sent down from his glorious station in honor of him who hath believed in god the almighty the all loving blessed is the wayfarer who hath recognized the desired one and the seeker who hath heeded the call of him who is the intended aim of all mankind and the learned one who hath believed in god the help in peril the self subsisting how vast the number of the learned who have turned aside from the way of god and how numerous the men devoid of learning who have apprehended the truth and hastened unto him saying “praised be thou lord of all things visible and invisible by the righteousness of god the world’s horizon is resplendent with the light of the most great luminary yet the generality of mankind perceive it not verily he who is the sovereign truth moveth before the eyes of all men unto this beareth witness the one who is proclaiming in the midmost heart of the world “in truth no god is there but me omnipotent over all things whether of the past or of the future great is the blessedness of the believer who hath directed himself towards him and hath gained admittance into his presence and woe betide every disbeliever who hath turned away from god and followed the wayward and the outcast friend in the bayán we directed everyone in this most great revelation to see with his own eyes and hear with his own ears however when the horizon of the world was illumined with the resplendent light of this revelation many people forgot this divine commandment lost sight of this heavenly exhortation and immersed themselves in the vain imaginings which their minds had devised indeed the face of the sun of justice and fairness is hidden behind the clouds of idle fancy which the foolish ones have conceived therefore it is not to be wondered at that the movements of the birds of darkness attract attention through the potency of the name of the best beloved invite thou the receptive souls unto god’s holy court that perchance they may not remain deprived of the heavenly fountain of living water he is in truth the gracious the forgiving the gaze of the loving kindness of god—exalted and glorified is he—hath everlastingly been directed towards his beloved friends verily he is the one who knoweth and remembereth javád such is the greatness of this day that the hour itself is seized with perturbation and all heavenly scriptures bear evidence to its overpowering majesty in this day the book solemnly testifieth to his glory and the balance is moved to lift up its voice this is the day wherein the ṣiraṭ calleth aloud “i am the straight path and mount sinai exclaimeth “verily the lord of revelation is come being overcome by the drunkenness of corrupt inclinations the people of the earth find themselves in state of stupor they are therefore debarred from the wondrous signs of god are prevented from attaining the ultimate goal and are deprived of the liberal effusions of divine grace it behooveth the people of god to be forbearing they should impart the word of god according to the hearer’s particular measure of understanding and capacity that perchance the children of men may be roused from heedlessness and set their faces towards this horizon which is immeasurably exalted above every horizon javád the manifold bounties of god have ever been and will continue to be vouchsafed unto thee praised be god thou hast been shielded from the most great terror and hast succeeded in drawing nigh unto the most great bounty at time when all men were prevented from recognizing the eternal king by the interposition of the veils of outward glory namely the divines of this day cherish thou as dearly as thine own life this testimony pronounced by the all glorious pen and strive with all thy might to preserve it by the potency of the name of him who is the beloved one of the entire creation that this sublime honor may be proof against the eyes and the hands of robbers verily thy lord is the expounder the all knowing convey the greetings of this wronged one unto all the beloved friends in that region and call to their minds our wondrous and exalted remembrances that haply they may forsake the things current amongst them may set their hearts on that which pertaineth unto god and remain purged from unseemly deeds and pursuits may the glory of the almighty the all wise be upon thee and upon such as are related unto thee wemake mention of him who hath been attracted by our call when it was raised from the summit of transcendent glory and hath set his face towards god the lord of creation he is numbered with such as have heard and responded to the summons of their lord at time when the peoples of the world are wrapt in palpable veils he testifieth unto that whereunto god hath testified and acknowledgeth his belief in that which the tongue of grandeur hath uttered unto this beareth witness the lord of names in this wondrous tablet my exalted pen bring him on my behalf the joyful tidings concerning the things that god the powerful the omnipotent hath reserved for him indeed he hath for most of the time been hemmed in by manifold sorrows and verily his merciful lord is the one who seeth and knoweth all things rejoice thou with exceeding gladness inasmuch as this wronged one hath turned his face towards thee hath mentioned thy name aforetime and doth mention it at this very moment unto my loved friends give thou remembrances in my name and convey to them the tidings of the gracious bounties of their lord the giver the all generous from this exalted station we send our greetings unto such believers as have taken fast hold on the sure handle and quaffed the choice wine of constancy from the hand of favor of their lord the almighty the all praised in this day the faculty of hearing exclaimeth “this is my day wherein hearken unto the wondrous voice coming from the precincts of the prison of my lord the perspicuous the hearing and the faculty of sight calleth aloud “verily this is my day for behold the dayspring of glory shining resplendent at the bidding of him who is the ordainer the all powerful blessed the ear that hath heard the call “behold and thou shalt see me and happy the eye that hath gazed upon the most wondrous sign dawning from this luminous horizon say concourse of the rulers and of the learned and the wise the promised day is come and the lord of hosts hath appeared rejoice ye with great joy by reason of this supreme felicity aid him then through the power of wisdom and utterance thus biddeth you the one who hath ever proclaimed “verily no god is there but me the all knowing the all wise

as the seat of the throne of thy lord the exalted the mighty bear witness that thou hast hearkened unto the melody of god and his sweet accents inclined thine ear to the cooing of the dove of divine revelation and hast heard the nightingale of fidelity pouring forth its notes upon the branch of glory verily there is none other god but me the incomparable the all informed thou who bearest my name the glances of the loving kindness of god have been and continue to be directed towards thee while in his presence thou hast heard the voice of the one true god—exalted be his glory—and hast beheld the unveiled splendor of the light of divine knowledge ponder while how sublime is the utterance of him who is the sovereign truth and how abject are the idle contentions of the people the accumulations of vain fancy have obstructed men’s ears and stopped them from hearing the voice of god and the veils of human learning and false imaginings have prevented their eyes from beholding the splendor of the light of his countenance with the arm of might and power we have rescued number of souls from the slough of impending extinction and enabled them to attain the dayspring of glory moreover we have laid bare the divine mysteries and in most explicit language foretold future events that neither the doubts of the faithless nor the denials of the froward nor the whisperings of the heedless may keep back the seekers of truth from the source of the light of the one true god nevertheless some people seem to have been seized with epilepsy others are torn up even as hollow tree stumps they abandon god the most exalted—he before whose revelation of single verse all the scriptures of the past and of more recent times pale into lowliness and insignificance—and set their hearts on lying tales and follow empty words thou hast surely quaffed from the ocean of mine utterance and hast witnessed the effulgent splendor of the orb of my wisdom thou hast also heard the sayings of the infidels who neither are acquainted with the fundamentals of the faith nor have tasted this choice wine whose seal hath been broken through the power of my name the help in peril the self subsisting beseech thou god that the believers who are endued with true understanding may be graciously enabled to do that which is pleasing unto him how strange that despite this ringing call despite the appearance of this most wondrous revelation we notice that men for the most part have fixed their hearts on the vanities of the world and are sorely dismayed and troubled by reason of prevailing doubts and evil suggestions say this is the day of god himself fear ye god and be not of them that have disbelieved in him cast the idle tales behind your backs and behold my revelation through mine eyes unto this have ye been exhorted in heavenly books and scriptures in the scrolls and tablets arise thou to serve the cause of thy lord then give the people the joyful tidings concerning this resplendent light whose revelation hath been announced by god through his prophets and messengers admonish everyone moreover to observe prudence as ordained by him and in the name of god advise them saying it behooveth every one in this day of god to dedicate himself to the teaching of the cause with utmost prudence and steadfastness should he discover pure soil let him sow the seed of the word of god otherwise it would be preferable to observe silence not long ago this most sublime word was revealed in the crimson book by the all glorious pen “the heaven of divine wisdom is illumined with two luminaries consultation and compassion please god everyone may be enabled to observe this weighty and blessed word certain people seem to be entirely bereft of understanding by clinging to the cord of idle fancy they have debarred themselves from the sure handle swear by my life were they to reflect while with fairness on that which the all merciful hath sent down they would one and all spontaneously give utterance to these words “verily thou art the truth the manifest truth it behooveth thee to turn thy gaze in all circumstances unto the one true god and seek diligently to serve his cause call thou to mind when thou wert in my company within the tabernacle of glory and didst hear from me that which he who conversed with god moses heard upon the sinai of divine knowledge thus did we graciously aid thee enabled thee to recognize the truth and cautioned thee that thou mightest render thanks unto thy bountiful lord thou shouldst safeguard this sublime station through the potency of my name the omnipotent the faithful convey greetings on my behalf to my loved ones and suffer them to hearken unto my sweet voice thus biddeth thee the one who hath bidden thee in the past am in truth the ordainer the all informed glory be upon thee and upon those who give ear to thy words concerning this momentous cause and who love thee for the sake of god the lord of the worlds ḥaydar this wronged one hath heard thy voice raised in the service of the cause of god and is well aware of the feeling of joy which his love hath roused in thy heart and of thy pangs of anguish at that which hath befallen his loved ones swear by the lord of mercy the whole world is overwhelmed with sorrow whilst mankind is perplexed with doubts and dissensions the people of god the lord of names are so grievously beset by enemies that the supreme paradise hath lamented and the inmates of highest heaven and those who day and night circle round the throne have groaned aloud ‘alí woes and sorrows are powerless to restrain thy lord the all merciful indeed he hath risen to champion the cause of god in such wise that neither the overpowering might of the world nor the tyranny of the nations can ever alarm him he calleth aloud betwixt earth and heaven saying the promised day is come the lord of creation proclaimeth verily there is no god besides me the almighty the all bountiful ‘alí the immature wish to put out the light of god with their mouths and to extinguish by their acts the flame in the burning bush say wretched indeed is your plight ye embodiments of delusion fear ye god and reject not the heavenly grace which hath shed radiance upon all regions say he who is the exponent of the hidden name hath appeared did ye but know it he whose advent hath been foretold in the heavenly scriptures is come could ye but understand it the world’s horizon is illumined by the splendors of this most great revelation haste ye with radiant hearts and be not of them that are bereft of understanding the appointed hour hath struck and mankind is laid low unto this bear witness the honored servants of god ḥaydar ‘alí swear by the righteousness of god the blast hath been blown on the trumpet of the bayán as decreed by the lord the merciful and all that are in the heavens and on the earth have swooned away except such as have detached themselves from the world cleaving fast unto the cord of god the lord of mankind this is the day in which the earth shineth with the effulgent light of thy lord but the people are lost in error and have been shut out as by veil we desire to regenerate the world yet they have resolved to put an end to my life thus have their hearts prompted them in this day—a day which hath been made bright by the radiant light of the countenance of its lord the omnipotent the almighty the unconstrained the mother book hath lifted up its voice but the people are bereft of hearing the preserved tablet hath been revealed with truth yet the generality of mankind peruse it not they have denied the gracious favor of god after it hath been sent down unto them and have turned away from god the knower of things unseen they firmly cling to the hem of idle fancies turning their backs on the hidden name of the almighty say concourse of divines be fair in your judgment adjure you by god produce then whatever proofs and testimonies ye possess if ye are to be reckoned among the inmates of this glorious habitation set your hearts towards the dayspring of divine revelation that we may disclose before your eyes the equivalent of all such verses proofs testimonies affirmations and evidences as ye and other kindreds of the earth possess fear ye god and be not of them that well deserve the chastisement of god the lord of creation this is the day in which the ocean of knowledge hath lifted up its voice and hath brought forth its pearls would that ye knew it the heaven of the bayán hath been raised up in truth at the behest of god the help in peril the self subsisting swear by god the essence of knowledge exclaimeth and saith lo he who is the object of all knowledge is come and through his advent the sacred books of god the gracious the loving have been embellished every revelation of grace every evidence of goodly gifts emanateth from him and unto him doth it return fear ye god concourse of the foolish and do not inflict tribulations upon those who have willed naught but that which god hath willed moreover if ye heed my call follow not your selfish desires the day is approaching when everything now discernible will have faded away and ye shall weep for having failed in your duty towards god unto this testifieth this inscribed tablet rejoice thou with great joy that we have remembered thee both now and in the past indeed the sweet savors of this remembrance shall endure and shall not change throughout the eternity of the names of god the lord of mankind we have graciously accepted thy devotions thy praise

effendi have been used in preparing this book in many instances his renderings of individual phrases have been incorporated but these are too numerous to list below are listed two categories of translation that have been used one is direct translation of the actual tablet concerned or of excerpts therefrom the second category is slightly less direct in number of his later writings bahá’u’lláh used to quote passages from his own tablets but when doing so he often modified the passage from which he was quoting thus when shoghi effendi’s translations of such quoted passages—as for example in theepistle to the son of the wolf—have been used they have had to be adjusted to agree with the passage as it appeared in the tablet from which bahá’u’lláh was quoting as it is these original tablets that are here translated such adjustments are slight and have not been specially noted but will be apparent to anyone who compares the passages as they appear in this book with the
